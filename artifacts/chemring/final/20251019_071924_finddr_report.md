# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue has shown a consistent growth trend from £401.0m in 2022 to £472.6m in 2023, and further to £510.4m in 2024, indicating a strong upward trajectory with a total growth of approximately 27.3% from 2022 to 2024. The gross margin has slightly decreased from 69.00% in 2023 to 67.61% in 2024, suggesting a potential increase in direct costs or pricing pressures. Revenue by product/service indicates that 'Sensors & Information' grew from £120.5m in 2022 to £212.0m in 2024, while 'Countermeasures & Energetics' increased from £280.5m to £298.4m in the same period, highlighting a significant shift towards the Sensors & Information segment. Geographically, the UK has seen the most substantial growth from £151.8m in 2022 to £229.2m in 2024, while the US revenue has slightly decreased from £181.8m in 2023 to £172.6m in 2024, indicating a potential market saturation or increased competition in that region. |
| Operating Efficiency | The operating margin has shown a decline from 12.32% in 2022 to 11.38% in 2024, indicating a decrease in operational efficiency despite an increase in revenue. Operating income has fluctuated, with £49.4m in 2022, £45.4m in 2023, and £58.1m in 2024, suggesting that while revenue is increasing, the operating income did not grow proportionately in 2023. This could imply rising operational costs or inefficiencies. The relationship between operating income and revenue indicates that while revenue is growing, the operating income growth is not keeping pace, which may require a review of cost management strategies. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has increased significantly from 7.31% in 2022 to 19.89% in 2024, which could impact net profitability and cash flow. This increase may be due to changes in tax legislation or a shift in the company's taxable income profile. Non-recurring items were not explicitly mentioned, but the fluctuations in net profit from £44.4m in 2022 to £42.7m in 2024, with a dip to £37.7m in 2023, suggest potential external pressures or one-off costs affecting profitability. External factors such as market conditions, competition, and economic fluctuations may also be influencing these profitability metrics. |
