# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks including fluctuations in defence spending influenced by political considerations, fiscal constraints, and armed forces requirements. There is a risk of lower defence budgets impacting financial performance, order intake, and investment in long-term technologies. Geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Hamas conflict, and China's military expansion, contribute to a complex threat environment affecting demand. The Group also faces risks from political unrest and changes in political structures in non-NATO countries, which may affect export capabilities and defence budgets. Economic pressures may place defence spending under strain. Market trends show increased defence budgets in key markets, but capability gaps remain. The Group mitigates these risks through engagement with government customers, alignment of growth strategies with government priorities, pursuit of long-term contracts, and focus on commercial business development. Climate change is identified as a market risk affecting business model and strategy, with the Group integrating climate-related risks and opportunities into financial planning and strategy. The Group uses climate-related scenario analysis to assess resilience to climate change impacts. Overall, market risks are medium inherent risk with a low to moderate risk appetite and an increasing trend. | The Group faces market risks primarily related to defence spending fluctuations influenced by political considerations, budgetary constraints, and armed forces requirements. There is a risk of lower defence spending by major customers, which could adversely impact financial performance. The Group's contracts are generally short-term, with limited multi-year coverage, exposing it to order delays or cancellations. Geopolitical tensions, including conflicts in Eastern Europe and political instability in non-NATO countries, increase market uncertainty and risk of disruption. The Group mitigates these risks by aligning growth strategies with government priorities, focusing on commercial product development, pursuing long-term contracts where possible, and maintaining global business development initiatives. The Group also monitors market trends such as increased defence investment driven by Russia-Ukraine conflict and China's military modernization, which create demand for niche energetics and technology-enabled solutions. Ongoing collaboration across businesses and focus on market-leading positions support resilience against market volatility. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include business continuity risks from plant failures, supplier interruptions, quality issues, and large-scale employee absences. Delays in new facility developments may constrain capacity and growth. Manufacturing operations involve energetic materials with inherent safety risks, potentially causing harm to employees and production disruptions. The Group faces risks from cyber-security threats targeting sensitive information and critical systems. Talent market challenges and loss of key personnel pose risks to innovation and contract delivery. Climate change-related operational risks include wildfires, severe weather events, flooding, extreme temperature fluctuations, and precipitation stress, which may disrupt operations and supply chains. The Group mitigates operational risks through major accident hazard analysis, asset integrity programs, business continuity plans, capital investments, cyber-security standards and committees, employee development frameworks, and climate adaptation measures such as drainage improvements and vegetation management. Operational risks have a medium to moderate inherent risk with a low risk appetite and a stable to increasing trend. | Operational risks include business continuity threats from plant failures, supplier interruptions, quality issues, and large-scale employee absences. Delays in new facility developments could constrain capacity and growth. The Group's operations involve energetic materials with inherent safety risks, potentially causing harm to employees or disruption to manufacturing. Environmental risks include liabilities from contamination at current or former sites and compliance with environmental laws. Climate change poses risks from wildfires, severe weather events, and changing weather patterns that could disrupt operations. Cyber-security threats risk critical system failures and data breaches. Talent market challenges and loss of key personnel may impact innovation and contract delivery. The Group mitigates these risks through robust safety culture and standards, asset integrity programs, capital investments in automation and facility modernization, business continuity plans, environmental monitoring and remediation programs, cyber-security standards and incident response, talent development and engagement initiatives, and operational assurance processes. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks primarily include liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate reserves and monitoring cash flows, with committed banking facilities in place until December 2026 and additional loan facilities supported by UK Export Finance. Foreign currency risk arises from translation of foreign subsidiaries' assets and transactional exposures; the Group hedges transactional exposures above £250,000 using forward contracts and treats certain borrowings as net investment hedges. Interest rate risk relates to floating rate borrowings in sterling and US dollars. Credit risk arises from customer defaults, mainly mitigated by trading with government defence departments and prime contractors deemed low risk, use of letters of credit, and provisions for overdue receivables. The Group also faces risks from contingent liabilities and compliance with financing covenants. Mitigation includes regular covenant monitoring, capital approval processes, hedging policies, advance payments, letters of credit, and government grant funding. Financial risks have a low to moderate inherent risk with a decreasing trend. | Financial risks comprise liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash reserves and revolving credit facilities, with undrawn borrowing facilities of £142.9m as of 2023. Foreign currency risk arises from translation of foreign subsidiaries' assets and transactional exposures; the Group hedges transactional exposures above £250,000 using forward contracts and treats US dollar borrowings as net investment hedges. Interest rate risk is managed through a mix of retained profits and bank borrowings, with borrowings subject to floating rates. Credit risk is low due to the Group's customer base of government defence departments and prime contractors, with policies including letters of credit and full provision for receivables overdue beyond 120 days. The Group complies with financial covenants related to leverage and interest cover ratios. Derivative financial instruments are used solely for hedging, not speculative purposes. The Group also faces estimation uncertainty in goodwill and investment recoverability due to forecasting assumptions. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks stem from operating in over 50 countries with diverse legal and regulatory environments, requiring adherence to laws on safety, environment, import-export controls, anti-bribery, corruption, and financial reporting. Non-compliance risks include administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, fines, penalties, reputational damage, and loss of operating permits. The Group mitigates these risks through an Operational Framework mandating compliance policies and procedures, a central legal and compliance function, a Code of Conduct, a Bribery Act Compliance Manual, risk mitigation plans for high-risk territories, and an operational assurance process. Compliance training, whistleblowing mechanisms, and regular audits are in place. The Group also manages risks related to its Special Security Agreement with the US Government. Compliance risks have a medium inherent risk with a low risk appetite and a decreasing trend. | Compliance risks stem from operating in over 50 countries with diverse regulatory environments, requiring adherence to laws on safety, environment, import-export controls, anti-bribery, and corruption. Non-compliance could lead to fines, penalties, loss of permits, and reputational damage. The Group mitigates these risks through an Operational Framework mandating compliance policies and procedures, a central legal and compliance function, a Code of Conduct, an updated Bribery Act Compliance Manual, and risk-based due diligence for third parties and sales partners. The Chemring Compliance Portal automates compliance training, approvals, and monitoring. The ESG Committee oversees compliance performance. The Group also maintains regular engagement with regulators and governing bodies, and conducts internal audits and assurance processes to monitor compliance effectiveness. |
