# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue has shown a consistent growth trend from 2022 to 2024, increasing from 401.0 million GBP in 2022 to 472.6 million GBP in 2023, and further to 510.4 million GBP in 2024, representing a growth of 17.8% from 2022 to 2023 and 8.0% from 2023 to 2024. The gross margin has slightly decreased from 69.00% in 2023 to 67.61% in 2024, indicating a potential increase in direct costs or pricing pressures. Unfortunately, specific revenue breakdowns by product/service and geographic region are not available, limiting insights into which areas are driving revenue growth or facing challenges. |
| Operating Efficiency | The operating margin has shown a decline from 12.32% in 2022 to 9.61% in 2023, followed by a slight recovery to 11.38% in 2024. This suggests that while operating efficiency may have improved in 2024, it is still below the 2022 level. Operating income has increased from 49.4 million GBP in 2022 to 58.1 million GBP in 2024, indicating a positive trend in operational performance despite fluctuations in margins. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that while revenue has increased, the operating margin has not consistently kept pace, suggesting potential areas for cost management improvements. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has increased significantly from 7.31% in 2022 to 14.51% in 2023, and further to 19.89% in 2024. This increase may impact net profitability, as seen in the net profit margin, which has decreased from 11.07% in 2022 to 8.37% in 2024. The tax expense has also risen from 3.5 million GBP in 2022 to 10.6 million GBP in 2024, indicating a growing tax burden. Additionally, interest expense has increased from 1.5 million GBP in 2022 to 4.8 million GBP in 2024, which could be a result of increased borrowing or higher interest rates, further affecting profitability. |
