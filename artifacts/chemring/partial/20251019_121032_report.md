# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth has shown a consistent upward trend from 2022 to 2024, increasing from £401.0m in 2022 to £472.6m in 2023, and further to £510.4m in 2024, representing growth rates of 17.4% and 8.0% respectively. The gross margin has slightly decreased from 69.00% in 2023 to 67.61% in 2024, indicating a potential increase in direct costs or pricing pressures. Revenue by product/service shows that 'Sensors & Information' grew from £120.5m in 2022 to £212.0m in 2024, while 'Countermeasures & Energetics' increased from £280.5m to £298.4m over the same period, suggesting a strong performance in both segments. Geographically, the UK remains the largest market, growing from £151.8m in 2022 to £229.2m in 2024, while the US market has seen a slight decline from £181.8m in 2023 to £172.6m in 2024, indicating a shift in revenue dynamics. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin has shown a decline from 12.32% in 2022 to 11.38% in 2024, despite an increase in operating income from £49.4m in 2022 to £58.1m in 2024. This suggests that while the company is generating more operating income, it is doing so at a lower efficiency relative to revenue. The operating income as a percentage of revenue has improved from 9.61% in 2023 to 11.38% in 2024, indicating better operational performance despite the overall margin decline. Cost management appears to be effective in maintaining operating income growth, but the decrease in operating margin suggests that there may be rising costs that need to be addressed. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has increased significantly from 7.31% in 2022 to 19.89% in 2024, which could impact net profitability. This increase in tax burden may be a result of changes in tax legislation or increased profitability in higher tax brackets. Non-recurring items were not specified, but the fluctuations in net profit, which decreased from £44.4m in 2022 to £42.7m in 2024, could indicate external pressures or one-off costs affecting profitability. Additionally, external factors such as market conditions and economic fluctuations may have influenced revenue growth and cost structures. |

| Future financial performance projection | Based on 2024 data, the company is positioned for continued growth with revenue projected to increase further due to strong performance in the Sensors & Information and Countermeasures & Energetics segments. Cash flow from operations is expected to remain robust, supporting investment activities. However, the high debt-to-equity ratio may limit future financing options. The company should focus on maintaining profitability and managing costs to sustain growth. | In 2023, the company showed promising growth potential with revenue growth trends indicating a strong market position. The increase in cash flow from operations suggests sustainability in financial performance. However, the rising debt levels and effective tax rate may pose challenges.
