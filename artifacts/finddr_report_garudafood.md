Gross margin improved steadily from 25.28% in 2022 to 27.25% in 2023 and 28.55% in 2024, indicating enhanced profitability on sales. Revenue by product shows that packaged foods dominate, growing from approximately IDR 9,322.78 billion in 2022 to IDR 10,737.61 billion in 2024, while beverages revenue fluctuated slightly, decreasing from IDR 1,187.88 billion in 2022 to IDR 1,139.97 billion in 2023, then rising to IDR 1,497.76 billion in 2024.

| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a slight decline from 7.43% in 2023 to 7.02% in 2024 after rising from 6.41% in 2022, suggesting some pressure on operating profitability despite revenue growth. Operating income increased from IDR 674.25 billion in 2022 to IDR 783.02 billion in 2023 and further to IDR 858.88 billion in 2024, but at a slower rate relative to revenue growth.

The cost management challenge is evident as operating expenses grew faster than operating income, slightly compressing operating margin despite higher gross profit. |

The net increase in cash was negative in 2024 at IDR (19,990) billion compared to a positive increase in 2023, indicating cash outflow pressures. These factors combined point to moderate financial risk with increased leverage and reduced liquidity, though interest coverage remains robust, warranting close monitoring of debt levels and cash flow management. | Financial risk indicators suggest reduced leverage risk in 2023, with the debt to equity ratio dropping from 118.63% to 90.01%, indicating less reliance on debt.

The current ratio improved slightly, indicating stable liquidity. The effective tax rate increased marginally from 22.62% to 23.19%, with no indication of significant tax risk changes. No unusual fluctuations or risks are apparent from the data; however, the extremely high returns on equity and assets may warrant further scrutiny. Overall, financial risk appears well managed with improved coverage and reduced leverage in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the companyâs investment activity intensified as net cash from investing activities worsened from IDR (32,557) billion in 2023 to IDR (53,018) billion in 2024, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities also showed increased outflows from IDR (49,462) billion to IDR (79,962) billion, which may relate to debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends paid increased substantially from IDR 221,356,449,930 to IDR 331,916,273,595, reflecting a strong dividend policy and commitment to shareholder returns.

Packaged foods and beverages segments both showed revenue growth, indicating balanced product line expansion. Cash flow sustainability appears challenged by negative net cash increase, but strong operational cash flow and dividend payments suggest confidence in ongoing profitability. Overall, the company is positioned for continued growth with active investment and dividend policies, but must manage cash flow and financing carefully to sustain future performance. | Investment activity in 2023 showed increased cash outflow in investing activities at IDR (32,557) billion compared to IDR (27,694) billion in 2022, indicating ongoing or expanded capital expenditures.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces economic challenges in maintaining business growth amid economic uncertainty, including inflation, fluctuating consumer purchasing power, and rising operational costs. Inflation globally eased to 3.5% in 2024, but labor costs remain high, and commodity prices such as food and metals are volatile, impacting raw material costs in the food and beverage industry. Indonesia's economy showed resilience with GDP growth of 5.03% and controlled inflation at 1.84%, supporting consumer purchasing power. However, the Company must manage cost pressures from increased raw material prices and stricter regulatory compliance, including mandatory halal certification starting October 2024. The Company also faces foreign exchange risk due to exposure to USD and Euro fluctuations, and interest rate risk from bank loans. Additionally, climate change poses physical risks such as erratic weather affecting agricultural yields and supply chain stability, while transition risks arise from evolving sustainability policies requiring investments in environmentally friendly technologies. The Company mitigates these risks through operational efficiency, long-term supplier contracts, digital transformation, and strategic pricing and promotional campaigns to sustain demand amid uncertain market conditions. Economic projections for 2025 indicate moderate global growth and Indonesia's GDP growth at 5.2%, with opportunities in food processing, digitalization, and sustainability, but challenges remain from geopolitical risks, supply chain disruptions, potential VAT increases, and stricter regulations. | The 2023 annual report highlights several economic challenges and uncertainties impacting PT Garudafood Putra Putri Jaya Tbk. Globally, economic conditions remain uncertain due to persistent geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and slowing growth in developed countries such as the US, Europe, and China. Inflation remains elevated globally, with food and energy crises exacerbated by conflicts like Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine, leading to volatile commodity prices including oil, rice, and sugar. These factors contribute to weakening global trade and slower manufacturing recovery. Nationally, Indonesia's economy shows resilience with over 5% growth, but the food and beverage industry experienced a slowdown in growth due to global and national economic deceleration and inflation impacting consumer purchasing power. Climate change poses operational risks including prolonged droughts, water scarcity, inconsistent agricultural yields, and increased natural disasters, affecting raw material supply and production costs. The company faces cost pressures from rising raw material prices and inflation, necessitating intensive cost-efficiency programs and supply chain management. Additionally, uncertainties in foreign exchange rates and interest rates present financial risks. The 2024 outlook anticipates continued global growth slowdown, persistent inflation around 3%, potential oil price increases due to geopolitical conflicts, and climate-related risks such as El Nino-induced droughts affecting commodity production and prices. Domestically, political events like the 2024 elections may stimulate consumption but also add economic uncertainty. Overall, macroeconomic volatility, inflation, commodity price fluctuations, climate change impacts, and geopolitical tensions constitute key economic challenges that could affect the company's revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Company faces competitive pressures from intense market competition, including aggressive promotions by competitors such as MBR to capture market share in key product categories like Prochiz cheese.
