# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Bayan Resources Tbk.'s revenue shows a declining trend from 2022 to 2024, decreasing from 4,703,622,038 USD in 2022 to 3,581,375,403 USD in 2023 and further to 3,446,214,954 USD in 2024. Correspondingly, the gross margin has significantly contracted from 67.18% in 2022 to 46.47% in 2023 and further down to 38.67% in 2024, indicating rising cost pressures or pricing challenges. Revenue is predominantly driven by coal sales, which accounted for 4,692,765,884 USD in 2022, 3,572,081,723 USD in 2023, and 3,425,060,528 USD in 2024, while non-coal revenue remains minimal. Geographically, the majority of revenue is domestic, with 4,703,622,038 USD in 2022, 3,581,375,403 USD in 2023, and 3,446,214,954 USD in 2024, while South East Asia and East Asia regions contribute smaller, stable amounts in 2023 and 2024 but were not distinctly reported in 2022. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin has declined from a strong 65.54% in 2022 to 45.60% in 2023 and further to 34.98% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating profitability. Operating income decreased from 3,082,573,632 USD in 2022 to 1,632,968,496 USD in 2023 and 1,205,522,529 USD in 2024, consistent with the revenue decline. Operating expenses have increased slightly in absolute terms from 77,495,251 USD in 2022 to 113,934,187 USD in 2023 and 120,131,040 USD in 2024, indicating some cost pressures despite lower revenue. The ratio of operating income to revenue has thus deteriorated, suggesting challenges in cost management and operational efficiency amid declining sales. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has remained relatively stable over the period, with 21.86% in 2022, 21.64% in 2023, and 21.75% in 2024, indicating no significant tax policy changes impacting profitability. There are no explicitly listed non-recurring items or one-off impacts in the provided financial data. External factors affecting profitability are not explicitly detailed in the data, so their impact cannot be assessed. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Bayan Resources Tbk. showed an overall improvement in financial health compared to 2023. Total assets increased slightly from USD 3,444,319,816 to USD 3,521,455,934, driven by a notable rise in non-current assets from USD 1,543,125,701 to USD 1,755,892,105, while current assets decreased from USD 1,901,194,115 to USD 1,765,563,829. Total liabilities declined significantly from USD 1,465,501,614 to USD 1,207,613,523, with both current liabilities and non-current liabilities decreasing, indicating reduced obligations. Shareholders' equity rose substantially from USD 1,978,818,202 to USD 2,313,842,411, reflecting stronger capitalization. The current ratio improved from 142.03% to 164.04%, suggesting enhanced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 74.06% to 52.19%, indicating a more conservative capital structure with less leverage. Overall, the company strengthened its balance sheet with higher equity, lower liabilities, and improved liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, PT Bayan Resources Tbk. experienced a decline in total assets to USD 3,444,319,816 from USD 3,945,458,865 in 2022, reflecting a reduction in asset base primarily driven by a decrease in current assets from USD 2,400,423,237 to USD 1,901,194,115. Non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities decreased significantly to USD 1,465,501,614 from USD 1,950,168,318, with both current and non-current liabilities showing reductions. Shareholders' equity slightly decreased to USD 1,978,818,202 from USD 1,995,290,547, indicating a relatively stable capital base. The current ratio improved to 142.03% from 131.06%, suggesting enhanced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved markedly to 74.06% from 97.74%, indicating a stronger capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained a solid financial position in 2023 with improved liquidity and lower leverage despite a contraction in total assets. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 declined compared to 2023. Revenue decreased from USD 3,581,375,403 to USD 3,446,214,954, primarily due to lower coal revenue (from USD 3,572,081,723 to USD 3,425,060,528), despite an increase in non-coal revenue (from USD 9,293,680 to USD 21,154,426). Cost of goods sold increased from USD 1,917,152,140 to USD 2,113,429,456, which compressed gross profit from USD 1,664,223,263 to USD 1,332,785,498. Consequently, gross margin declined from 46.47% to 38.67%. Operating expenses rose slightly, leading to a drop in operating income from USD 1,632,968,496 to USD 1,205,522,529 and a decrease in operating margin from 45.60% to 34.98%. Net profit fell from USD 1,279,580,842 to USD 943,375,066, with net profit margin decreasing from 35.73% to 27.37%. Return on equity and return on assets also declined from 64.40% to 43.95% and from 34.63% to 27.09%, respectively. The effective tax rate remained stable at about 21.7%. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2024 due to lower revenue and higher costs, resulting in reduced profitability ratios. | The company’s revenue declined by approximately 23.8% to USD 3,581,375,403 in 2023 from USD 4,703,622,038 in 2022, primarily due to lower coal sales which dropped from USD 4,692,765,884 to USD 3,572,081,723. Cost of goods sold increased to USD 1,917,152,140 from USD 1,543,600,000, causing gross profit to fall sharply to USD 1,664,223,263 from USD 3,160,068,883. Consequently, gross margin decreased significantly to 46.47% from 67.18%. Operating expenses increased moderately, leading to a reduced operating income of USD 1,632,968,496 compared to USD 3,082,573,632, and a lower operating margin of 45.60% versus 65.54%. Net profit declined to USD 1,279,580,842 from USD 2,301,605,547, with net profit margin dropping to 35.73% from 48.93%. Return on equity and return on assets were reported at strong levels of 64.40% and 34.63%, respectively, indicating high earnings quality despite lower absolute profits. The effective tax rate remained stable at approximately 21.64%. Overall, profitability weakened in absolute terms but maintained strong returns relative to equity and assets. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2024. The company experienced an increase in cost of goods sold despite lower revenue, indicating some cost pressures or lower cost control effectiveness. Operating expenses increased marginally from USD 113,934,187 to USD 120,131,040. Asset turnover improved slightly from 96.93% to 98.95%, suggesting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased significantly from USD 731,403,991 to USD 1,059,843,624, reflecting stronger cash generation capability despite lower net profit. Inventories increased from USD 201,810,803 to USD 248,039,850, which may indicate higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Working capital improved as current assets decreased less than current liabilities, supported by a higher current ratio. Cash flow from investing activities remained negative but improved (less cash outflow) from USD (205,173,499) to USD (166,510,975). Overall, operational cash flow strength improved, but cost control and inventory management may require attention. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed signs of strain as cost of goods sold increased despite lower revenues, indicating higher production or procurement costs. Operating expenses rose to USD 113,934,187 from USD 77,495,251, reflecting less effective cost control. Asset turnover was notably high at 96.93%, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations dropped substantially to USD 731,403,991 from USD 2,129,632,026, indicating reduced cash generation capability. Working capital decreased as current assets fell more than current liabilities, though the current ratio improved. Cash flow from investing activities remained negative at USD (205,173,499), slightly higher than the prior year, indicating ongoing investment. Net cash from financing activities was negative USD (1,447,235,216), reflecting significant cash outflows, possibly related to dividend payments which increased to USD 2,300,000,105 from USD 1,800,000,090. Overall, operational efficiency was challenged by rising costs and reduced cash flow from operations despite high asset turnover. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 suggest reduced leverage and strong liquidity, lowering financial risk. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 74.06% to 52.19%, indicating less reliance on debt financing. The current ratio improved from 142.03% to 164.04%, showing enhanced short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased from USD 6,630,453 to USD 17,838,242, but interest coverage ratio remained very high, though it declined from 24,628.31% to 6,758.08%, still indicating ample ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate was stable at approximately 21.7%, implying no significant tax risk changes. The reduction in total liabilities and improved equity base further mitigate financial risk. No other explicit risk factors are evident from the data. Overall, financial risk appears to have decreased in 2024 due to stronger liquidity and lower leverage despite higher interest expense. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a reduced leverage risk with debt to equity ratio improving to 74.06% from 97.74%. Liquidity risk appears mitigated with an improved current ratio of 142.03%. Interest expense decreased slightly to USD 6,630,453 from USD 7,759,545, while interest coverage remained extremely strong at 24,628.31%, indicating ample capacity to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate was stable at 21.64%, suggesting no significant tax-related risk changes. However, the sharp decline in net cash from operations and the large negative net cash flow from financing activities, combined with increased dividend payouts, may pose cash flow sustainability risks. The increase in inventories to USD 201,810,803 from USD 118,194,855 could indicate potential inventory management risks. Overall, while leverage and liquidity risks have improved, cash flow pressures and inventory buildup warrant monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Future financial performance indicators show cautious optimism. The company maintained positive net cash from operations at USD 1,059,843,624, supporting cash flow sustainability. Net cash used in investing activities decreased, indicating potentially lower capital expenditure or investment outflows (USD (166,510,975) versus USD (205,173,499) in 2023). Financing cash outflows also reduced significantly from USD (1,447,235,216) to USD (879,436,143), possibly reflecting lower debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends paid decreased substantially from USD 2,300,000,105 to USD 1,100,000,055, which may indicate a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. Revenue by geographic region remained stable with domestic revenue slightly lower but Southeast Asia and East Asia revenues unchanged, suggesting steady market presence. The increase in non-coal revenue, though small, may signal diversification efforts. Overall, the company appears to be focusing on maintaining strong operational cash flow, reducing financing outflows, and preserving liquidity, which bodes well for sustainable future performance, though profitability pressures remain a concern. | The company’s investment activity remained negative with net cash used in investing at USD (205,173,499), slightly higher than the prior year, indicating continued capital expenditure or acquisitions. Dividend payments increased substantially to USD 2,300,000,105, which may impact cash reserves given the reduced operational cash flow. The substantial decline in net cash from operations to USD 731,403,991 raises concerns about cash flow sustainability if revenue pressures persist. Geographically, the majority of revenue remains domestic at USD 3,581,375,403, with smaller contributions from South East Asia and East Asia, suggesting reliance on the domestic market. The decline in coal revenue may indicate challenges in the core product segment. Given these factors, future financial performance may face headwinds unless operational efficiencies improve and cash flow generation strengthens. Dividend policy appears aggressive relative to cash flow, which could constrain liquidity going forward. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces several economic challenges and uncertainties as outlined in the 2024 annual report. Inflation has been significant in 2024 and is expected to continue into 2025, impacting the entire coal industry by increasing costs. While the Company benefits from being in the lowest cost quartile in the seaborne thermal coal market, inflationary pressures could still affect profitability. Global economic growth is predicted to remain stable but faces risks including financial market volatility, tighter financial conditions especially in developing countries, slower global disinflation, prolonged contraction in China's property sector, and rising protectionist policies that exacerbate trade tensions. Geopolitical tensions, particularly in Ukraine/Russia and Israel/Gaza, threaten energy markets and supply chains, potentially driving inflation higher and dampening economic activity. The coal market outlook for 2025 indicates a slight oversupply with weakening prices and shifting demand patterns due to the transition to renewable energy sources. Demand growth is slowing, with global coal consumption expected to peak in 2024 and decline thereafter, driven by reduced demand in China and Europe, though India’s demand remains robust. The Company also faces cost pressures from government policies in Indonesia, including export proceeds lock-up, subsidy removals increasing diesel fuel costs by 25-30%, mandatory coal pricing using government reference prices, and potential levies on non-compliant producers. Weather-related disruptions, such as El Nino and La Nina, continue to impact coal supply and logistics, affecting production and transport. Interest rate risks exist due to variable rate borrowings, though exposure is monitored and considered manageable. Foreign exchange risk is minimal due to natural hedging with US Dollar denominated revenues and costs. Overall, economic uncertainties include inflation, geopolitical tensions, regulatory changes, market oversupply, and energy transition impacts that could affect revenue and profitability. | The Company faces several economic challenges and uncertainties impacting its revenue and profitability. Inflation has been significant in 2023 and is expected to continue into 2024, affecting all coal producers industry-wide. While the Company benefits from being in the lowest cost quartile, inflationary pressures could still impact costs. The global coal market experienced volatility with demand declining in advanced economies like the EU and US, while growth in China, India, and ASEAN offsets these declines. Economic moderation and weakening factors that previously supported coal-fired power generation have slowed demand growth. Geopolitical tensions (Ukraine/Russia, Israel/Gaza, US/Iran) create uncertainties affecting oil and gas markets, which in turn influence coal prices. Weather events such as El Nino and La Nina continue to impact coal supply and logistics, particularly in Australia and Indonesia. Government policies including increased royalties, financial penalties for Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) non-compliance, and export proceeds regulations (DHE) increase cost pressures. The Company also faces risks from foreign exchange fluctuations, interest rate changes, and credit risks, although it manages these through hedging and risk management programs. The coal price volatility and potential for price floor breaches pose risks to profitability, especially for higher-cost producers. The Company anticipates production growth from infrastructure investments but must manage operational risks including equipment availability, contractor performance, and regulatory compliance amid these economic uncertainties. |
