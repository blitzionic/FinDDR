| Operational efficiency | In 2024, operational efficiency improved significantly, with an operating margin of 54.12%, reflecting effective cost management despite increased revenues. The asset turnover ratio increased to 113.97%, indicating that the company is utilizing its assets more effectively to generate sales. Net cash from operations reached $28,090 million, a substantial increase from $5,641 million in 2023, demonstrating strong cash generation capabilities. Working capital management appears effective, with inventories slightly increasing to $5,282 million, suggesting that the company is managing its stock levels well in relation to sales growth. | In 2023, the operating margin was 15.66%, which indicates challenges in controlling operating expenses relative to revenue.

The interest coverage ratio was 1,612.21%, which, while still strong, was much lower than in 2024, suggesting potential vulnerability in meeting interest obligations if profitability declines. The current ratio of 351.56% indicated adequate liquidity, but the decrease from previous years raised concerns about short-term financial stability. The effective tax rate was low at 4.47%, which may have contributed to higher net profits but also indicates potential volatility in future tax obligations. |
| Future financial performance projection | Based on the strong performance in 2024, the company is well-positioned for future growth. The significant increase in revenue and profitability suggests that investment activities are likely to continue, particularly in the Compute & Networking segment, which generated $47,405 million in revenue. Cash flow from operations is sustainable at $28,090 million, allowing for potential reinvestment in growth initiatives. The company may consider increasing dividends, although the current policy remains conservative with dividends at $395 million. Market expansion, particularly in the United States and Taiwan, indicates potential for further revenue growth. | In 2023, the company showed signs of recovery, but the financial performance projections were less optimistic compared to 2024. Revenue growth was modest, and profitability metrics indicated challenges in sustaining earnings. The net cash from operations of $5,641 million was insufficient to support aggressive investment activities, leading to a cautious approach in future growth strategies. The company may need to focus on improving operational efficiency and managing costs to enhance cash flow sustainability. Market expansion efforts were evident, but the overall growth indicators were not as strong as in 2024. |
