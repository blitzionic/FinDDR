# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company experienced a significant revenue increase from 2022 to 2024, with revenue growing marginally from $26,914m in 2022 to $26,974m in 2023 (0.22% growth), followed by a substantial jump to $60,922m in 2024 (126.1% growth from 2023). Gross profit showed a contrasting trend, decreasing from $17,475m in 2022 to $15,356m in 2023 (-12.1%), then sharply increasing to $44,301m in 2024 (188.7% growth from 2023). Correspondingly, gross margin declined from 64.93% in 2022 to 56.93% in 2023, then improved markedly to 72.72% in 2024, indicating improved cost control or pricing power in 2024. Revenue by product/service reveals a major shift: Compute & Networking revenue surged from $15,068m in 2023 to $47,405m in 2024 (214.7% increase), while Graphics revenue grew modestly from $11,906m to $13,517m (13.5% increase). No geographic revenue data is available for analysis. Overall, the revenue growth is driven primarily by the Compute & Networking segment, which also likely contributed to the improved gross margin in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed volatility, dropping from 37.31% in 2022 to 15.66% in 2023, then rebounding strongly to 54.12% in 2024. Operating income followed a similar pattern: $10,041m in 2022, declining to $4,224m in 2023 (-57.9%), then surging to $32,972m in 2024 (680.5% increase from 2023). Despite operating expenses increasing slightly from $7,434m in 2022 to $11,132m in 2023 (49.7% increase) and $11,329m in 2024 (1.8% increase from 2023), the operating income growth in 2024 far outpaced expense growth, indicating improved operational leverage and cost management effectiveness. The operating income to revenue ratio improved significantly in 2024, reflecting enhanced efficiency and profitability. The relatively stable operating expenses in 2023-2024 despite large revenue growth suggest strong cost control measures. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted dramatically over the period: 1.90% in 2022, turning negative to -4.47% in 2023 (indicating a tax benefit or credit), then rising to 12.00% in 2024. The negative tax expense in 2023 ($-187m) contrasts with positive tax expenses in 2022 ($189m) and 2024 ($4,058m), suggesting a one-off tax benefit or adjustment in 2023 that temporarily boosted net profit margins. Net profit margin reflects these tax impacts, dropping from 36.23% in 2022 to 16.19% in 2023, then increasing to 48.85% in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors are detailed in the data, but the unusual tax rate and expense in 2023 imply a one-off tax event affecting profitability that year. The strong recovery in 2024 net profit margin and tax rate normalization indicate a return to typical tax conditions. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a significantly strengthened financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased substantially from $41,182 million to $65,728 million, driven by growth in both current assets (from $23,073 million to $44,345 million) and non-current assets (from $18,109 million to $21,383 million). Total liabilities rose moderately from $19,081 million to $22,750 million, with current liabilities increasing from $6,563 million to $10,631 million while non-current liabilities slightly decreased from $12,518 million to $12,119 million. Shareholders' equity nearly doubled from $22,101 million to $42,978 million, supported by a large increase in retained earnings from $10,171 million to $29,817 million. Liquidity improved as reflected by the current ratio rising from 351.56% to 417.13%, indicating a stronger ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 86.34% to 52.93%, signaling a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet shows robust asset growth, effective liability management, and a solid equity base, enhancing the company's financial health in 2024. | In 2023, the company experienced a decline in total assets from $44,187 million in 2022 to $41,182 million, indicating a contraction in asset base. Current assets decreased significantly from $28,829 million to $23,073 million, while non-current assets increased from $15,358 million to $18,109 million, suggesting a shift towards longer-term investments or capital assets. Total liabilities rose from $17,575 million to $19,081 million, driven primarily by an increase in current liabilities from $4,335 million to $6,563 million, despite a reduction in non-current liabilities from $13,240 million to $12,518 million. Shareholders' equity declined from $26,612 million to $22,101 million, reflecting reduced retained earnings which fell from $16,235 million to $10,171 million. The current ratio dropped sharply from 665.03% to 351.56%, indicating a decrease in short-term liquidity, though it remains above 1, suggesting the company can cover current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio increased from 66.04% to 86.34%, signaling higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company’s financial position weakened in 2023 with lower asset base, higher liabilities, and reduced equity, alongside diminished liquidity and increased leverage. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company experienced remarkable profitability growth in 2024. Revenue more than doubled from $26,974 million in 2023 to $60,922 million in 2024. Gross profit surged from $15,356 million to $44,301 million, resulting in a gross margin improvement from 56.93% to 72.72%. Operating income increased dramatically from $4,224 million to $32,972 million, lifting the operating margin from 15.66% to 54.12%. Net profit rose from $4,368 million to $29,760 million, with the net profit margin expanding from 16.19% to 48.85%. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) also showed exceptional improvement, with ROE increasing from 17.93% to 91.46% and ROA from 10.23% to 55.67%, indicating highly efficient use of equity and assets to generate earnings. The effective tax rate shifted from a negative rate (-4.47%) in 2023 to a positive 12.00% in 2024, reflecting normalized tax expenses. Overall, the earnings quality is strong and sustainable given the substantial margin expansions and return ratios. | Revenue in 2023 was relatively flat compared to 2022, increasing marginally from $26,914 million to $26,974 million. However, cost of goods sold rose substantially from $9,439 million to $11,618 million, causing gross profit to decline from $17,475 million to $15,356 million and gross margin to fall from 64.93% to 56.93%. Operating expenses increased sharply from $7,434 million to $11,132 million, resulting in operating income dropping by more than half from $10,041 million to $4,224 million and operating margin declining from 37.31% to 15.66%. Net profit also decreased significantly from $9,752 million to $4,368 million, with net profit margin falling from 36.23% to 16.19%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 17.93% and 10.23% respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and assets despite the declines. The effective tax rate turned negative at -4.47% compared to 1.90% in 2022, reflecting a tax benefit or credit that improved net income. Overall, profitability and earnings quality deteriorated in 2023 due to rising costs and expenses, compressing margins and net income despite stable revenue. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved markedly in 2024. Despite a moderate increase in operating expenses from $11,132 million to $11,329 million, the company achieved a significant rise in operating income, indicating effective cost control relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover increased from 63.19% to 113.97%, showing enhanced utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations surged from $5,641 million to $28,090 million, reflecting strong cash generation capability. Inventories remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $5,159 million to $5,282 million, suggesting efficient inventory management despite higher sales. The current ratio improvement also supports better working capital management. These factors collectively indicate improved operational efficiency and strong cash flow performance in 2024. | The operating margin contracted significantly to 15.66% in 2023 from 37.31% in 2022, indicating reduced cost control and efficiency in operations. The increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses outpaced revenue growth, negatively impacting profitability. Asset turnover was reported at 63.19% in 2023, but no prior year comparison is available; this suggests the company generated $0.63 in revenue for every dollar of assets, which may indicate moderate asset utilization. Net cash from operations declined from $9,108 million in 2022 to $5,641 million in 2023, reflecting lower cash generation from core business activities. Working capital pressure is evident as current liabilities increased while current assets decreased, reducing liquidity. Inventories nearly doubled from $2,605 million to $5,159 million, which could indicate potential overstocking or slower inventory turnover, negatively affecting operational efficiency. Overall, operational efficiency worsened in 2023 with margin compression, lower cash flow from operations, and increased inventory levels. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators suggest reduced leverage and improved liquidity in 2024. The debt to equity ratio declined from 86.34% to 52.93%, indicating lower reliance on debt financing. Interest expense remained stable and low at approximately $257 million, with interest coverage ratio improving dramatically from -1612.21% to -12829.57%, reflecting a very strong ability to cover interest obligations from operating income. The current ratio increased to 417.13%, signaling excellent short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate normalized to 12.00%, removing the unusual negative tax rate seen in 2023. No significant increase in non-current liabilities was observed, and dividends remained stable at around $395 million. Overall, the company exhibits low financial risk with strong liquidity and manageable leverage in 2024. | Financial risk increased in 2023 as evidenced by a higher debt to equity ratio rising from 66.04% to 86.34%, indicating greater leverage and potential solvency risk. The current ratio decreased substantially from 665.03% to 351.56%, signaling reduced liquidity and a tighter short-term financial position. Interest expense increased slightly from $236 million to $262 million, while interest coverage ratio, though negative in both years, improved from -4254.66% to -1612.21%, which remains a concern as it suggests operating income is insufficient to cover interest expenses comfortably. The effective tax rate turned negative at -4.47%, which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces uncertainty in tax expense predictability. The increase in current liabilities and inventories, combined with declining cash flow from operations, heightens liquidity risk. Overall, the company faces elevated financial risk in 2023 due to increased leverage, reduced liquidity, and ongoing challenges in covering interest obligations. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company’s future financial performance appears promising based on 2024 data. Investment activities increased, with net cash from investing rising from $7,375 million to $10,566 million, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions to support growth. Net cash from financing also increased from $11,617 million to $13,633 million, suggesting continued access to capital markets or debt financing to fund expansion. The substantial increase in retained earnings and shareholders' equity supports reinvestment capacity. Dividend payments remained stable, reflecting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the Compute & Networking segment, which grew from $15,068 million to $47,405 million, while Graphics revenue increased modestly. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. Overall, the company is positioned for sustained growth with strong cash flow sustainability and investment in growth initiatives. | Investment activities, as reflected by net cash from investing, decreased from $9,830 million in 2022 to $7,375 million in 2023, indicating a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions. Net cash from financing surged from $1,865 million to $11,617 million, suggesting significant new financing or debt issuance to support operations or investments. Despite lower operational cash flow, the company maintained a positive net increase in cash of $1,399 million, slightly higher than 2022. Dividends remained stable at approximately $398 million, indicating a consistent dividend policy despite earnings pressure. Revenue segmentation in 2023 shows $15,068 million from Compute & Networking and $11,906 million from Graphics, but no prior year data is available to assess growth trends by segment. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional growth analysis. The increase in non-current assets and financing cash inflows may support future growth, but current profitability and liquidity challenges could constrain performance. Overall, the company’s future financial performance depends on managing operational inefficiencies and leveraging investments funded by increased financing while sustaining cash flow and dividend commitments. |
