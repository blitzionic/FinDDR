Other countries' revenue rose 73.3%. The US share of total revenue increased substantially, indicating a shift in market focus or demand concentration. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved significantly to 54.12% in 2024 from 15.66% in 2023, recovering from a decline from 37.31% in 2022 to 15.66% in 2023. Operating income surged from $4,224M in 2023 to $32,972M in 2024, a 680% increase, outpacing revenue growth, indicating strong operational leverage and efficiency gains. Operating expenses remained relatively stable from 2023 ($11,132M) to 2024 ($11,329M), despite the large revenue increase, demonstrating effective cost management and scalability. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved markedly, reflecting enhanced profitability and operational control. The prior year showed deterioration in operating margin and income despite flat revenue, suggesting challenges that were effectively addressed in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased to 12.00% in 2024 from 4.47% in 2023 and 1.90% in 2022, indicating a higher tax burden or reduced tax benefits, which slightly moderated net profit growth. Income tax expense rose to $4,058M in 2024 from a negative tax expense (-$187M) in 2023, suggesting prior year tax credits or adjustments. No explicit non-recurring items are reported, but the negative tax expense in 2023 may indicate unusual tax events. External factors such as geographic revenue shifts, especially the strong US market growth, may have influenced tax and profitability dynamics. Overall, despite higher tax rates, net profit margin improved to 48.85% in 2024, reflecting strong core profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a significantly strengthened financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased substantially from $41,182 million to $65,728 million, driven by growth in both current assets (from $23,073 million to $44,345 million) and non-current assets (from $18,109 million to $21,383 million). Total liabilities rose moderately from $19,081 million to $22,750 million, with current liabilities increasing from $6,563 million to $10,631 million while non-current liabilities slightly decreased from $12,518 million to $12,119 million.

Liquidity improved as reflected by the current ratio rising from 351.56% to 417.13%, indicating a stronger ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 86.34% to 52.93%, signaling a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet shows robust asset growth, prudent liability management, and a solid equity base, enhancing the company’s financial health in 2024. | In 2023, the company experienced a decline in total assets from $44,187 million in 2022 to $41,182 million, indicating a contraction in asset base. Current assets decreased significantly from $28,829 million to $23,073 million, while non-current assets increased from $15,358 million to $18,109 million, suggesting a shift towards longer-term investments or capital assets. Total liabilities rose from $17,575 million to $19,081 million, driven primarily by an increase in current liabilities from $4,335 million to $6,563 million, despite a reduction in non-current liabilities from $13,240 million to $12,518 million. Shareholders' equity declined from $26,612 million to $22,101 million, reflecting reduced retained earnings which fell from $16,235 million to $10,171 million. The current ratio dropped sharply from 665.03% to 351.56%, indicating a weakening liquidity position, while the debt to equity ratio increased from 66.04% to 86.34%, signaling higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the financial position in 2023 shows reduced asset size, increased liabilities, and diminished equity, pointing to a weaker balance sheet and tighter liquidity compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company’s profitability improved dramatically in 2024. Revenue more than doubled from $26,974 million in 2023 to $60,922 million in 2024. Gross profit surged from $15,356 million to $44,301 million, resulting in a gross margin increase from 56.93% to 72.72%, indicating improved cost efficiency or pricing power. Operating income rose sharply from $4,224 million to $32,972 million, lifting the operating margin from 15.66% to 54.12%. Net profit increased nearly sevenfold from $4,368 million to $29,760 million, with the net profit margin expanding from 16.19% to 48.85%, reflecting strong earnings quality and sustainability. Return on equity (ROE) soared from 17.93% to 91.46%, and return on assets (ROA) increased from 10.23% to 55.67%, demonstrating highly efficient use of equity and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate rose from 4.47% to 12.00%, but this did not materially dampen net profitability. Overall, the company achieved exceptional earnings growth and margin expansion in 2024, indicating high-quality and sustainable profitability. | Revenue in 2023 was relatively flat at $26,974 million compared to $26,914 million in 2022, showing no significant growth. However, cost of goods sold increased substantially from $9,439 million to $11,618 million, causing gross profit to decline from $17,475 million to $15,356 million. This led to a decrease in gross margin from 64.93% to 56.93%. Operating expenses rose sharply from $7,434 million to $11,132 million, resulting in operating income dropping by more than half from $10,041 million to $4,224 million and operating margin falling from 37.31% to 15.66%. Net profit also declined significantly from $9,752 million to $4,368 million, with net profit margin decreasing from 36.23% to 16.19%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 17.93% and 10.23% respectively, indicating moderate profitability but lower than implied by 2022's higher margins. The effective tax rate increased from 1.90% to 4.47%, and income tax expense turned negative, suggesting tax benefits or adjustments. Overall, earnings quality in 2023 weakened due to margin compression and higher expenses despite stable revenue. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved markedly in 2024. Operating expenses remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $11,132 million to $11,329 million despite the large revenue growth, indicating effective cost control. The operating margin increased significantly to 54.12%, reflecting strong cost management relative to revenue. Asset turnover improved from 63.19% to 113.97%, showing enhanced utilization of assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations increased substantially from $5,641 million to $28,090 million, indicating strong cash generation capacity. Inventories remained nearly flat, increasing marginally from $5,159 million to $5,282 million, suggesting efficient inventory management despite higher sales volumes. The current ratio improvement to 417.13% also supports strong working capital management. Overall, the company demonstrated excellent operational efficiency through cost control, asset utilization, and robust cash flow generation in 2024. | The operating margin in 2023 declined significantly to 15.66% from 37.31% in 2022, reflecting increased cost pressures and less effective cost control. Asset turnover was reported at 63.19% in 2023 (not available in 2022), indicating the company generated $0.63 in revenue for every dollar of assets, which suggests moderate asset utilization. Net cash from operations decreased from $9,108 million in 2022 to $5,641 million in 2023, indicating reduced cash generation from core business activities. Inventories nearly doubled from $2,605 million to $5,159 million, which may imply slower inventory turnover or buildup of stock. Working capital management appears strained as current liabilities increased while current assets decreased, contributing to a lower current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency deteriorated in 2023 with lower margins, reduced cash flow from operations, and potential inventory management challenges. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators improved in 2024. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 86.34% to 52.93%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. Interest expense remained stable at approximately $257 million, while interest coverage ratio increased dramatically from 1612.21% to 12,829.57%, reflecting a vastly improved ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate increased from 4.47% to 12.00%, which may reflect changes in tax policy or profitability mix but remains moderate. Liquidity improved as shown by the current ratio rising to 417.13%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. No significant increase in non-current liabilities was observed, and the company maintained a strong equity base. Overall, the company’s financial risk profile improved with lower leverage, stronger interest coverage, and enhanced liquidity in 2024. | Leverage increased in 2023 as evidenced by the rise in debt to equity ratio from 66.04% to 86.34%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. The current ratio fell from 665.03% to 351.56%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity and potential challenges in meeting current obligations. Interest expense increased slightly from $236 million to $262 million, but interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 1612.21%, down from an exceptionally high 4254.66% in 2022, indicating the company still comfortably covers interest payments despite increased leverage. The effective tax rate rose from 1.90% to 4.47%, and income tax expense turned negative, which may reflect tax credits or adjustments but also introduces some variability in tax obligations. Overall, financial risk increased moderately due to higher leverage and weaker liquidity, though interest coverage remains robust, mitigating immediate solvency concerns. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a shift with net cash from investing turning negative at $(10,566) million compared to a positive $7,375 million in 2023, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing remained negative at $(13,633) million, slightly higher than 2023, reflecting continued debt repayment or shareholder returns. The company maintained a stable dividend payout around $(395) million, suggesting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the Compute & Networking segment, which increased from $15,068 million to $47,405 million, while Graphics revenue grew modestly from $11,906 million to $13,517 million. Geographically, all regions showed strong revenue growth, with the United States revenue more than tripling from $8,292 million to $26,966 million, indicating expanding market penetration. The strong operational cash flow of $28,090 million supports cash flow sustainability despite increased investing outflows. Overall, the company is positioned for continued growth supported by strategic investments, strong cash flow generation, and expanding market presence in key segments and geographies. | Investment activities in 2023 showed a positive net cash from investing of $7,375 million compared to a negative $9,830 million in 2022, indicating asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures which may limit future growth. Net cash from financing was negative $11,617 million in 2023 versus positive $1,865 million in 2022, suggesting significant debt repayments or share buybacks, consistent with the reduction in shareholders' equity. Dividends remained stable at approximately $398 million, indicating a consistent dividend policy despite lower earnings. Revenue by product shows a shift with Compute & Networking revenue increasing from $11,046 million to $15,068 million, while Graphics revenue declined from $15,868 million to $11,906 million, signaling a strategic or market-driven shift in product focus. Geographically, revenue from the United States nearly doubled from $4,349 million to $8,292 million, while revenues from Taiwan, China, and other countries declined, indicating a concentration in the US market. These trends suggest the company may focus on growth in Compute & Networking and the US region, but the reduced investing outflows and cash from operations may constrain expansion. Cash flow sustainability appears challenged but dividend payments remain steady, reflecting a cautious but stable financial policy. |
