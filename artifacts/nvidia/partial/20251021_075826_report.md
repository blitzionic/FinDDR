# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company experienced a significant revenue surge from 2023 to 2024, with revenue increasing from $26,974M to $60,922M, a growth of approximately 125.7%, following a flat growth of 0.22% from 2022 to 2023. Gross margin improved markedly in 2024 to 72.72% from 56.93% in 2023, reversing the prior decline from 64.93% in 2022 to 56.93% in 2023. This indicates enhanced cost control or higher-margin product mix in 2024. Revenue by product shows a major shift: Compute & Networking revenue jumped from $15,068M in 2023 to $47,405M in 2024 (214.6% increase), while Graphics revenue declined from $11,906M to $13,517M (13.5% increase) after a prior drop from $15,868M in 2022. This suggests a strategic pivot or market demand shift favoring Compute & Networking. Geographically, the United States revenue grew sharply from $8,292M in 2023 to $26,966M in 2024 (225.1% increase), becoming the largest region by revenue, while Taiwan and China showed moderate growth (Taiwan: 13,405M vs 6,986M in 2023; China: 10,306M vs 5,785M). Other countries also nearly doubled revenue. The geographic distribution shifted towards the US dominance, indicating successful market penetration or expansion there. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved dramatically to 54.12% in 2024 from 15.66% in 2023, surpassing the 37.31% margin in 2022. Operating income surged to $32,972M in 2024 from $4,224M in 2023, reflecting a strong operating leverage effect given the revenue growth. Operating expenses remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $11,132M in 2023 to $11,329M in 2024, despite the more than doubling of revenue, indicating effective cost management and scalability. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved substantially, highlighting enhanced operational efficiency and profitability. The company managed to contain operating expenses while significantly increasing gross profit, driving a robust operating income expansion. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased to 12.00% in 2024 from 4.47% in 2023 and 1.90% in 2022, indicating a higher tax burden or reduced tax benefits in 2024. Income tax expense rose to $4,058M in 2024 from a negative tax expense (tax benefit) of -$187M in 2023, which may reflect the absence of prior year tax credits or one-off tax adjustments. No explicit non-recurring items are reported, but the negative tax expense in 2023 suggests unusual tax-related events that year. External factors such as the substantial revenue growth in the US market and the shift in product mix towards Compute & Networking likely contributed positively to profitability, while the increased tax rate slightly offset net profit gains. Overall, external and one-off impacts appear limited but notable in tax expense fluctuations. |
