# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company experienced a substantial revenue increase from 2022 to 2024, with revenue growing from $26,914M in 2022 to $26,974M in 2023 (a marginal 0.22% increase), then surging to $60,922M in 2024, representing a 125.8% increase from 2023. Gross profit showed a mixed trend: it decreased from $17,475M in 2022 to $15,356M in 2023 (-12.1%), then sharply increased to $44,301M in 2024 (+188.7%). Correspondingly, gross margin declined from 64.93% in 2022 to 56.93% in 2023, then improved significantly to 72.72% in 2024, indicating improved cost control or pricing power in 2024. Revenue by product/service reveals a major shift: Compute & Networking revenue grew dramatically from $11,046M in 2022 to $15,068M in 2023 (+36.4%) and then to $47,405M in 2024 (+214.6%), becoming the dominant segment. Conversely, Graphics revenue declined from $15,868M in 2022 to $11,906M in 2023 (-25.0%) and then slightly increased to $13,517M in 2024 (+13.5%), indicating a strategic shift or market demand change favoring Compute & Networking. Geographically, revenue distribution shifted notably: United States revenue grew from $4,349M in 2022 to $8,292M in 2023 (+90.6%) and then to $26,966M in 2024 (+225.1%), becoming the largest region by 2024. Taiwan revenue decreased from $8,544M in 2022 to $6,986M in 2023 (-18.3%) and then increased to $13,405M in 2024 (+91.8%). China (including Hong Kong) revenue declined from $7,111M in 2022 to $5,785M in 2023 (-18.6%) but rebounded to $10,306M in 2024 (+78.1%). Other countries showed steady growth from $6,910M in 2022 to $5,911M in 2023 (-14.5%) and then to $10,245M in 2024 (+73.4%). Overall, the company’s revenue growth is driven by strong expansion in Compute & Networking and the U.S. market, with gross margin improvements supporting profitability. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed volatility but a strong recovery in 2024: it declined from 37.31% in 2022 to 15.66% in 2023, then surged to 54.12% in 2024. Operating income followed a similar pattern, decreasing from $10,041M in 2022 to $4,224M in 2023 (-57.9%), then increasing sharply to $32,972M in 2024 (+680.5%). Despite a large revenue increase in 2024, operating expenses remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $11,132M in 2023 to $11,329M in 2024 (+1.8%), after a significant rise from $7,434M in 2022 to $11,132M in 2023 (+49.7%). This indicates improved cost management and operating leverage in 2024, as the company generated much higher operating income with only a marginal increase in operating expenses. The operating income to revenue ratio improvement in 2024 reflects enhanced operational efficiency and scalability, likely driven by the growth in higher-margin Compute & Networking products and effective expense control. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate exhibited unusual fluctuations: it was very low at 1.90% in 2022, turned negative to -4.47% in 2023 (indicating a tax benefit or credit), and then rose to 12.00% in 2024. The negative tax expense of -$187M in 2023 versus positive tax expenses in 2022 ($189M) and 2024 ($4,058M) suggests the presence of non-recurring tax benefits or adjustments in 2023 that positively impacted net profit margin (16.19% in 2023). No explicit non-recurring items are detailed, but the tax anomalies and the large swings in profitability margins imply external or one-off factors influencing reported earnings. The substantial increase in net profit margin to 48.85% in 2024, alongside a normalized positive tax rate, indicates a return to more typical tax expense levels and strong underlying profitability. External factors such as geographic revenue shifts, especially the large U.S. market growth, may have influenced tax and profitability dynamics. |
