# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | NVIDIA's revenue showed a dramatic increase from $26,914 million in 2022 to $26,974 million in 2023, followed by a substantial surge to $60,922 million in 2024. Gross margin fluctuated, decreasing from 64.93% in 2022 to 56.93% in 2023, then sharply rising to 72.72% in 2024, indicating improved cost efficiency or pricing power in the latest year. Revenue by product reveals a significant shift: Compute & Networking revenue grew from $11,046 million in 2022 to $15,068 million in 2023 and then exploded to $47,405 million in 2024, while Graphics revenue declined from $15,868 million in 2022 to $11,906 million in 2023 and slightly increased to $13,517 million in 2024. Geographically, revenue from the United States increased markedly from $4,349 million in 2022 to $8,292 million in 2023 and then to $26,966 million in 2024, showing strong domestic growth. Taiwan and China revenues also grew but at a slower pace, with Taiwan at $8,544 million in 2022 rising to $13,405 million in 2024, and China from $7,111 million in 2022 to $10,306 million in 2024, indicating expanding international presence but with the U.S. as the primary growth driver. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin experienced a significant improvement from 37.31% in 2022 to 15.66% in 2023, then surged to 54.12% in 2024, reflecting enhanced operational leverage and profitability. Operating income rose from $10,041 million in 2022 to $4,224 million in 2023, then dramatically increased to $32,972 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and indicating better cost control and operational efficiency. Operating expenses increased moderately from $7,434 million in 2022 to $11,132 million in 2023 and slightly to $11,329 million in 2024, suggesting disciplined expense management despite the large revenue increase. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved substantially in 2024, highlighting effective cost management and scalability of operations. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted notably from 1.90% in 2022 to a negative rate of -4.47% in 2023, then normalized to 12.00% in 2024, which positively impacted net profit in 2023 by reducing tax expenses and contributed to a net profit margin of 16.19% that year. Income tax expense was negative in 2023 at -$187 million, indicating tax benefits or credits, while it was positive in 2022 and 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, so the tax rate fluctuations appear to be the primary external influence on profitability during this period. |
