# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | NVIDIA's revenue showed a dramatic increase from $26,914 million in 2022 to $26,974 million in 2023, followed by a substantial surge to $60,922 million in 2024. Despite the revenue growth, the gross margin fluctuated, decreasing from 64.93% in 2022 to 56.93% in 2023, then sharply rising to 72.72% in 2024, indicating improved cost efficiency or pricing power in the latest year. Revenue by product reveals a significant shift: Compute & Networking revenue grew from $11,046 million in 2022 to $15,068 million in 2023 and then exploded to $47,405 million in 2024, while Graphics revenue declined from $15,868 million in 2022 to $11,906 million in 2023 and then modestly increased to $13,517 million in 2024. Geographically, the United States revenue increased markedly from $4,349 million in 2022 to $8,292 million in 2023 and then to $26,966 million in 2024, showing strong domestic growth. Taiwan and China revenues also grew but at a slower pace, with Taiwan revenue peaking at $13,405 million in 2024 and China at $10,306 million, reflecting expanding international market penetration but with the U.S. as the dominant growth driver. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin experienced significant volatility, dropping from 37.31% in 2022 to 15.66% in 2023 before soaring to 54.12% in 2024, reflecting a major turnaround in operational profitability. Operating income followed a similar pattern, decreasing from $10,041 million in 2022 to $4,224 million in 2023, then increasing sharply to $32,972 million in 2024, which represents a much higher conversion of revenue into operating profit. Operating expenses remained relatively stable between 2023 and 2024 at around $11,300 million, slightly increasing from $7,434 million in 2022, indicating that cost management was effective relative to the large revenue increase. The substantial rise in operating income despite only a modest increase in operating expenses suggests improved operational leverage and efficiency in managing costs relative to revenue growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed notable fluctuations, being very low at 1.90% in 2022, turning negative to -4.47% in 2023, and then rising to 12.00% in 2024. The negative tax rate in 2023 likely contributed to a tax benefit that supported net profit despite lower operating income. Income tax expense shifted from a small positive $189 million in 2022 to a negative $187 million in 2023, then increased significantly to $4,058 million in 2024, impacting net profitability accordingly. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, so the tax rate changes appear to be the primary external factor influencing net profit margins during this period. |
