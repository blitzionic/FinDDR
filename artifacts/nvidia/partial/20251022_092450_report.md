## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, NVIDIA Corporation demonstrated a robust financial position with total assets increasing significantly to $65,728 million from $41,182 million in 2023, reflecting strong asset growth. Current assets nearly doubled to $44,345 million, enhancing liquidity, while non-current assets also grew moderately to $21,383 million. Total liabilities rose to $22,750 million from $19,081 million, but the increase in shareholders' equity was more pronounced, reaching $42,978 million compared to $22,101 million in 2023. This resulted in a lower debt to equity ratio of 52.93% from 86.34%, indicating a stronger capital structure with reduced leverage. The current ratio improved to 417.13% from 351.56%, signaling excellent short-term liquidity and ability to cover current obligations comfortably. Retained earnings surged to $29,817 million, supporting equity growth. Overall, NVIDIA's financial health in 2024 is characterized by substantial asset growth, improved liquidity, and a more conservative leverage profile, positioning the company well for future stability and growth. | In 2023, NVIDIA's total assets decreased to $41,182 million from $44,187 million in 2022, reflecting a contraction in overall asset base. Current assets declined significantly from $28,829 million to $23,073 million, while non-current assets increased from $15,358 million to $18,109 million, indicating a shift towards longer-term investments or capital assets. Total liabilities rose from $17,575 million to $19,081 million, driven primarily by an increase in current liabilities from $4,335 million to $6,563 million, despite a slight decrease in non-current liabilities from $13,240 million to $12,518 million. Shareholders' equity contracted from $26,612 million to $22,101 million, with retained earnings dropping notably from $16,235 million to $10,171 million, signaling reduced accumulated profits. The current ratio decreased substantially from 665.03% to 351.56%, indicating a decline in short-term liquidity though still above 1, suggesting adequate coverage of current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio increased from 66.04% to 86.34%, reflecting a higher leverage and greater reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Overall, NVIDIA's financial health in 2023 shows a modestly weaker liquidity position, increased leverage, and a smaller equity base, which may warrant monitoring but does not yet indicate critical distress. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | NVIDIA's profitability in 2024 showed remarkable improvement across all key metrics. Revenue more than doubled to $60,922 million from $26,974 million in 2023, driven primarily by a substantial increase in Compute & Networking revenue ($47,405 million vs. $15,068 million) and a moderate rise in Graphics revenue ($13,517 million vs. $11,906 million). Gross profit surged to $44,301 million, with gross margin expanding sharply to 72.72% from 56.93%, indicating enhanced cost efficiency or pricing power. Operating income rose dramatically to $32,972 million from $4,224 million, lifting the operating margin to 54.12% from 15.66%. Net profit soared to $29,760 million, with net margin reaching 48.85% compared to 16.19% in 2023, reflecting strong bottom-line growth and earnings quality. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) also improved significantly to 91.46% and 55.67%, respectively, demonstrating highly effective use of equity and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate normalized to 12.00% from a negative rate in 2023, reflecting a more typical tax expense. Overall, NVIDIA's 2024 profitability and earnings quality reflect exceptional growth, margin expansion, and efficient capital utilization. | NVIDIA's revenue in 2023 was essentially flat at $26,974 million compared to $26,914 million in 2022, showing no significant top-line growth. However, cost of goods sold increased sharply from $9,439 million to $11,618 million, causing gross profit to decline from $17,475 million to $15,356 million. Consequently, gross margin fell from 64.93% to 56.93%. Operating expenses surged from $7,434 million to $11,132 million, compressing operating income drastically from $10,041 million to $4,224 million and reducing operating margin from 37.31% to 15.66%. Net profit dropped by more than half from $9,752 million to $4,368 million, with net profit margin declining from 36.23% to 16.19%. Income tax expense turned negative to $(187) million from $189 million, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of (4.47%) compared to 1.90% previously, which may reflect tax credits or adjustments. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 17.93% and 10.23% respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and assets despite the margin compression. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2023 due to margin erosion and lower net income, though profitability remains positive. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved markedly in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased to $16,621 million but at a much lower rate than revenue, contributing to a higher gross margin. Operating expenses remained relatively stable at $11,329 million, only slightly up from $11,132 million in 2023, indicating effective cost control despite revenue growth. Asset turnover increased to 113.97% from 63.19%, showing improved utilization of assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations surged to $28,090 million from $5,641 million, reflecting strong cash generation capacity and operational cash flow health. Inventories increased marginally to $5,282 million, suggesting stable inventory management relative to sales growth. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supported by a current ratio of 417.13%. These factors collectively indicate NVIDIA enhanced its operational efficiency by controlling costs, optimizing asset use, and generating strong operational cash flows in 2024. | Operational efficiency in 2023 declined as evidenced by increased costs and reduced cash generation. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses both rose significantly, indicating challenges in cost control. Asset turnover was reported at 63.19%, suggesting relatively high revenue generation per unit of assets, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations decreased from $9,108 million in 2022 to $5,641 million in 2023, reflecting lower cash generation from core business activities. Inventories nearly doubled from $2,605 million to $5,159 million, which may indicate slower inventory turnover or buildup of stock. Working capital dynamics show current assets decreased while current liabilities increased, potentially tightening operational liquidity. Net cash from investing activities reversed from an outflow of $(9,830) million in 2022 to an inflow of $7,375 million in 2023, possibly due to asset sales or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities swung from an inflow of $1,865 million to a large outflow of $(11,617) million, indicating significant debt repayments or share repurchases. Overall, operational efficiency weakened with higher costs and lower operating cash flow, but improved investing cash flow and active financing management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | NVIDIA's financial risk profile in 2024 appears reduced compared to 2023. The debt to equity ratio declined to 52.93% from 86.34%, indicating lower financial leverage and reduced solvency risk. The current ratio of 417.13% suggests very strong liquidity, minimizing short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense remained low and stable at $257 million, with an extraordinary interest coverage ratio of 12,829.57%, reflecting ample earnings to cover interest obligations and minimal risk of default. The effective tax rate increased to 12.00% from a negative rate, representing a return to normal tax expense levels without unusual tax benefits or risks. No significant increases in non-current liabilities were observed, and the company maintained a strong equity base. Overall, NVIDIA's leverage, liquidity, and interest coverage metrics indicate low financial risk and strong capacity to meet obligations in 2024. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest increased leverage and liquidity risk. The debt to equity ratio rose from 66.04% to 86.34%, indicating higher financial leverage and potential vulnerability to interest and principal repayments. The current ratio declined markedly from 665.03% to 351.56%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity, though still well above 1. Interest expense increased slightly from $(236) million to $(262) million, while interest coverage ratio, though negative in both years, improved from (4254.66%) to (1612.21%), which may reflect accounting or reporting nuances but generally indicates strong ability to cover interest. The effective tax rate turned negative to (4.47%) from 1.90%, which could imply tax benefits or credits but also introduces variability in tax obligations. The significant increase in inventories and current liabilities may pose operational risks if not managed properly. No explicit early warning signs of distress are evident, but the combination of higher leverage, reduced liquidity, and margin compression warrants close monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, NVIDIA's future financial performance appears promising but will require monitoring of investment and cash flow trends. Net cash from investing activities was negative at $(10,566) million, indicating significant capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth but could pressure cash flow. Net cash from financing activities was negative $(13,633) million, reflecting possible debt repayments or share repurchases, which may reduce financial flexibility but strengthen the balance sheet. Dividends remained stable at approximately $(395) million, suggesting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue growth was driven heavily by Compute & Networking, which more than tripled, and geographic revenue expanded substantially across all regions, especially the United States. This diversification and segment growth bode well for sustained revenue expansion. The strong operational cash flow of $28,090 million supports cash flow sustainability despite heavy investing outflows. Overall, NVIDIA's investment in growth areas and strong cash generation capacity position it well for continued financial performance improvement, though capital deployment should be closely managed. | NVIDIA's future financial performance may be influenced by its investment and cash flow patterns observed in 2023. The company generated positive net cash from investing activities of $7,375 million, a reversal from the prior year's large outflow, suggesting asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures that could impact future growth capacity. Net cash from financing activities was a large outflow of $(11,617) million, indicating significant debt repayments or shareholder returns, which may reduce financial flexibility. Dividends remained stable at approximately $(398) million, reflecting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue by product shows a shift with Compute & Networking revenue increasing from $11,046 million to $15,068 million, while Graphics revenue declined from $15,868 million to $11,906 million, signaling a strategic pivot or changing market demand that could affect future segment profitability. Geographically, revenue from the United States nearly doubled from $4,349 million to $8,292 million, while revenues from Taiwan, China, and other countries declined, indicating a geographic concentration that may affect risk and growth prospects. Overall, NVIDIA's cash flow sustainability appears challenged by lower operating cash flow and high financing outflows, but investment activity and product/geographic shifts provide cues for potential future performance trends. |
