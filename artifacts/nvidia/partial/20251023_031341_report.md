Net profit declined from $9,752 million to $4,368 million, with net profit margin halving from 36.23% to 16.19%. Income tax expense shifted from a positive expense of $189 million to a negative expense of $(187) million, resulting in an effective tax rate moving from 1.90% to (4.47%), which may reflect tax benefits or credits. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 17.93% and 10.23%, respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and assets despite the decline in net income. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2023 due to margin compression and higher operating costs, though the company remained profitable with reasonable returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved markedly in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased from $11,618 million to $16,621 million, but at a much slower pace than revenue, contributing to a higher gross margin. Operating expenses remained nearly flat, increasing slightly from $11,132 million to $11,329 million despite the large revenue increase, indicating effective cost control. Asset turnover improved significantly from 63.19% to 113.97%, showing enhanced utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations surged from $5,641 million to $28,090 million, reflecting strong cash generation capacity aligned with profitability growth. Inventories increased marginally from $5,159 million to $5,282 million, suggesting stable inventory management relative to sales growth. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, NVIDIA's operational efficiency in 2024 is characterized by strong revenue generation from assets, disciplined expense management, and robust cash flow from operations. | Cost control deteriorated in 2023 as cost of goods sold increased from $9,439 million to $11,618 million, and operating expenses surged from $7,434 million to $11,132 million, outpacing flat revenue growth. Asset turnover was reported at 63.19%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased substantially from $9,108 million in 2022 to $5,641 million in 2023, reflecting lower cash generation from core business activities. Working capital was impacted by a rise in inventories from $2,605 million to $5,159 million and an increase in current liabilities, which may indicate inventory buildup or slower turnover. Net cash from investing activities decreased from $9,830 million to $7,375 million, suggesting reduced investment outflows. Net cash from financing activities increased markedly from $1,865 million to $11,617 million, possibly due to increased borrowing or equity transactions. The net increase in cash was modestly higher at $1,399 million compared to $1,143 million in 2022. Overall, operational efficiency declined due to higher costs and reduced operational cash flow, though asset utilization remained strong. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for NVIDIA in 2024 suggest a low risk profile. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 86.34% to 52.93%, indicating reduced leverage and a stronger equity cushion. The current ratio improved from 351.56% to 417.13%, reflecting excellent short-term liquidity. Interest expense remained stable and low at approximately $257 million, while interest coverage ratio increased dramatically from 1612.21% to 12,829.57%, demonstrating an exceptional ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate increased to 12.00% from a negative rate in 2023, indicating normalized tax expense but no apparent tax risk. No significant increases in non-current liabilities were observed, and the company maintained strong cash flow from operations. Overall, NVIDIA's financial risk in 2024 is minimal with strong liquidity, low leverage, and excellent interest coverage, providing early warning signals of financial stability. | Leverage increased in 2023 as evidenced by the rise in debt to equity ratio from 66.04% to 86.34%, indicating greater reliance on debt financing. Liquidity, while still strong, weakened as the current ratio dropped from 665.03% to 351.56%, reflecting a tighter short-term liquidity position. Interest expense increased slightly from $(236) million to $(262) million, but interest coverage ratio remained very high at 1612.21%, down from 4254.66% in 2022, indicating ample ability to cover interest payments despite the decline. The effective tax rate turned negative to (4.47%) from 1.90%, which may signal tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces some uncertainty in tax expense predictability. The significant increase in inventories and current liabilities could pose liquidity risks if not managed properly. Overall, financial risk has increased moderately due to higher leverage and reduced liquidity, but interest coverage remains robust, mitigating immediate solvency concerns. |
| Future financial performance projection | NVIDIA's future financial performance outlook appears strong based on 2024 data. The company invested $10,566 million in investing activities, up from $7,375 million in 2023, indicating ongoing capital expenditure or strategic investments to support growth. Net cash from operations of $28,090 million far exceeds investing and financing cash flows, suggesting sustainable cash flow generation. Financing activities increased to $13,633 million from $11,617 million, which may reflect debt repayment, share repurchases, or other capital management strategies. Dividends remained stable at approximately $395 million, indicating a consistent dividend policy. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the Compute & Networking segment, which more than tripled, signaling a key growth area. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional analysis. Overall, NVIDIA's strong cash flow, significant investment activity, and stable dividend payments suggest a positive outlook for sustained growth and shareholder returns. | NVIDIA's investment activity in 2023, as indicated by net cash from investing, decreased to $7,375 million from $9,830 million in 2022, suggesting a more cautious or selective capital expenditure approach. The substantial increase in net cash from financing activities to $11,617 million from $1,865 million may indicate new debt issuance or capital raising to support growth or liquidity needs. Dividend payments remained stable at approximately $398 million, reflecting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue by product shows a shift with Compute & Networking revenue increasing from $11,046 million to $15,068 million, while Graphics revenue declined from $15,868 million to $11,906 million, signaling a strategic pivot or changing market demand favoring Compute & Networking segments. Geographic revenue details for 2023 are unavailable, limiting regional growth insights. The sustainability of cash flows is challenged by reduced operational cash generation, but financing inflows may support ongoing operations and investments. Overall, NVIDIA appears to be investing selectively with a focus on growth in Compute & Networking, maintaining dividends, and leveraging financing to support future performance. |
