The current ratio improved from 351.56% to 417.13%, indicating enhanced liquidity and a strong ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 86.34% to 52.93%, suggesting a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, NVIDIA's financial health in 2024 is characterized by substantial asset growth, improved liquidity, and a strengthened equity base, supporting a solid capital structure. | In 2023, NVIDIA's total assets decreased to $41,182 million from $44,187 million in 2022, driven by a decline in current assets from $28,829 million to $23,073 million, partially offset by an increase in non-current assets from $15,358 million to $18,109 million. Total liabilities increased to $19,081 million from $17,575 million, with current liabilities rising significantly from $4,335 million to $6,563 million, while non-current liabilities slightly decreased from $13,240 million to $12,518 million. Shareholders' equity declined to $22,101 million from $26,612 million, reflecting reduced retained earnings ($10,171 million vs. $16,235 million). The current ratio dropped substantially from 665.03% to 351.56%, indicating a reduction in liquidity but still a strong current asset coverage of current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio increased from 66.04% to 86.34%, suggesting a higher leverage and a shift towards more debt financing relative to equity. Overall, NVIDIA's financial health in 2023 shows a contraction in asset base and equity, increased liabilities, and reduced liquidity, signaling a more leveraged capital structure and tighter short-term financial flexibility compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | NVIDIA's profitability in 2024 showed remarkable improvement compared to 2023. Revenue more than doubled from $26,974 million to $60,922 million, driven primarily by a substantial increase in Compute & Networking revenue (from $15,068 million to $47,405 million) and a moderate rise in Graphics revenue (from $11,906 million to $13,517 million). Gross profit surged from $15,356 million to $44,301 million, with gross margin expanding significantly from 56.93% to 72.72%, indicating improved cost efficiency or pricing power. Operating income increased dramatically from $4,224 million to $32,972 million, lifting the operating margin from 15.66% to 54.12%. Net profit rose from $4,368 million to $29,760 million, with net profit margin improving from 16.19% to 48.85%, reflecting strong earnings quality. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) also improved substantially, with ROE increasing from 17.93% to 91.46% and ROA from 10.23% to 55.67%, underscoring highly efficient use of equity and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate shifted from a negative rate (-4.47%) in 2023 to a positive 12.00% in 2024, indicating normalized tax expenses. Interest expense remained low and stable, supporting strong profitability. | NVIDIA's revenue in 2023 was essentially flat at $26,974 million compared to $26,914 million in 2022. However, profitability declined markedly: gross profit fell from $17,475 million to $15,356 million, with gross margin decreasing from 64.93% to 56.93%. Operating expenses rose sharply from $7,434 million to $11,132 million, causing operating income to drop from $10,041 million to $4,224 million and operating margin to fall from 37.31% to 15.66%. Net profit declined from $9,752 million to $4,368 million, with net profit margin halving from 36.23% to 16.19%. Income tax expense turned negative (-$187 million) resulting in an effective tax rate of -4.47%, compared to a positive tax expense and 1.90% rate in 2022, which may reflect tax benefits or credits. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 17.93% and 10.23%, respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and assets despite the declines. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2023 due to margin compression and higher operating costs, though the company remained profitable with positive returns on equity and assets. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved markedly in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased from $11,618 million to $16,621 million, but at a much lower rate than revenue, contributing to a higher gross margin. Operating expenses remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $11,132 million to $11,329 million, indicating effective cost control despite revenue growth. Asset turnover improved significantly from 63.19% to 113.97%, reflecting more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations surged from $5,641 million to $28,090 million, demonstrating strong cash generation capability. Inventories increased marginally from $5,159 million to $5,282 million, suggesting stable inventory management relative to sales growth. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, NVIDIA enhanced operational efficiency through strong revenue growth, controlled operating expenses, improved asset utilization, and robust cash flow from operations. | Operational efficiency deteriorated in 2023 as cost of goods sold increased from $9,439 million to $11,618 million despite flat revenue, reducing gross profit. Operating expenses surged by nearly 50% to $11,132 million, indicating less effective cost control. Asset turnover was reported at 63.19%, a high figure suggesting strong revenue generation relative to asset base, though this metric's scale appears unusually high and may reflect data specifics. Net cash from operations declined significantly from $9,108 million to $5,641 million, indicating reduced cash generation from core business activities. Inventories nearly doubled from $2,605 million to $5,159 million, which may signal slower inventory turnover or buildup of stock. Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) decreased from $24,494 million to $16,510 million, reflecting tighter short-term operational liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities reversed from a cash outflow of $9,830 million in 2022 to a cash inflow of $7,375 million in 2023, possibly from asset sales or reduced capital expenditures. Cash flow from financing activities shifted from a $1,865 million inflow to an $11,617 million outflow, indicating significant debt repayments or share repurchases. Overall, operational efficiency weakened with higher costs and lower operating cash flow, though asset utilization remained strong. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for 2024 suggest a reduced risk profile. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 86.34% to 52.93%, indicating lower financial leverage and reduced reliance on debt financing. The current ratio improved from 351.56% to 417.13%, reflecting strong liquidity and an enhanced ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest coverage ratio increased substantially from 1,612.21% to 12,829.57%, showing an exceptional capacity to cover interest expenses from operating income, which remained low and stable at around $257 million. The effective tax rate rose from a negative rate to 12.00%, representing a normalization of tax expenses but no indication of tax-related risk. No significant increase in non-current liabilities was observed, and the company maintained a strong equity base. Overall, NVIDIA's financial risk in 2024 appears low, with strong liquidity, reduced leverage, and excellent interest coverage mitigating financial distress risks. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show increased leverage and reduced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio rose from 66.04% to 86.34%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. The current ratio declined from 665.03% to 351.56%, reflecting a substantial decrease in short-term liquidity, though still well above 1. Interest expense increased slightly from $236 million to $262 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased from an extremely high 4254.66% to 1612.21%, still indicating strong ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate turned negative to -4.47% from 1.90%, which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets but could also indicate volatility in tax obligations. The significant increase in inventories and current liabilities could pose liquidity risks if inventory is not converted to cash timely. The large outflow in financing cash flow suggests repayment of debt or other financing activities that may constrain liquidity. Overall, while interest coverage remains strong, increased leverage, reduced liquidity, and tax rate volatility suggest elevated financial risk in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, NVIDIA's future financial performance appears promising but will require careful management of investment and financing activities. Net cash from investing activities turned negative at $(10,566) million in 2024 compared to a positive $7,375 million in 2023, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities remained negative at $(13,633) million, slightly higher than the prior year, reflecting continued outflows possibly related to debt repayments or share repurchases. Despite these outflows, net cash increased by $3,891 million, supporting cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments remained stable at approximately $(395) million, suggesting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the Compute & Networking segment, which more than tripled, signaling a strategic focus area. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional growth insights. Overall, NVIDIA's investment in growth initiatives and strong operational cash flow provide a solid foundation for sustained future performance, though monitoring capital expenditure efficiency and financing strategy will be critical. | NVIDIA's investing cash flow in 2023 showed a positive inflow of $7,375 million compared to a large outflow in 2022, indicating possible asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures, which may limit future growth investments. The significant outflow in financing cash flow of $11,617 million, contrasting with an inflow in 2022, suggests aggressive debt repayment or share repurchases, potentially reducing financial flexibility but lowering leverage. Dividends remained stable at approximately $398 million, indicating a consistent dividend policy. Revenue by product shows a shift with Compute & Networking revenue increasing from $11,046 million to $15,068 million, while Graphics revenue declined from $15,868 million to $11,906 million, signaling a strategic pivot or changing market demand that may influence future revenue streams. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional growth insights. The combination of reduced operating cash flow and changes in investing and financing activities suggests cautious cash flow sustainability. Overall, NVIDIA appears to be focusing on deleveraging and shifting product emphasis, which may impact future financial performance positively if the Compute & Networking segment grows, but the decline in Graphics revenue and reduced investment outlays could constrain growth potential. |
