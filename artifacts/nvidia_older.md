# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue remained nearly flat, increasing marginally by 0.22% from $26,914M to $26,974M. However, from 2023 to 2024, revenue surged dramatically by 125.8% to $60,922M. Gross profit decreased from $17,475M in 2022 to $15,356M in 2023 (-12.1%), then sharply increased to $44,301M in 2024 (+188.7%). Correspondingly, gross margin declined from 64.93% in 2022 to 56.93% in 2023, then rebounded strongly to 72.72% in 2024, indicating improved cost control or pricing power in 2024. By product, Compute & Networking revenue grew substantially from $11,046M in 2022 to $15,068M in 2023 (+36.4%) and then to $47,405M in 2024 (+214.7%), becoming the dominant revenue driver. Conversely, Graphics revenue declined from $15,868M in 2022 to $11,906M in 2023 (-25.0%) but rebounded to $13,517M in 2024 (+13.5%). This shift indicates a strategic or market-driven pivot towards Compute & Networking products. Geographically, the United States revenue grew sharply from $4,349M in 2022 to $8,292M in 2023 (+90.6%) and then to $26,966M in 2024 (+225.0%), becoming the largest market. Taiwan revenue decreased from $8,544M in 2022 to $6,986M in 2023 (-18.3%) but rose to $13,405M in 2024 (+91.8%). China (including Hong Kong) revenue declined steadily from $7,111M in 2022 to $5,785M in 2023 (-18.6%) and then to $10,306M in 2024 (+78.1%). Other countries showed moderate growth overall. The geographic distribution shows a strong shift towards the US market and a recovery in Taiwan and China in 2024 after declines in 2023. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income decreased sharply from $10,041M in 2022 to $4,224M in 2023 (-57.9%) despite flat revenue, reflecting margin pressure. However, in 2024, operating income surged to $32,972M (+680.5% vs 2023), outpacing revenue growth, indicating significant operating leverage. Operating expenses increased moderately from $7,434M in 2022 to $11,132M in 2023 (+49.7%) and slightly to $11,329M in 2024 (+1.8%), showing controlled expense growth relative to revenue. Operating margin declined from 37.31% in 2022 to 15.66% in 2023, then sharply improved to 54.12% in 2024, reflecting improved operational efficiency and cost management in 2024. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows a deterioration in 2023 but a strong recovery and efficiency gain in 2024, likely driven by higher gross margins and stable operating expenses. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 1.90% in 2022 to 4.47% in 2023 and then to 12.00% in 2024, indicating a rising tax burden as profitability improved. Income tax expense was negative in 2023 (-$187M), suggesting tax benefits or credits that year, but turned positive and substantial in 2024 ($4,058M). No explicit non-recurring items are reported in the data, but the negative tax expense in 2023 may reflect unusual tax events. External factors impacting profitability include the strong revenue and margin recovery in 2024, possibly due to market conditions favoring Compute & Networking products and geographic shifts towards the US market. The tax rate increase in 2024 reduces net profit margin slightly but overall net profit margin improved to 48.85% in 2024 from 16.19% in 2023, reflecting strong core profitability despite higher taxes. |
