# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Frasers Centrepoint Trust's revenue showed a slight decline from SGD 356,931 thousand in 2022 to SGD 369,723 thousand in 2023, before decreasing to SGD 351,733 thousand in 2024. Gross margin remained stable, with 72.45% in 2022, 71.83% in 2023, and 72.04% in 2024, indicating consistent cost control relative to revenue. By product/service, Causeway Point consistently contributed the highest revenue, increasing from SGD 89,007 thousand in 2022 to SGD 95,047 thousand in 2024. Other key properties such as Northpoint City North Wing and Tiong Bahru Plaza also showed steady performance, while Changi City Point's revenue dropped sharply from SGD 25,563 thousand in 2023 to SGD 2,666 thousand in 2024. All revenue was generated in Singapore across the three years. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 49.19% in 2022 to 40.32% in 2023 and further to 36.69% in 2024, reflecting a downward trend in operating efficiency. Operating income decreased from SGD 175,563 thousand in 2022 to SGD 149,069 thousand in 2023 and then to SGD 129,038 thousand in 2024, while revenue also declined, but at a slower rate. Operating expenses rose significantly from SGD 36,245 thousand in 2022 to SGD 138,288 thousand in 2023 and further to SGD 140,642 thousand in 2024, indicating increased cost pressures that have negatively impacted operating profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted from (3.03%) in 2022 to (0.12%) in 2023 and then to a positive 0.55% in 2024, indicating a normalization of tax expenses after prior years of tax credits or reversals. No non-recurring items are explicitly listed in the financial data. No external factors affecting profitability are explicitly mentioned in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Frasers Centrepoint Trust maintained a stable financial position. Total assets were SGD 6,378,871 thousand, marginally higher than 2023. Total liabilities decreased to SGD 2,186,193 thousand from SGD 2,212,947 thousand, indicating a reduction in obligations. Shareholders' equity increased to SGD 4,160,666 thousand, reflecting improved capital strength. The current ratio improved slightly to 45.79% (from 44.35%), suggesting a modest enhancement in liquidity, though the ratio remains low in absolute terms. The debt to equity ratio declined to 52.54% (from 55.70%), showing a more conservative capital structure with less reliance on debt. Overall, the trust's balance sheet in 2024 demonstrates incremental improvements in equity and reduced leverage, with stable asset levels and slightly better liquidity. | In 2023, Frasers Centrepoint Trust demonstrated a solid financial position. Total assets increased to SGD 6,375,182,000 from SGD 5,941,368,000 in 2022, reflecting asset growth. Total liabilities also rose to SGD 2,212,947,000 (from SGD 1,977,291,000), with non-current liabilities increasing more significantly than current liabilities. Shareholders' equity remained stable, rising slightly to SGD 3,973,235,000. The current ratio improved markedly to 44.35% from 9.92%, indicating a much stronger liquidity position and ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio increased to 55.70% (from 49.88%), suggesting a higher reliance on debt financing, but the capital structure remains equity-heavy. Overall, the trust's balance sheet shows increased scale, improved liquidity, and a moderate rise in leverage. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 softened compared to 2023. Revenue declined to SGD 351,733 thousand (from SGD 369,723 thousand), and gross profit also fell to SGD 253,386 thousand. Despite the revenue drop, the gross margin edged up to 72.04% (from 71.83%), indicating effective cost of goods sold management. However, operating expenses rose to SGD 140,642 thousand, leading to a lower operating income of SGD 129,038 thousand and a reduced operating margin of 36.69% (down from 40.32%). Net profit decreased to SGD 197,546 thousand, with the net profit margin slightly lower at 56.16%. Return on equity and assets both declined to 4.86% and 3.10%, respectively, reflecting weaker earnings generation from the asset and equity base. The effective tax rate turned positive at 0.55% (from -0.12%), but remains low. Overall, while cost control at the gross level was effective, higher operating expenses and lower revenue pressured overall profitability and returns. | Profitability remained robust in 2023. Revenue grew to SGD 369,723,000 (up from SGD 356,931,000), and net profit increased to SGD 211,954,000 (from SGD 207,279,000). Gross margin was stable at 71.83% (slightly down from 72.45%), while operating margin declined to 40.32% (from 49.19%), reflecting higher operating expenses (SGD 138,288,000 vs. SGD 36,245,000). Net profit margin remained high at 57.33% (down marginally from 58.07%). Return on equity (ROE) was 5.34% and return on assets (ROA) was 3.44%, both indicating healthy returns for the asset-heavy trust. The effective tax rate was negligible at (0.12%), similar to the prior year. Overall, earnings quality is strong, with high margins and stable profit growth, though operating efficiency was impacted by increased expenses. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 showed some deterioration. Asset turnover decreased to 5.52% (from 6.00%), indicating less effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations fell to SGD 215,667 thousand (from SGD 243,130 thousand), suggesting reduced cash-generating ability from core activities. Working capital improved slightly as current assets rose and current liabilities fell, but the current ratio remains below 1, indicating potential liquidity constraints. Cash flow from investing turned positive at SGD 45,193 thousand (from -SGD 356,931 thousand), implying reduced or more selective investment outflows. Net cash from financing was negative at -SGD 254,952 thousand (from +SGD 316,298 thousand), likely reflecting debt repayments or higher dividend payouts. The net increase in cash was minimal at SGD 5,908 thousand. Dividends paid increased to SGD 214,313 thousand, which, relative to net profit and cash from operations, suggests a high payout ratio. Overall, operational efficiency weakened, with lower asset utilization and operating cash flow, but investment outflows were curtailed. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed results. Cost of goods sold increased to SGD 104,137,000 (from SGD 98,334,000), and operating expenses rose sharply to SGD 138,288,000 (from SGD 36,245,000), which compressed operating income. Asset turnover was reported at 6.00%, indicating moderate asset utilization. Net cash from operations improved to SGD 243,130,000 (from SGD 233,584,000), supporting strong cash generation. Working capital improved, as current assets rose to SGD 219,656,000 and current liabilities decreased to SGD 495,228,000. Net cash from investing was negative at SGD (356,931,000), suggesting significant investment activity, while net cash from financing was positive at SGD 316,298,000, indicating new financing inflows. The net increase in cash was positive at SGD 202,497,000. Dividend payments remained stable at SGD 207,745,000. In summary, while cost control was challenged by higher expenses, cash flow from operations and working capital management were strong. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show both strengths and emerging concerns. Leverage decreased, as seen in the lower debt to equity ratio (52.54%), and total liabilities declined. Liquidity improved slightly, but the current ratio remains low at 45.79%, indicating ongoing short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense increased to SGD 80,821 thousand, and interest coverage fell to 159.66% (from 190.49%), signaling reduced ability to cover interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate rose to 0.55%, but remains low and unlikely to materially impact risk. The negative net cash from financing and high dividend payout could constrain future financial flexibility. No data on retained earnings or inventories is available. Overall, while leverage risk has moderated, liquidity and interest coverage warrant close monitoring. | Key financial risks in 2023 include increased leverage, as evidenced by the higher debt to equity ratio (55.70%) and a significant rise in interest expense (SGD 78,255,000 vs. SGD 46,832,000). Interest coverage declined to 190.49% (from 374.88%), indicating reduced but still adequate ability to service debt. The current ratio's sharp improvement to 44.35% mitigates short-term liquidity risk. The effective tax rate remained negligible, so tax risk is minimal. The substantial increase in operating expenses could signal cost management risks or one-off items. Overall, while leverage and interest costs have risen, liquidity is strong and coverage ratios remain healthy, but continued monitoring of expense growth and debt servicing is warranted. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Frasers Centrepoint Trust's future performance will depend on its ability to stabilize revenue and manage costs. The positive net cash from investing in 2024 suggests a pause or reduction in capital expenditures, which may limit future growth but supports near-term cash flow. The high dividend payout (SGD 214,313 thousand) relative to net profit and operating cash flow raises questions about sustainability if earnings do not recover. Revenue by property shows growth in key assets like Causeway Point and Northpoint City North Wing, but a sharp decline at Changi City Point (SGD 2,666 thousand from SGD 25,563 thousand) may signal asset-specific challenges. All revenue remains Singapore-based, so geographic diversification is absent. The trust's ability to maintain or grow distributions will depend on reversing the revenue decline, controlling operating expenses, and managing liquidity and leverage. Without new investment or geographic expansion, future growth may be limited, and maintaining high dividends could pressure cash reserves if profitability does not improve. | Looking ahead, Frasers Centrepoint Trust's significant investment outflows (net cash from investing: SGD (356,931,000)) and strong financing inflows (SGD 316,298,000) suggest active portfolio expansion or asset enhancement, which could drive future revenue and asset growth. Cash flow from operations remains robust, supporting ongoing dividend payments (SGD 207,745,000), indicating a sustainable dividend policy. Revenue growth across all major properties, especially Causeway Point and Northpoint City North Wing, points to continued strength in core assets. The trust remains focused on Singapore, with all reported revenue from this market. Provided cost escalation is controlled and leverage is managed, the trust is well-positioned for stable to improving financial performance in the near term. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT) faces market risks from heightened market volatility driven by global inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and stress in some markets/sectors, which may constrain credit markets, cause negative capital value movements, and increase property market volatility. Consumer and investor behavior can change rapidly during such volatility, impacting investment and decision-making. The domestic retail market is affected by demographic shifts such as an ageing population and increased housing supply, as well as government policy shifts targeting elderly, families, and lower-income households, influencing shopper preferences and retail space demand. E-commerce growth also affects retailers' requirements. The Manager actively monitors macroeconomic trends, policies, regulatory changes, and retail market trends, and strengthens competitiveness through active lease management and asset enhancement. The retail sector outlook is cautiously optimistic with potential growth in suburban retail due to improved transport connectivity and population growth. Retailers must adapt to changing consumer behavior, including sustainability and wellness trends, and leverage experiential retail and pop-ups to attract foot traffic.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Frasers Centrepoint Trust faces economic challenges including global inflationary pressures leading to higher interest rates, which increase operating expenses and borrowing costs. The potential for constrained credit markets and negative capital value movements in property markets due to heightened market volatility poses risks. Inflationary pressures and monetary policy constraints continue to challenge sustained growth and stability, despite a cautiously optimistic medium-term outlook for Singapore's economy. The domestic retail market is affected by demographic shifts such as a rapidly ageing population and increased housing supply, influencing shopper preferences and retail space demand. Rising operational costs are also driven by wage increases under the Progressive Wage Model and inflation. Additionally, the retail sector faces challenges from changing consumer behavior, increased competition from e-commerce, and a slight contraction in retail sales projected at 1.4% year-on-year in 2024. High interest rates and cost of capital impact profitability and distributable income, with interest rate risk actively managed but remaining a key factor. Climate change and sustainability risks, including rising operating costs from physical and transition risks, add to economic uncertainties. The potential impact of the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System on retail sales due to cross-border spending is also noted as a risk. Overall, economic uncertainties, inflation, interest rate environment, demographic changes, and evolving consumer behavior present ongoing challenges to revenue and profitability. | Frasers Centrepoint Trust faces several economic challenges and uncertainties as outlined in the 2023 annual report. Globally, the IMF forecasts a slowdown in GDP growth to 2.9% in 2024 with inflation declining to 5.8%, influenced by ongoing monetary tightening. The US Federal Reserve's prior rate hikes and the cautious stance of central banks, including MAS in Singapore, create uncertainty around future interest rate movements, which could either sharply contract global consumption or worsen the cost of living, both negatively impacting Singapore's economy. China’s economic and demographic challenges, including a declining population, rising youth unemployment, and a troubled real estate market, pose risks to Singapore’s export output and tourism recovery. Domestically, Singapore’s GDP growth is expected to be modest, with MTI forecasting 0.5%-1.5% growth in 2023, reflecting exposure to global economic volatility. Inflation remains elevated at around 5.1% year-on-year as of September 2023, with rising prices in food, beverage services, and transport. The cost of living support packages by the government aim to mitigate these pressures, but high operating expenses, including energy prices and borrowing costs (with average borrowing costs expected above 4%), continue to challenge profitability. Additionally, global geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East, contribute to commodity price inflation risks. The retail sector faces uncertainties from slower retail sales growth due to softer economic outlook and tourism recovery, particularly from China. The Trust also contends with inflationary pressures, rising business costs, and a limited pool of prospective tenants amid changing retail market trends. Climate change and regulatory requirements for sustainability add further cost pressures. Overall, these macroeconomic factors, cost pressures, and market conditions create a challenging environment that could impact revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | Frasers Centrepoint Trust faces competitive pressures from both established retail players and new market entrants, including international brands expanding into suburban malls. The rise of e-commerce has altered consumer shopping habits, leading to declines in traditional department store sales and increased demand for omnichannel retailing. Retailers are adapting by integrating technology such as self-ordering kiosks, QR code menus, and experimenting with unmanned stores to reduce operational costs and enhance customer experience. The retail landscape demands innovation, experiential retail, and pop-up stores to attract foot traffic and differentiate offerings. There is also a growing emphasis on sustainability and wellness retail, reflecting changing consumer priorities. The suburban retail market remains resilient but experiences slight occupancy contractions due to new supply. FCT actively strengthens competitiveness through active lease management, asset enhancement initiatives, and tenant engagement. The emergence of new retail concepts and the need to cater to diverse consumer segments, including the ageing population, require continuous adaptation. Additionally, the potential loss of sales to Johor Bahru due to improved cross-border connectivity presents competitive challenges. Overall, FCT operates in a dynamic and evolving retail environment with competitive threats from digital disruption, changing consumer preferences, and new entrants necessitating strategic responses to maintain market position. | Frasers Centrepoint Trust encounters competitive pressures from established players and new market entrants as detailed in the 2023 report. The retail property market is evolving with increasing importance of omnichannel retailing, requiring malls to enhance convenience, accessibility, and experiential offerings to attract consumers. The emergence of digital native brands and new entrants such as Luckin Coffee, Kave Home, and Neiwai introduces technological disruption and intensifies competition for tenant mix and shopper engagement. The suburban retail sector, where FCT has significant presence, benefits from changing consumer movement patterns favoring local malls, but competition remains strong with other major owners like CapitaLand and Link REIT expanding their portfolios. The retail market also faces challenges from fluctuating occupancy rates and rental declines, particularly in central areas, although suburban malls show resilience. Rising operating and manpower costs, along with the need for innovation and technology adoption to improve operational efficiency, are critical to maintaining competitiveness. Additionally, sustainability trends and increasing shopper awareness on environmental issues require FCT to adapt its offerings and engage tenants and shoppers in responsible consumption, adding complexity to competitive dynamics. The Trust’s market share is influenced by divestments and acquisitions within the industry, with shifts in ownership among top shopping centre owners affecting market positioning. Overall, FCT must navigate a competitive landscape marked by evolving consumer preferences, technological disruption, and industry consolidation to sustain its market position. |

| New product launches, emphasizing the company's commitment to continuously introducing differentiated products | In 2024, Frasers Centrepoint Trust demonstrated its commitment to continuously introducing differentiated retail experiences through significant asset enhancement initiatives and tenant mix innovations. Notably, the Tampines 1 AEI, completed on schedule in August 2024 with a capital expenditure of $38 million, rejuvenated the mall by adding over 9,000 square feet of net lettable space, reconfiguring floor layouts, and refreshing common areas. This AEI introduced 68 new-to-mall retail and food & beverage concepts, including popular brands such as Sinpopo, Tiong Bahru Bakery, Hawkers' Street, and Love, Bonito, enhancing the mall's appeal and shopper experience. The AEI achieved a return on investment exceeding the target of 8%, with strong recovery in foot traffic and tenant sales. Additionally, FCT's omnichannel retail approach, supported by the Frasers Experience (FRx) loyalty program, integrates digital engagement with physical retail, promoting convenience through click-and-collect services and data-driven tenant assortment decisions. The inclusion of experiential retail and pop-up stores, such as seasonal attractions and Instagram-worthy event spaces, further differentiates FCT's retail offerings, driving footfall increases of 10-25%. These initiatives underscore FCT's strategy to innovate retail environments, enhance customer engagement, and maintain competitive differentiation in the evolving retail landscape. | N/A |
