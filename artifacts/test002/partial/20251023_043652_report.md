# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | OUE Real Estate Investment Trust's revenue increased steadily from SGD 241,507 thousand in 2022 to SGD 285,055 thousand in 2023, and further to SGD 295,521 thousand in 2024. Gross margin, however, declined from 81.54% in 2022 to 82.43% in 2023, then dropped to 79.19% in 2024, indicating rising direct costs relative to revenue. By product/service, commercial revenue grew from SGD 173,137 thousand in 2022 to SGD 189,608 thousand in 2024, while hospitality revenue rose significantly from SGD 68,370 thousand in 2022 to SGD 105,913 thousand in 2024. Geographically, Singapore remained the dominant market, with revenue increasing from SGD 214,436 thousand in 2022 to SGD 273,266 thousand in 2024, while China revenue declined from SGD 27,071 thousand in 2022 to SGD 22,255 thousand in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin decreased from 69.66% in 2022 to 57.61% in 2023 and further to 55.71% in 2024, reflecting declining operating efficiency. Operating income remained relatively stable at SGD 168,239 thousand in 2022, SGD 164,225 thousand in 2023, and SGD 164,635 thousand in 2024, despite rising revenue, indicating that operating expenses increased disproportionately. Operating expenses surged from SGD 24,676 thousand in 2022 to over SGD 70,000 thousand in both 2023 and 2024, suggesting significant cost pressures and challenges in cost management. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted dramatically from 3.74% in 2022 to 1.19% in 2023, then to a negative (25.29%) in 2024, which likely contributed to the net loss of SGD (68,321) thousand in 2024 despite positive operating income. No explicit non-recurring items are listed in the provided data. No external factors affecting profitability are explicitly mentioned in the financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, OUE Real Estate Investment Trust's total assets stood at SGD 5,939,901 thousand, a marginal increase from 2023. Current assets rose significantly to SGD 386,202 thousand (from SGD 259,114 thousand), while non-current assets declined to SGD 5,553,699 thousand. Total liabilities increased to SGD 2,242,998 thousand, with current liabilities rising to SGD 271,157 thousand and non-current liabilities slightly decreasing. Shareholders' equity declined to SGD 3,187,301 thousand, reflecting a reduction in net worth. The current ratio improved to 142.43% (from 134.91%), indicating stronger short-term liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio increased to 70.37% (from 65.90%), suggesting a higher reliance on debt financing. Overall, the capital structure is more leveraged, and while liquidity has improved, the decline in equity and increased liabilities warrant close monitoring. | In 2023, OUE Real Estate Investment Trust demonstrated a substantial increase in total assets, rising to SGD 5,930,260 thousand from SGD 3,356,222 thousand in 2022, indicating significant asset growth. Total liabilities also increased markedly to SGD 2,182,230 thousand (from SGD 116,149 thousand), with non-current liabilities forming the majority (SGD 1,990,168 thousand). Shareholders' equity improved slightly to SGD 3,311,192 thousand (from SGD 3,240,073 thousand), reflecting retained value for shareholders. The current ratio for 2023 is 134.91%, suggesting adequate short-term liquidity to cover current obligations. However, the debt to equity ratio surged to 65.90% from 3.58%, indicating a much higher reliance on debt financing and a more leveraged capital structure. Overall, while the trust's asset base and equity have grown, the sharp increase in liabilities and leverage warrants close monitoring. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased to SGD 295,521 thousand in 2024, up from SGD 285,055 thousand, with both commercial and hospitality segments contributing to the growth. However, cost of goods sold rose sharply, resulting in a slight decrease in gross profit to SGD 234,035 thousand. Gross margin declined to 79.19% (from 82.43%), and operating margin also fell to 55.71%. Most notably, net profit turned negative at (SGD 68,321 thousand), compared to a positive SGD 200,109 thousand in 2023, driving the net profit margin to (23.12%) from 70.20%. Return on equity and return on assets both turned negative, at (2.10%) and (1.15%) respectively, indicating a significant deterioration in earnings quality. The effective tax rate also swung sharply negative, suggesting the presence of non-recurring or exceptional items impacting net results. | Profitability in 2023 remained robust, with revenue increasing to SGD 285,055 thousand (up from SGD 241,507 thousand in 2022). Gross profit also rose to SGD 234,967 thousand. The gross margin improved slightly to 82.43% (from 81.54%), indicating strong cost control at the gross level. However, operating expenses increased significantly to SGD 70,742 thousand (from SGD 24,676 thousand), resulting in a lower operating income of SGD 164,225 thousand and a reduced operating margin of 57.61% (down from 69.66%). Net profit declined to SGD 200,109 thousand (from SGD 273,374 thousand), and the net profit margin fell to 70.20% (from 113.20%), reflecting the impact of higher operating and interest expenses. Return on equity (6.11%) and return on assets (4.31%) for 2023 indicate moderate profitability relative to the asset and equity base. The effective tax rate decreased to 1.19%, supporting net earnings. Overall, while top-line growth was strong, bottom-line profitability was pressured by higher expenses. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency weakened in 2024. Asset turnover declined to 4.98% (from 6.14%), indicating less effective use of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses were slightly reduced to SGD 69,400 thousand, but this was offset by a substantial increase in cost of goods sold. Net cash from operations decreased to SGD 198,162 thousand, reflecting lower cash generation from core activities. Working capital improved, as evidenced by the higher current ratio, but the overall cash flow from operations was insufficient to offset the negative net profit. Despite this, net cash from investing surged to SGD 285,462 thousand, and net cash from financing outflows decreased, resulting in a strong net increase in cash of SGD 307,936 thousand. Dividend payments were slightly reduced, but still substantial at SGD 108,211 thousand. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed results. Asset turnover was 6.14, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased to SGD 213,387 thousand (from SGD 183,534 thousand), reflecting improved cash-generating ability. Net cash from investing turned positive at SGD 1,458 thousand (from negative SGD 30,848 thousand), suggesting reduced or more efficient investment outflows. However, net cash from financing was more negative at SGD (208,944) thousand, indicating higher repayments or distributions. Dividends paid decreased to SGD (114,432) thousand (from SGD 133,622 thousand), possibly reflecting a more conservative payout. The net increase in cash was positive at SGD 5,901 thousand, reversing the prior year's decrease. Despite higher operating expenses, the trust maintained positive operational cash flow and improved working capital, as evidenced by the current ratio above 100%. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 point to increased leverage and potential stress. The debt to equity ratio rose to 70.37%, and total liabilities increased. Interest expense also increased, while interest coverage slightly declined to 141.06%. The negative net profit and negative returns on equity and assets are early warning signs of financial distress. The effective tax rate turned sharply negative, which may indicate one-off tax adjustments or losses. Liquidity risk appears contained in the short term due to the improved current ratio, but the overall increase in leverage and negative profitability heighten longer-term financial risk. | Key financial risks in 2023 include a significant increase in leverage, as shown by the debt to equity ratio rising to 65.90% (from 3.58%). Interest expense also increased to SGD 114,847 thousand, and interest coverage declined to 142.99% (from 201.67%), indicating reduced but still adequate ability to service debt. The current ratio of 134.91% suggests sufficient liquidity, but the sharp rise in both current and non-current liabilities could pressure future liquidity if not managed. The effective tax rate dropped to 1.19%, which may not be sustainable and could increase in future periods. The higher operating expenses and increased financing outflows are early warning signs that cost and debt management should be prioritized to mitigate financial risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the significant increase in net cash from investing suggests major investment activity, which could support future growth if these investments yield returns. However, the sustainability of cash flows is questionable given the negative net profit and declining operational cash generation. Dividend payments remain high relative to net cash from operations, potentially pressuring liquidity if negative earnings persist. Revenue growth is primarily driven by the Singapore segment, with China revenue slightly declining, indicating geographic concentration risk. The hospitality segment showed stronger growth than commercial, which may influence future segment strategies. Overall, unless profitability recovers, continued high leverage and dividend payouts could constrain future financial flexibility. | Looking ahead, the trust's strong asset growth and increased revenue base provide a solid foundation for future performance. The positive net cash from investing in 2023 suggests a pause or completion of major investment activities, which could stabilize future cash flows. However, the higher leverage and increased interest expense may constrain future profitability and dividend capacity. The reduction in dividends paid in 2023 may signal a more cautious approach to distributions. Segment-wise, commercial revenue remains the largest contributor, but hospitality showed notable growth (SGD 97,253 thousand in 2023 vs. SGD 68,370 thousand in 2022), indicating potential for further expansion. Geographically, Singapore remains the dominant market, with revenue increasing to SGD 261,885 thousand, while China revenue declined. Sustained operational cash flow and asset utilization will be critical for supporting ongoing obligations and potential growth, but careful management of leverage and expenses will be essential to maintain financial health. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | OUE REIT operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on income-producing real estate primarily for commercial (office and retail) and hospitality purposes, with all core assets located in Singapore following the divestment of its China property in 2024. The primary business model is based on property rental income, with 90% of revenue derived from long commercial leases and minimum rent under master lease agreements (MLA). Revenue streams include: (i) rental income from investment properties (recognized on a straight-line basis over lease terms, with both fixed and variable rent components), (ii) service fee income from property servicing and maintenance, (iii) car park income (season and hourly parking), and (iv) dividend income from subsidiaries. The REIT also receives management, property, and lease management fees from its properties.

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | OUE REIT faces market risks including macro-economic and market risk from economic instability or downturns in global financial markets, which may adversely impact operations. Competition risk arises from increased competition within the industry, especially in the hospitality sector, and new market entrants leading to potential loss of market share. Heightened market volatility due to global inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and stress in some markets/sectors increases the potential for constrained credit markets, negative capital value movements, and enhanced property market volatility. Demand volatility is influenced by evolving consumer preferences and shopping behaviors, with challenges such as e-commerce, manpower shortages, and higher operating costs affecting retail operations. Industry trends include the recovery of tourism and back-to-office momentum boosting retail and office demand, while supply-side factors such as limited new retail and office supply support rental growth. External market factors include geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and uneven economic recovery in China. The Manager mitigates these risks by actively assessing and monitoring macro-market outlooks, conducting due diligence for acquisitions/divestments, proactive tenant engagement, active property management, customized leasing strategies, asset enhancement initiatives, and improving environmental credentials of properties to future-proof asset performance. | OUE REIT faces market risks from heightened global inflationary pressures leading to higher interest rates, potential constrained credit markets, negative capital value movements, and enhanced volatility in property markets. Consumer and investor behavior can change rapidly during such volatility. The Shanghai leasing market remains challenging due to peak supply, weak demand, and competition from decentralised business districts. Softening global leasing demand and new supply may present headwinds for Singapore's office market, though flight-to-quality and flight-to-green trends support demand. Retail faces challenges from e-commerce growth, manpower shortages, elevated operating expenses, and economic sluggishness, but tourism recovery and limited supply support rents and occupancy. The real estate sector is also susceptible to physical risks from climate change (droughts, floods, heatwaves, rising sea levels) and transition risks from more stringent environmental regulations and shifting consumer preferences towards sustainability. The Manager monitors market trends closely and adopts disciplined investment and leasing strategies to mitigate these risks. |

# Section 6: Future Outlook

## S6.1: Strategic Direction

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mergers and Acquisition | OUE REIT's M&A strategy focuses on disciplined investment management with a clear emphasis on gateway cities including Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and London. The REIT strategically realigned its portfolio in December 2024 by divesting Lippo Plaza in Shanghai for RMB 1,916,925,000 (approximately S$357.4 million) due to diminishing leasehold tenure and market oversupply. There are no plans to expand footprint in China. Instead, OUE REIT is actively exploring accretive acquisition opportunities in developed markets such as Australia (Sydney) and Japan (Tokyo), which offer strong real estate fundamentals and growth potential. Elevated interest rates have made near-term acquisitions challenging, but valuation adjustments in target markets position OUE REIT to capitalize on future opportunities. The REIT also established a S$2 billion Euro Medium Term Note Programme in October 2024 to diversify funding sources and optimize capital structure, supporting future acquisition and growth initiatives. | OUE REIT plans to explore overseas investment opportunities in key gateway cities including Australia (Sydney and Melbourne), Hong Kong, Japan, and the UK (London), while maintaining Singapore as its primary market. The Manager will diligently examine each opportunity using a disciplined investment review process to ensure prudent capital deployment for long-term returns. The strategy includes progressively increasing the revenue contribution from the hospitality segment to build a balanced portfolio across commercial and hospitality sectors. The Manager also seeks accretive asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) to boost organic growth and improve asset quality and marketability. In 2023, a S$14 million AEI was completed at Crowne Plaza Changi Airport. The Manager is open to portfolio reconstitution opportunities and aims to expand into higher-yielding segments and other target markets.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | OUE REIT faces several economic challenges and uncertainties including global inflationary pressures leading to higher interest rates, constrained credit markets, and volatility in property markets. The company notes potential escalations in geopolitical and trade tensions, a subdued recovery in China's economy, and risks to global growth. Singapore's GDP growth is projected to slow to between 1% and 3% in 2025 from 4.0% in 2024. Inflationary pressures, potential higher tariffs, and tax reductions remain key risks to the global economy. Elevated borrowing costs and cautious occupier sentiment have influenced leasing activities, particularly in the office market. The company also highlights the impact of high domestic costs and ongoing economic uncertainties. Despite some easing of US monetary policy, the trajectory of rate cuts is expected to moderate. The company manages interest rate risk through hedging and fixed rate borrowings but remains exposed to interest rate volatility. The retail sector faces challenges from e-commerce, manpower shortages, and higher operating costs. Consumer behavior shifts, such as increased online sales and changing spending patterns, add complexity. The company also notes risks from potential economic downturns and market instability that could adversely impact operations and valuations. Overall, OUE REIT emphasizes the need for prudent capital management, monitoring of market conditions, and strategic asset optimization to mitigate these economic challenges. | OUE REIT faces significant economic challenges including global inflationary pressures leading to higher interest rates, which have increased market volatility and constrained credit markets. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain with slow economic growth, elevated interest rates, and geopolitical tensions impacting business and consumer sentiment. Singapore's GDP growth moderated to 1.1% in 2023 with ongoing inflationary pressures, including a GST hike to 9% in 2024, contributing to higher domestic costs. The office and retail markets face headwinds from weaker leasing demand, high material and labor costs, and a cautious economic outlook. In Shanghai, slower economic recovery and a sluggish property market add to uncertainties. The high interest rate environment persists with unclear timelines for rate cuts, necessitating prudent capital and risk management. Additionally, shifts in consumer behavior, such as increased e-commerce adoption and changing retail spending patterns, require adaptation. These factors collectively pose risks to revenue, profitability, and asset valuations in the short to medium term. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | OUE REIT acknowledges competitive pressures primarily from increased competition within the hospitality sector and the entry of new market players. The company faces competition from both established industry players and new entrants, which could lead to loss of market share. To address these pressures, OUE REIT employs proactive tenant engagement, active property management, and customized leasing strategies tailored to occupiers' evolving needs. The company also identifies asset enhancement initiatives and improving environmental credentials of properties as key measures to maintain competitiveness. The evolving consumer preferences towards experiential travel, health and wellness, and sustainability require OUE REIT to continuously refresh tenant mix and introduce innovative brands and concepts. The company also notes the importance of flight-to-quality and flight-to-green trends in office spaces, with tenants preferring high-quality, sustainable offices, which intensifies competition among landlords. Technological disruption is addressed through leveraging advanced technologies for sales strategies and market opportunity identification. Overall, OUE REIT recognizes the dynamic industry landscape and adopts a disciplined investment management strategy to sustain its market position amid competitive threats and changing industry dynamics. | OUE REIT encounters competitive pressures from both established players and new market dynamics. In Shanghai, fierce competition arises from decentralised business districts offering cost-efficient alternatives, leading to tenant relocations and increased vacancy rates in prime areas. Landlords are compelled to offer longer rent-free periods, flexible lease terms, and enhanced tenant incentives to maintain occupancy. In Singapore, the office market is influenced by flight-to-quality and flight-to-green trends, prompting landlords to undertake asset enhancement initiatives to remain competitive. The retail sector faces intense competition driven by evolving consumer preferences, the rise of omnichannel and click-and-collect services, and the need for experiential retail to attract footfall. Technological disruption, including AI and digital innovations, is reshaping tenant and consumer expectations, requiring landlords to adopt smart solutions and sustainability practices. Additionally, new supply in office and retail spaces increases market competition, while the emergence of flexible/hybrid working arrangements and office decentralisation challenge traditional office demand. These competitive dynamics necessitate strategic leasing, tenant engagement, and continuous innovation to sustain market position. |

While it discusses market trends such as the rise in pet-friendly retail spaces and health and wellness consumer preferences, as well as new retail and hospitality developments in Singapore, there is no specific information on new products released, product innovations, or technology features introduced by OUE REIT. The focus remains on portfolio management, sustainability integration, tenant engagement activities, and asset enhancement initiatives rather than launching new products. | In 2023, OUE REIT demonstrated commitment to product innovation primarily through asset enhancement initiatives and new workspace concepts. Hilton Singapore Orchard became the first hotel in Singapore with an in-house water purification and bottling system, significantly reducing plastic waste by eliminating up to 100,000 single-use water bottles monthly. The hotel also expanded its MICE facilities with 16 modern meeting spaces totaling 2,400 square meters, catering to the growing business and luxury leisure segments. Crowne Plaza Changi Airport added a 352-square meter function room with state-of-the-art audiovisual technology to complement existing event spaces. At OUE Downtown Office, new fit-out workspaces adopting open floor concepts were introduced to foster connectivity and collaboration among tenants, receiving positive tenant feedback. These initiatives reflect OUE REIT's strategy to continuously introduce differentiated, sustainable, and tenant-centric offerings to enhance market competitiveness and customer experience. |
