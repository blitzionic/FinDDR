# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Food Empire Holdings Limited's revenue increased steadily from USD 398,362 thousand in 2022 to USD 425,715 thousand in 2023, and further to USD 476,347 thousand in 2024. Gross profit also rose from USD 118,843 thousand in 2022 to USD 141,451 thousand in 2023 and USD 144,392 thousand in 2024. However, gross margin improved from 29.83% in 2022 to 33.23% in 2023, but declined to 30.31% in 2024, indicating rising direct costs in the latest year. By product, Beverages remained the dominant segment, growing from USD 299,315 thousand in 2022 to USD 324,366 thousand in 2023 and USD 356,388 thousand in 2024. Ingredients revenue also increased from USD 63,124 thousand in 2022 to USD 86,490 thousand in 2024. Regionally, Russia's revenue declined from USD 148,384 thousand in 2022 to USD 141,735 thousand in 2024, while South-East Asia and Ukraine, Kazakhstan and CIS markets showed strong growth, with South-East Asia rising from USD 92,718 thousand in 2022 to USD 129,351 thousand in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 13.23% in 2022 to 16.66% in 2023, but fell to 13.28% in 2024. Operating income increased from USD 52,717 thousand in 2022 to USD 70,933 thousand in 2023, before dropping to USD 63,281 thousand in 2024, despite revenue growth. Operating expenses rose each year, from USD 66,126 thousand in 2022 to USD 70,518 thousand in 2023 and USD 81,111 thousand in 2024, outpacing revenue growth in the latest year and pressuring margins. This suggests that while the company managed costs well in 2023, cost management weakened in 2024, as both cost of goods sold and operating expenses increased faster than revenue. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 15.05% in 2022 to 22.12% in 2023, before moderating to 18.90% in 2024. This higher tax burden in 2023 and 2024 contributed to lower net profit margins, with net profit declining from USD 60,068 thousand in 2022 to USD 56,464 thousand in 2023 and USD 52,869 thousand in 2024, despite higher revenues. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors are listed in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Food Empire Holdings Limited demonstrated a solid asset base with total assets rising to USD 460,081 thousand from USD 402,905 thousand in 2023. Current assets increased to USD 305,700 thousand, outpacing the growth in current liabilities (USD 99,343 thousand), resulting in a strong current ratio of 307.72%, though slightly lower than 2023's 336.17%. Total liabilities grew significantly to USD 163,993 thousand (from USD 108,412 thousand), driven by increases in both current and non-current liabilities. Shareholders' equity remained stable at USD 293,820 thousand, with retained earnings increasing to USD 298,426 thousand. The debt to equity ratio rose to 55.81% from 36.67%, indicating a higher reliance on debt financing. Overall, the company maintains robust liquidity and a healthy capital structure, but the increased leverage warrants monitoring. | In 2023, Food Empire Holdings Limited demonstrated a robust financial position. Total assets increased to USD 402,905 thousand from USD 381,495 thousand in 2022, while total liabilities rose modestly to USD 108,412 thousand from USD 105,896 thousand. Shareholders' equity strengthened to USD 295,642 thousand, up from USD 276,704 thousand, reflecting retained earnings growth to USD 285,056 thousand. The current ratio remained very strong at 336.17%, indicating ample liquidity to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio improved to 36.67% from 38.27%, suggesting a slightly more conservative capital structure. Overall, the company maintained high liquidity and a solid equity base, with a prudent balance between debt and equity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 showed mixed signals. Revenue grew by 11.9% to USD 476,347 thousand, but gross profit increased only marginally to USD 144,392 thousand due to a higher cost of goods sold. Gross margin declined to 30.31% from 33.23%, and operating margin fell to 13.28% from 16.66%, reflecting increased operating expenses. Net profit decreased to USD 52,869 thousand (from USD 56,464 thousand), with net profit margin dropping to 11.10%. Return on equity and return on assets also declined to 17.94% and 12.25%, respectively. The effective tax rate improved to 18.90% from 22.12%, partially offsetting lower pre-tax income. Overall, while top-line growth was strong, margin compression and lower returns indicate some pressure on earnings quality. | Profitability in 2023 showed mixed signals. Revenue grew to USD 425,715 thousand (up from USD 398,362 thousand), and gross profit increased to USD 141,451 thousand. Both gross margin (33.23%) and operating margin (16.66%) improved compared to 2022, indicating better cost management and operational leverage. However, net profit declined to USD 56,464 thousand from USD 60,068 thousand, and net profit margin fell to 13.26% from 15.08%, mainly due to a higher effective tax rate (22.12% vs. 15.05%) and increased interest expense. Return on equity (19.73%) and return on assets (14.40%) were strong, reflecting efficient use of capital and assets. Overall, while core operating profitability improved, bottom-line earnings were pressured by higher tax and financing costs. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 was characterized by higher asset turnover (110.40% vs. 108.55% in 2023), indicating improved utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, cost control weakened, as evidenced by rising cost of goods sold and operating expenses, leading to lower margins. Net cash from operations dropped sharply to USD 25,524 thousand from USD 50,584 thousand, suggesting less efficient working capital management or higher cash outflows. Inventories increased substantially to USD 110,804 thousand, which may signal slower inventory turnover. Net cash from investing was more negative at USD (18,342) thousand, indicating increased investment activity. Net cash from financing was less negative at USD (5,735) thousand, reflecting reduced outflows. The net increase in cash was positive but modest at USD 1,447 thousand. Overall, while asset utilization improved, cash flow from operations and inventory management weakened. | Operational efficiency in 2023 was characterized by improved asset utilization and cost control. Asset turnover was 108.55%, indicating effective use of assets to generate revenue. Cost of goods sold increased only slightly relative to revenue, supporting a higher gross margin. Operating expenses rose to USD 70,518 thousand but were well managed relative to revenue growth. Net cash from operations decreased to USD 50,584 thousand from USD 72,825 thousand, suggesting some working capital pressures or timing differences. Inventory levels increased modestly to USD 76,720 thousand. Net cash from investing turned negative (USD -12,366 thousand), indicating increased investment activity, while net cash from financing was more negative (USD -31,542 thousand), reflecting higher dividend payouts and possibly debt repayments. Overall, the company maintained operational discipline but saw reduced operating cash flow. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a moderate increase in risk. The debt to equity ratio rose to 55.81%, reflecting higher leverage. The current ratio, while still strong at 307.72%, declined from the prior year, and the significant increase in inventories could pose liquidity risks if not managed. Interest coverage decreased to 1,492.83% from 2,004.32%, but remains at a very comfortable level. The effective tax rate decreased to 18.90%, which may benefit net income but could also reflect changes in geographic profit mix or tax planning. The substantial increase in dividends paid (USD 39,158 thousand vs. USD 17,294 thousand) may constrain future liquidity if not matched by cash generation. Overall, while the company remains financially sound, rising leverage, lower interest coverage, and increased inventory levels are early warning signs to monitor. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 remained generally favorable. The current ratio (336.17%) and interest coverage (2004.32%) were both very high, indicating low short-term liquidity and interest payment risk. The debt to equity ratio improved to 36.67%, reflecting conservative leverage. However, the effective tax rate increased significantly to 22.12%, which, along with higher interest expense, contributed to lower net profit. There is no evidence of excessive leverage or liquidity stress, but the decline in net cash from operations and higher tax burden warrant monitoring. No material early warning signs of financial distress are evident, but the company should watch for further increases in tax or financing costs. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Food Empire Holdings Limited's increased investment outflows in 2024 suggest a focus on growth or capacity expansion. However, the sharp decline in operating cash flow and the large dividend payout may pressure future cash reserves if not offset by improved profitability or working capital management. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in South-East Asia and Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and CIS markets, while Russia's revenue slightly declined. The product mix remains dominated by beverages, with notable growth in ingredients. Sustaining future performance will depend on restoring margin levels, managing inventory, and ensuring that investment and dividend policies are aligned with cash generation. Geographic diversification and product expansion provide growth opportunities, but operational and financial discipline will be critical to maintain financial health. | Looking ahead, Food Empire Holdings Limited's increased investment outflows in 2023 (net cash from investing: USD -12,366 thousand) suggest a focus on growth or capacity expansion, which could support future revenue. The sustainability of cash flows is a concern, as net cash from operations declined and dividend payouts increased to USD 17,294 thousand. Segment data shows continued strength in Beverages and Ingredients, with Beverages revenue rising to USD 324,366 thousand and Ingredients to USD 71,294 thousand. Geographically, revenue growth was strong in South-East Asia, Ukraine/Kazakhstan/CIS, and South Asia, partially offsetting a decline in Russia. This diversification may support future stability. To maintain performance, the company should focus on restoring operating cash flow, managing tax and interest costs, and ensuring investments yield returns. |
