# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Delfi Limited's revenue increased from USD 477,500,000 in 2022 to USD 538,153,000 in 2023, before declining to USD 502,655,000 in 2024. Gross margin has steadily declined over the period: 30.47% in 2022, 28.48% in 2023, and 27.42% in 2024, indicating rising direct costs relative to revenue. By product, Own Brands revenue was USD 281,849,000 in 2022, peaked at USD 309,829,000 in 2023, and fell to USD 282,028,000 in 2024, while Agency Brands grew from USD 195,644,000 in 2022 to USD 228,324,000 in 2023, then slightly decreased to USD 220,627,000 in 2024. Geographically, Indonesia remains the dominant market, with revenue of USD 317,446,000 in 2022, USD 353,080,000 in 2023, and USD 314,262,000 in 2024, while Regional Markets revenue increased from USD 185,073,000 in 2023 to USD 188,393,000 in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 13.26% in 2022 to 9.81% in 2023 and further to 9.17% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating efficiency. Operating income dropped from USD 63,339,000 in 2022 to USD 52,798,000 in 2023 and USD 46,085,000 in 2024, even as revenue fluctuated, indicating that cost increases outpaced revenue growth. Operating expenses rose from USD 85,692,000 in 2022 to USD 90,947,000 in 2023 and USD 91,733,000 in 2024, suggesting cost management challenges as expenses increased by USD 6,041,000 over the period while gross profit declined by USD 7,693,000 from 2022 to 2024. |

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Delfi Limited's total assets increased slightly to USD 428,228 thousand from USD 420,944 thousand in 2023, driven by a rise in non-current assets (USD 137,275 thousand vs. USD 126,047 thousand), while current assets declined marginally. Total liabilities rose to USD 163,643 thousand (from USD 154,724 thousand), mainly due to higher current liabilities (USD 149,181 thousand vs. USD 136,788 thousand), while non-current liabilities decreased. Shareholders' equity dipped slightly to USD 264,585 thousand (from USD 266,220 thousand), though retained earnings increased, indicating profit retention despite lower net profit. The current ratio decreased to 195.03% (from 215.59%), reflecting reduced short-term liquidity but still above 100%, suggesting adequate coverage of short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio rose to 61.85% (from 58.12%), indicating a modest increase in leverage. Overall, Delfi maintains a solid capital structure and liquidity position, though trends point to rising short-term obligations and leverage. | In 2023, Delfi Limited demonstrated a significant strengthening of its financial position. Total assets surged to USD 420,944 thousand from USD 112,329 thousand in 2022, primarily driven by a substantial increase in current assets (USD 294,897 thousand in 2023 vs. USD 48,303 thousand in 2022) and a notable rise in non-current assets. Total liabilities increased modestly to USD 154,724 thousand (from USD 148,894 thousand), but this was far outpaced by the growth in shareholders' equity, which more than doubled to USD 266,220 thousand (from USD 107,508 thousand). The current ratio improved dramatically to 215.59% in 2023 from 35.49% in 2022, indicating a much stronger liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio fell sharply to 58.12% from 138.50%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with reduced reliance on debt. Retained earnings also rose substantially to USD 193,647 thousand, supporting the company's equity base. Overall, Delfi Limited's balance sheet in 2023 reflects robust financial health, improved liquidity, and a lower risk capital structure. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability declined in 2024, with revenue falling to USD 502,655 thousand (from USD 538,153 thousand) and gross profit dropping to USD 137,818 thousand. Gross margin narrowed to 27.42% (from 28.48%), and operating margin decreased to 9.17% (from 9.81%), reflecting both lower sales and slightly higher operating expenses. Net profit fell sharply to USD 33,949 thousand (from USD 46,255 thousand), with net margin dropping to 6.75% (from 8.60%). Return on equity halved to 12.79% (from 24.75%), and return on assets fell to 8.00% (from 17.35%), indicating weaker earnings generation from both equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased to 30.87%. Overall, earnings quality weakened, with lower margins and returns across the board. | Delfi Limited achieved higher revenue in 2023 (USD 538,153 thousand) compared to 2022 (USD 477,500 thousand), indicating strong top-line growth. Gross profit also increased to USD 153,244 thousand, but gross margin declined to 28.48% from 30.47%, suggesting higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income decreased to USD 52,798 thousand (from USD 63,339 thousand), and operating margin fell to 9.81% (from 13.26%), indicating increased operating expenses or margin pressure. Net profit rose to USD 46,255 thousand (from USD 44,000 thousand), but net profit margin slightly decreased to 8.60% (from 9.21%). Return on equity (24.75%) and return on assets (17.35%) in 2023 were strong, reflecting efficient use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate decreased slightly to 29.26%. Overall, while revenue and net profit increased, margin compression at the gross and operating levels points to some cost or pricing pressures, though returns on equity and assets remain robust. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency deteriorated in 2024. Asset turnover declined significantly to 118.39% (from 201.83%), indicating less effective use of assets to generate revenue. Cost control was mixed: cost of goods sold decreased in absolute terms, but gross margin still contracted. Operating expenses rose slightly, further pressuring operating income. Inventories increased to USD 131,819 thousand (from USD 115,893 thousand), which may signal slower inventory turnover. However, net cash from operations more than doubled to USD 52,574 thousand (from USD 25,297 thousand), suggesting improved cash conversion despite weaker earnings. Working capital management is challenged by rising current liabilities and falling current assets. Net cash from investing and financing were both negative, with higher outflows than the prior year, and the net decrease in cash was smaller than in 2023. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed results. Asset turnover was high at 201.83%, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations improved significantly to USD 25,297 thousand (from USD 7,743 thousand), reflecting better cash generation from core activities. However, both net cash from investing (USD -23,970 thousand) and net cash from financing (USD -22,730 thousand) were negative, indicating outflows for investments and repayments/dividends. Working capital improved, as evidenced by the large increase in current assets relative to current liabilities. Inventory levels remained stable (USD 115,893 thousand in 2023 vs. USD 115,451 thousand in 2022), suggesting effective inventory management. Despite higher operating expenses, the company maintained positive cash flow from operations and increased its dividend payout (USD 29,060 thousand in 2023 vs. USD 19,196 thousand in 2022), indicating confidence in cash flow sustainability. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show some deterioration in 2024. The current ratio fell to 195.03%, indicating reduced but still strong liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased to 61.85%, reflecting higher leverage. Interest coverage declined to 3247.71% (from 4338.37%), but remains very robust, indicating low risk of interest payment default. The effective tax rate rose to 30.87%, which, combined with lower pre-tax income, further pressured net profit. The increase in current liabilities and decrease in current assets could signal rising short-term liquidity risk. The increase in inventories may also indicate potential obsolescence or slower sales. No immediate solvency concerns are evident, but the trend toward higher leverage and lower liquidity warrants monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 generally improved. The debt to equity ratio dropped to 58.12%, reducing leverage risk. The current ratio soared to 215.59%, indicating strong liquidity and a robust ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest coverage, while lower than 2022, remained very high at 4,338.37%, suggesting ample earnings to cover interest expenses. The effective tax rate decreased slightly to 29.26%, with no indication of significant tax risk. Interest expense increased to USD 1,217 thousand (from USD 630 thousand), but this remains manageable given the company's earnings. No material early warning signs are evident in the provided data; overall, financial risk appears to have decreased in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Delfi Limited's investment activity increased, as seen in higher net cash outflows from investing (USD -28,793 thousand vs. USD -23,970 thousand), suggesting ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions. Cash flow from operations improved significantly, supporting dividend payments (USD -26,545 thousand), though both investing and financing outflows increased. The company continues to return capital to shareholders, but the sustainability of dividends may be challenged if profitability does not recover. Segment data shows both Own Brands and Agency Brands revenues declined, with Own Brands seeing a larger drop. Geographically, Indonesia revenue fell, while regional markets saw a slight increase, indicating some resilience outside the core market. Overall, future performance will depend on the company's ability to restore revenue growth, manage costs, and maintain cash flow to support investments and dividends. | Delfi Limited's increased investment outflows in 2023 (net cash from investing: USD -23,970 thousand) suggest ongoing capital expenditure or strategic investments, which could support future growth. The company maintained a strong dividend policy, increasing dividends paid to USD 29,060 thousand, indicating confidence in ongoing cash flow generation. The significant increase in retained earnings and equity provides a solid foundation for future expansion or resilience. Revenue growth was driven by both Own Brands and Agency Brands, with Own Brands revenue rising to USD 309,829 thousand and Agency Brands to USD 228,324 thousand. Geographically, Indonesia remains the largest market (USD 353,080 thousand), with regional markets contributing USD 185,073 thousand, indicating a diversified revenue base. If current trends in revenue growth and asset expansion continue, and cost pressures are managed, Delfi Limited is well-positioned for sustained financial performance. |

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Delfi Limited faces market risks including currency risk due to transactional exposures in multiple foreign currencies such as USD, SGD, and EUR against functional currencies like IDR, PHP, and MYR. The Group actively manages currency volatility through foreign exchange forwards and hedging policies to reduce impact on profitability. Economic conditions such as geopolitical tensions, inflation, and cocoa price volatility significantly affect demand and cost structures. The company also faces competition and demand volatility in the chocolate confectionery industry, with challenges from rising cocoa prices, supply chain disruptions, and shifting consumer preferences. Market risks are mitigated by price adjustments, operational efficiency improvements, innovation, and strengthening distribution capabilities. Regular customer research and competitor activity reviews are conducted to monitor market conditions. The Group also monitors industry trends and consumer behavior to adapt strategies accordingly. | Delfi Limited faces market risks primarily from currency risk due to transactional exposures in multiple foreign currencies including USD, SGD, EUR, IDR, PHP, and MYR. Volatility in these currencies can impact profitability. The Group actively manages currency risk through forward contracts and currency-matched borrowings. Economic uncertainties such as geopolitical tensions, inflation, commodity price volatility (notably historic high cocoa prices), and fluctuating consumer confidence in key markets like Indonesia and the Philippines pose risks to demand and profit growth. Increased competition, especially in Indonesia, pressures margins and necessitates higher promotional spending.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Delfi Limited faces significant economic challenges including persistent inflation, currency volatility, and macroeconomic headwinds such as geopolitical tensions and trade wars expected to continue through 2025. The company is particularly impacted by record-high cocoa bean prices driven by supply constraints from climate-change induced droughts and disruptions in key producing countries like C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana. These elevated input costs pressure earnings and may lead to higher retail chocolate prices, potentially affecting consumer demand and sentiment. Additionally, weaker regional currencies, especially the depreciation of the Indonesian Rupiah against the US Dollar, have increased raw material costs and reduced profitability. The company also contends with supply chain disruptions and cost pressures in packaging and energy management. Economic growth in Indonesia and the Philippines provides some support, but overall economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures remain key risks that could impact revenue, profitability, and cash flow. Delfi is proactively managing these risks through price adjustments, operational efficiencies, innovation, and disciplined working capital management, but acknowledges ongoing uncertainty in the global and regional economic environment. | Delfi Limited faces several forward-looking economic challenges and uncertainties as outlined in the 2023 annual report. The macro-environment in key markets such as Indonesia and the Philippines is expected to remain uncertain and potentially challenging due to slowing global economies, foreign exchange volatility, and global macroeconomic uncertainty. Inflationary pressures are evident with soaring commodity prices, especially historic highs in cocoa prices, which increase input costs and could dampen consumer confidence and moderate profit growth. The company also faces risks from elevated interest rates, ongoing supply chain strains, and geopolitical tensions that contribute to economic uncertainty. Currency risk is significant due to transactional exposures in multiple currencies, requiring active foreign exchange risk management. Additionally, the potential for a decrease in consumer sentiment could weigh on consumer spending, impacting revenue and profitability. The company anticipates higher working capital requirements to support future growth but plans to tightly manage receivables, inventories, and payables. Climate change and its associated physical and transition risks also pose economic challenges, with the company conducting climate risk assessments and committing to sustainability initiatives.
