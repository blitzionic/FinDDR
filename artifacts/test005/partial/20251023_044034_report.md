## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited demonstrated a significant expansion in its balance sheet. Total assets increased to S$5,725.8 million from S$4,689.7 million in 2023, driven by both current and non-current asset growth. However, total liabilities also rose sharply to S$2,700.2 million (from S$1,675.8 million), with current liabilities nearly doubling to S$1,800.7 million. Shareholders' equity remained stable at S$2,599.0 million (2023: S$2,597.7 million), indicating that asset growth was primarily funded by increased leverage. The current ratio declined to 105.46% (2023: 147.87%), reflecting tighter short-term liquidity, though it remains above 100%. The debt to equity ratio rose to 103.89% (2023: 64.51%), highlighting a more leveraged capital structure. Retained earnings increased modestly to S$2,009.7 million. Overall, while the company expanded its asset base, it did so with a notable increase in liabilities, resulting in higher financial leverage and reduced liquidity buffers. | In 2023, ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited maintained a stable financial position. Total assets stood at S$4,689.7 million, slightly lower than 2022 (S$4,701.9 million), indicating marginal contraction. Current assets decreased to S$1,614.1 million, while non-current assets increased to S$3,075.6 million, suggesting ongoing investment in long-term assets. Total liabilities declined to S$1,675.8 million from S$1,696.9 million, with a notable reduction in non-current liabilities (S$584.2 million vs. S$656.1 million), though current liabilities rose to S$1,091.6 million. Shareholders' equity increased to S$2,597.7 million, and retained earnings grew to S$2,004.7 million, reflecting profit retention. The current ratio decreased to 147.87% (from 158.02%), but remains above 100%, indicating adequate short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved slightly to 64.51% (from 65.94%), reflecting a conservative capital structure with moderate leverage. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved in 2024, with revenue rising to S$4,476.5 million (2023: S$3,880.3 million) and net profit increasing to S$210.5 million (2023: S$180.5 million). Gross and operating margins edged up to 7.21% (2023: 7.01%), and net profit margin slightly improved to 4.70% (2023: 4.65%), indicating stable cost management relative to revenue growth. Return on equity increased to 8.10% (2023: 6.98%), and return on assets rose to 4.04% (2023: 3.84%), reflecting enhanced earnings generation from both equity and assets. The effective tax rate remained stable at (19.46%). Overall, the company delivered higher earnings on a growing revenue base, with modest margin improvements and solid returns on capital. | Profitability in 2023 showed modest improvement. Revenue increased to S$3,880.3 million (from S$3,780.8 million), and net profit rose to S$180.5 million (from S$173.1 million). Gross and operating margins were stable at 7.01% (slightly down from 7.14%), while net profit margin edged up to 4.65% (from 4.58%), indicating slightly better bottom-line efficiency. Return on equity was 6.98% and return on assets was 3.84%, both indicating moderate profitability relative to capital employed and assets. The effective tax rate was 19.64%, marginally lower than the prior year. Overall, earnings quality appears stable, with incremental improvements in net profitability despite only slight margin compression at the gross and operating levels. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed positive trends in 2024. Asset turnover improved to 85.96% (2023: 82.63%), indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased to S$547.5 million (2023: S$449.1 million), supporting the company's ability to fund operations internally. However, net cash used in investing activities rose substantially to S$(970.1) million (2023: S$(330.5) million), suggesting significant capital expenditures or investments. Working capital efficiency tightened, as seen in the lower current ratio and higher current liabilities. Despite increased operating expenses (S$4,153.6 million vs. S$3,608.2 million), the company maintained margin improvements, reflecting effective cost control relative to revenue growth. Dividends paid increased slightly to S$157.7 million. Overall, the company demonstrated improved operational cash flow and asset utilization, though higher investment outflows and tighter liquidity warrant monitoring. | Operational efficiency in 2023 was mixed. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses both increased in line with revenue, maintaining a consistent cost structure. Asset turnover was 82.63%, indicating moderate utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations declined significantly to S$449.1 million (from S$602.3 million), suggesting reduced cash conversion from earnings, possibly due to working capital changes or higher operating costs. Inventories increased to S$141.7 million (from S$120.1 million), which may indicate slower inventory turnover. Net cash used in investing activities rose to S$(330.5) million, reflecting increased capital expenditure or investments. Dividends paid increased to S$154.2 million, demonstrating a continued commitment to shareholder returns. Overall, while revenue and profit improved, the decline in operating cash flow and higher inventories warrant monitoring. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 point to increased leverage and reduced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio rose sharply to 103.89% (2023: 64.51%), and the current ratio fell to 105.46% (2023: 147.87%), indicating higher reliance on debt and tighter short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased to S$38.9 million (2023: S$22.9 million), and interest coverage declined to 830.08% (2023: 1,188.21%), though it remains at a comfortable level. The effective tax rate was stable at (19.46%), and there were no significant tax-related risks. The substantial increase in both current and non-current liabilities, alongside large investing outflows, suggests elevated financial risk if cash flows were to weaken. No immediate solvency concerns are evident, but the trend toward higher leverage and lower liquidity is a potential early warning signal. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 remained generally conservative. The current ratio, while lower at 147.87%, still indicates strong liquidity. Debt to equity improved to 64.51%, reflecting prudent leverage. Interest expense increased to S$22.9 million (from S$13.3 million), but interest coverage, though lower at 1,188.21% (from 2,030.08%), remains extremely robust, indicating ample ability to service debt. The effective tax rate was stable at 19.64%. The increase in current liabilities and decrease in current ratio suggest some pressure on short-term liquidity, and the significant drop in operating cash flow could be an early warning sign if the trend continues. However, overall risk remains well-managed. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company’s significant increase in investing outflows (S$(970.1) million) in 2024 suggests a strategic focus on expansion or asset renewal, which could support future revenue growth. Net cash from operations remains strong, and dividend payments are stable, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue growth was broad-based, with notable increases in Public Transport, Taxi/Private Hire, and Other Private Transport segments. Geographically, the United Kingdom/EU and Australia saw substantial revenue gains, while Singapore remained the largest market. The sustainability of cash flows will depend on the returns generated from recent investments and the company’s ability to manage higher leverage. If operational improvements and revenue growth persist, future financial performance could strengthen, but ongoing monitoring of liquidity and debt levels is warranted. | Looking ahead, ComfortDelGro's increased investment outflows (net cash from investing at S$(330.5) million) suggest ongoing capital expenditure, potentially supporting future growth. The strong net increase in cash (S$856.9 million) and high net cash from financing (S$967.0 million) indicate robust liquidity and possible new financing activities. The company maintained and increased its dividend payout, signaling confidence in cash flow sustainability. Revenue growth was driven by public transport and taxi/private hire segments, with public transport revenue rising to S$2,959.3 million and taxi/private hire to S$574.7 million. Geographically, Singapore remains the core market, with revenue increasing to S$2,227.1 million, while the UK/EU segment also grew. These trends suggest continued focus on core transport services and key geographies. However, the decline in operating cash flow and rising inventories should be monitored as potential headwinds to future performance. |
