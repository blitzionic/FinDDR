# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | QAF Limited's revenue increased steadily from SGD 577,523 thousand in 2022 to SGD 628,590 thousand in 2023, and further to SGD 636,107 thousand in 2024. Gross profit also rose from SGD 262,655 thousand in 2022 to SGD 291,524 thousand in 2023 and SGD 302,019 thousand in 2024, with gross margin improving from 45.48% in 2022 to 46.38% in 2023 and 47.48% in 2024. By product, Bakery remained the dominant segment, growing from SGD 419,712 thousand in 2022 to SGD 455,472 thousand in 2023 and SGD 455,968 thousand in 2024. Distribution and warehousing revenue increased from SGD 148,941 thousand in 2022 to SGD 162,189 thousand in 2023 and SGD 167,973 thousand in 2024. By region, the Philippines led with SGD 271,050 thousand in 2024, though down from SGD 282,684 thousand in 2023, while Singapore revenue grew from SGD 205,918 thousand in 2022 to SGD 231,357 thousand in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved significantly from 2.87% in 2022 to 5.99% in 2023, before slightly declining to 5.58% in 2024. Operating income rose from SGD 16,571 thousand in 2022 to SGD 37,642 thousand in 2023, then decreased to SGD 35,506 thousand in 2024, despite revenue growth. Operating expenses increased each year, from SGD 246,084 thousand in 2022 to SGD 253,882 thousand in 2023 and SGD 266,513 thousand in 2024, indicating rising costs that outpaced operating income growth in 2024. This suggests that while revenue and gross profit improved, cost management became more challenging in the latest year. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate dropped from 30.00% in 2022 to 32.72% in 2023, then sharply to 22.31% in 2024, which contributed to a higher net profit of SGD 34,678 thousand in 2024 compared to SGD 27,579 thousand in 2023 and SGD 25,748 thousand in 2022. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

The current ratio stood at 273.60%, indicating robust short-term liquidity, though it declined from 313.67% in 2022, reflecting a relative increase in current liabilities (SGD 141,841,000) compared to current assets (SGD 388,077,000). Total liabilities increased to SGD 180,678,000, with a shift towards higher current liabilities and lower non-current liabilities, suggesting a more short-term oriented capital structure.

Operating income more than doubled to SGD 37,642,000, with the operating margin rising to 5.99% from 2.87%, reflecting better cost control and operational leverage. Net profit was SGD 27,579,000, with a net margin of 4.39%, slightly lower than 2022’s 4.46% due to a higher effective tax rate (32.72% vs. 30.00%) and increased interest expense. Return on equity (5.60%) and return on assets (4.14%) indicate moderate returns relative to the company’s capital base. Overall, earnings quality is solid, with improved operating performance, though net profitability was tempered by higher taxes and interest costs. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed positive trends in 2024. Asset turnover increased to 95.41% (from 94.25%), indicating improved utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations rose to SGD 65,255,000 (from SGD 57,572,000), reflecting stronger cash generation from core activities. Inventory levels increased to SGD 58,228,000 (from SGD 54,006,000), which may warrant monitoring for potential buildup. Operating margin slightly declined to 5.58% (from 5.99%) due to higher operating expenses, but this was offset by improved gross margin and net margin. Net cash from investing was less negative at (SGD 13,153,000) compared to (SGD 33,416,000), suggesting reduced capital outflows. Net cash from financing was more negative at (SGD 50,704,000), likely due to debt repayments or dividend payments. Overall, QAF Limited maintained strong operational cash flow and asset efficiency, with some increase in inventory and higher operating expenses. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023. Asset turnover was 94.25%, indicating effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased to SGD 57,572,000, reflecting strong cash generation from core activities. Operating expenses grew modestly to SGD 253,882,000, but at a slower rate than revenue, supporting margin expansion. Inventory levels remained stable (SGD 54,006,000), suggesting efficient inventory management. Net cash from investing was negative (SGD -33,416,000), indicating investment in growth or asset renewal, while net cash from financing was also negative (SGD -22,960,000), primarily due to dividend payments (SGD -28,763,000). The net increase in cash was marginal (SGD 1,196,000), showing balanced cash flows. Overall, the company demonstrated improved cost control, asset utilization, and sustainable cash generation. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators improved in 2024. The current ratio increased to 294.22%, indicating strong liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 32.67%, reflecting lower leverage. Interest coverage remained very high at 1,768.23%, only slightly lower than 2023, indicating ample ability to service interest obligations. The effective tax rate dropped to 22.31% from 32.72%, which may be due to favorable tax developments or one-off items; this should be monitored for sustainability. No significant increase in financial risk is evident, but the higher negative cash flow from financing activities and increased inventories should be watched for potential future liquidity or working capital pressures. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a slight increase in leverage, with the debt to equity ratio rising to 37.11%. The current ratio, while still strong, declined to 273.60%, reflecting higher current liabilities. Interest expense increased to SGD 2,080,000, but interest coverage improved significantly to 1809.71%, indicating ample ability to service debt. The effective tax rate rose to 32.72%, which, along with higher interest costs, slightly pressured net margins. The shift towards more current liabilities and reduced non-current liabilities may increase short-term refinancing risk. However, overall liquidity and coverage ratios remain robust, and no immediate financial distress signals are evident. |
| Future financial performance projection | QAF Limited’s 2024 results suggest a positive outlook for future financial performance. The company maintained strong operating cash flow (SGD 65,255,000) and continued its dividend policy with consistent payouts (SGD 28,763,000). Reduced net cash outflows from investing activities indicate lower capital expenditure or asset sales, which may impact future growth if not balanced with reinvestment. Segment analysis shows stable bakery revenue and growth in distribution and warehousing, while geographic revenue increased in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and other countries, offsetting a decline in the Philippines. This diversification supports future resilience. The improved profitability, strong liquidity, and conservative leverage position QAF Limited well for sustainable performance, though ongoing monitoring of inventory levels and capital allocation will be important. | QAF Limited’s 2023 results suggest a positive outlook for future performance. The company invested significantly (net investing cash outflow of SGD 33,416,000), which may support future growth. Cash flow from operations remains strong, supporting ongoing dividend payments (SGD 28,763,000), though at a reduced level compared to 2022. Revenue growth was broad-based across products and geographies, with notable increases in bakery and distribution segments, and in key markets such as the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and Australia. The company’s ability to generate cash, invest in growth, and maintain dividends indicates financial sustainability. However, the trend of rising current liabilities and a higher effective tax rate warrants monitoring. Continued focus on operational efficiency and prudent capital management will be key to sustaining performance. |

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | QAF Limited faces economic challenges including inflationary pressures and a higher cost-of-living environment that affect consumer purchasing power and confidence across its operating regions. The Group notes modest economic growth expected in its markets with risks from geopolitical uncertainties and potential higher tariffs. Cost pressures are evident in rising labour and distribution costs, despite some reductions in materials and utilities costs. Market conditions remain challenging with low consumer confidence, especially in Australia and Singapore, impacting demand and pricing. The Group also faces commodity price volatility affecting input costs such as wheat, oil, and gas. Supply chain disruptions and increasing costs, including transportation and logistics infrastructure constraints, pose risks to resource availability and operational continuity. Foreign exchange risks arise from transactional and translation exposures in multiple currencies, notably the Australian Dollar, Malaysian Ringgit, and Philippine Peso, which can impact financial results.

Transition risks related to market changes, policy and legal developments, and technology costs to reduce emissions also present economic uncertainties. The Group manages these risks through diversified supplier networks, business continuity plans, insurance coverage, and investments in energy efficiency and green technologies. | QAF Limited faces several economic challenges and uncertainties as outlined in the 2023 annual report. Inflationary pressures have impacted raw material costs, which rose by 7%, utilities costs increased by 7%, and labour costs grew by 11% due to a tight labour market and government-mandated minimum wage increases in certain regions. The Australian economy is expected to experience a soft landing in 2024 with high interest rates and inflationary pressures continuing to weigh on disposable income, although inflation is subsiding and interest rate increases may pause or be cut later in 2024. The Malaysian economy saw inflation decline steadily but consumers remain cautious amid a slower domestic economy, tighter labour market, and elevated prices. The weakening of the Malaysian Ringgit may offset benefits from easing inflationary pressures on raw materials. In Singapore, business conditions are expected to be challenging with slow economic growth, elevated prices from supply chain uncertainties, and unpredictable global weather conditions. The Group also faces macroeconomic risks such as higher interest rates, recession risks, and liquidity crises that could negatively impact financial performance. Cost pressures from commodity price volatility, including wheat, oil, and gas, remain a concern. Additionally, climate-related physical risks such as increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (flooding, heatwaves, storms) and transition risks related to changes in customer behaviour, market uncertainty, and increased costs to transition to lower emissions technology pose further economic uncertainties. The Group is actively managing these risks through strategic price and product mix adjustments, investment in green energy, flood mitigation measures, and business continuity planning. Foreign exchange risks, particularly exposure to AUD, MYR, and Philippine Peso fluctuations, also contribute to economic uncertainties. |
