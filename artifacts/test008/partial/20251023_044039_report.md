## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Far East Holdings Berhad demonstrated a robust financial position. Total assets increased to RM1,795,463 thousand from RM1,701,661 thousand in 2023, indicating asset growth. Total liabilities rose slightly to RM276,694 thousand (from RM271,246 thousand), but shareholders' equity expanded more significantly to RM1,467,230 thousand (from RM1,382,842 thousand), reflecting strong retained earnings growth (RM1,269,245 thousand in 2024 vs. RM1,184,873 thousand in 2023). The current ratio, while declining to 266.90% from 304.35%, remains very healthy, indicating ample liquidity to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio improved to 18.86% from 19.62%, showing a modest reduction in leverage and a conservative capital structure. Overall, the company’s balance sheet in 2024 reflects strong solvency, high liquidity, and prudent financial management. | In 2023, Far East Holdings Berhad maintained a strong financial position. Total assets stood at RM1,701,661 thousand, with total liabilities at RM271,246 thousand, resulting in a robust shareholders' equity of RM1,382,842 thousand. The current ratio improved to 304.35% from 254.87% in 2022, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity and a strong ability to cover current obligations. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 19.62% from 23.38%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with lower reliance on debt financing. Retained earnings increased to RM1,184,873 thousand, supporting equity growth. Overall, the company’s balance sheet demonstrates high liquidity, low leverage, and a solid equity base in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved markedly in 2024. Revenue surged to RM863,587 thousand from RM542,359 thousand, a 59% increase. Gross profit rose to RM334,592 thousand (from RM219,986 thousand), though gross margin slightly declined to 38.74% (from 40.38%), suggesting higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income more than doubled to RM140,319 thousand, with operating margin improving to 16.25% (from 10.32%), indicating better cost control at the operating level. Net profit nearly doubled to RM202,350 thousand, and net profit margin increased to 23.43% (from 19.44%), reflecting strong bottom-line performance. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) saw dramatic improvements to 14.20% and 11.57% respectively (from 0.02% and 0.01%), highlighting significantly enhanced earnings quality and capital efficiency. The effective tax rate rose slightly to 19.95% (from 18.57%), but remains moderate. | Profitability declined in 2023 compared to 2022. Revenue dropped significantly from RM785,657 thousand to RM542,359 thousand. Net profit also fell from RM223,817 thousand to RM105,420 thousand. Gross margin for 2023 was 40.38%, with operating and net profit margins at 10.32% and 19.44%, respectively. These margins, while healthy, are lower than the prior year’s net margin of 28.49%. Return on equity and assets were modest at 0.02% and 0.01%, respectively, indicating subdued returns relative to the company’s asset and equity base. The effective tax rate normalized to 18.57% from an anomalously high 17,027.42% in 2022, suggesting a return to typical tax expense levels. Overall, while margins remain positive, the sharp decline in revenue and profit signals weaker earnings quality in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024. Asset turnover jumped to 49.39% from 0.06%, indicating much more effective use of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses increased to RM194,273 thousand (from RM163,980 thousand), but this was outpaced by revenue growth, supporting the higher operating margin. Net cash from operations rose sharply to RM139,042 thousand (from RM77,518 thousand), reflecting improved cash generation from core activities. Inventory levels increased to RM11,419 thousand (from RM7,222 thousand), but remain a small proportion of current assets, suggesting efficient inventory management. Working capital remains strong, with current assets of RM306,382 thousand and current liabilities of RM114,792 thousand. Net cash from investing was positive at RM5,249 thousand, though lower than 2023, while net cash from financing was a significant outflow at RM(159,243) thousand, largely due to higher dividends paid (RM106,891 thousand in 2024 vs. RM89,076 thousand in 2023). The net decrease in cash was reduced to RM(14,952) thousand (from RM(38,652) thousand), indicating improved cash flow management. | Operational efficiency in 2023 was mixed. Cost of goods sold was RM323,373 thousand, resulting in a gross profit of RM219,986 thousand. Operating expenses were RM163,980 thousand, leading to an operating income of RM55,986 thousand. Asset turnover was low at 0.06, indicating limited revenue generation from the asset base. Net cash from operations was RM77,518 thousand, a substantial decrease from RM167,032 thousand in 2022, reflecting reduced cash-generating ability. Inventories decreased to RM7,222 thousand, suggesting tighter inventory management. Net cash from investing was positive at RM13,355 thousand, while net cash from financing was negative at RM(129,525) thousand, indicating outflows likely due to debt repayment or dividends. The net decrease in cash was RM(38,652) thousand. Dividend payments increased to RM(89,076) thousand. Overall, while cost control appears reasonable, lower asset utilization and reduced operating cash flow point to efficiency challenges in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 remain favorable. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 18.86%, reflecting low leverage. The current ratio, though lower, is still robust at 266.90%, indicating strong liquidity. Interest coverage soared to 2821.62% (from 1065.99%), showing that operating income is more than sufficient to cover interest expenses, reducing solvency risk. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 19.95%, but this does not pose a significant risk. There is a moderate increase in current liabilities (RM114,792 thousand from RM95,005 thousand), but this is offset by higher current assets. No significant red flags are evident in the financial risk profile for 2024. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 were generally favorable. The current ratio rose to 304.35%, indicating strong liquidity. The debt to equity ratio declined to 19.62%, reflecting reduced leverage. Interest coverage was exceptionally high at 1,065.99%, suggesting ample ability to service interest obligations. The effective tax rate normalized to 18.57%, reducing tax-related volatility. No significant increases in liabilities or unusual tax rates were observed. However, the sharp decline in revenue and net profit, along with a net cash outflow, could signal early warning signs if the trend continues. Overall, the company’s risk profile remains low, but ongoing profitability and cash flow trends warrant monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company’s strong operational cash flow in 2024 (RM139,042 thousand) and continued investment activity (positive net cash from investing) suggest a sustainable financial base for future growth. The substantial dividend payout (RM106,891 thousand) indicates a commitment to shareholder returns, but also results in significant financing outflows. The increase in retained earnings and equity supports future reinvestment capacity. Revenue growth was driven by both fresh fruit bunch sales (RM165,369 thousand) and crude palm oil, palm kernel, and others (RM698,218 thousand), indicating diversified product strength. While geographic revenue data for 2024 is unavailable, the strong domestic performance in 2023 suggests a solid base. If current trends in revenue and profitability persist, and with prudent capital management, Far East Holdings Berhad is well-positioned for continued financial stability and potential growth, though ongoing high dividend payouts may constrain cash reserves if not matched by continued strong cash generation. | Looking ahead, Far East Holdings Berhad’s financial outlook is mixed. The company generated positive cash from investing activities (RM13,355 thousand), which may indicate asset sales or reduced capital expenditure. However, net cash from operations declined sharply, and the company experienced a net cash outflow of RM(38,652) thousand. Dividend payments increased, which, if sustained without earnings recovery, could pressure liquidity. Revenue remains concentrated in Malaysia and is heavily reliant on the sale of crude palm oil, palm kernel, and fresh fruit bunches, both of which saw declines in 2023. Unless market conditions improve or diversification occurs, revenue and profit growth may remain subdued. The strong balance sheet and low leverage provide a buffer, but future performance will depend on the company’s ability to restore revenue growth and sustain cash flows. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | FEHB faces market risks including fluctuating crude palm oil (CPO) prices which impact revenue and profitability. The Group also contends with demand volatility influenced by external market factors such as climate change and regulatory developments like the European Union Deforestation-Free Regulation. Competition and industry trends necessitate compliance with sustainability certifications (MSPO, ISCC) to access premium markets. Customer behavior and market expectations drive the need for sustainable practices. Mitigation measures include improving productivity through semi-mechanisation, phased replanting, cost control mechanisms, and ensuring expenditures align with budgets. The Group also explores market diversification opportunities to manage economic challenges. | The Group faces market risks primarily from fluctuations in crude palm oil (CPO) prices influenced by global events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, export bans by Indonesia, and demand changes from major consumers like India and China. Weather conditions, including El-Nino and unfavorable rainfall patterns, significantly impact palm oil production and thus market supply and prices. The Group mitigates price volatility risks through cost control mechanisms, adjusting expenditures according to budget estimates, and productivity improvement programs. Additionally, the Group monitors industry trends and customer behavior by maintaining certifications such as MSPO and ISCC to enhance competitiveness and brand trust. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include over-dependence on foreign workers, which previously caused severe labour shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic. FEHB mitigates this by maximising mechanisation, enhancing local workforce participation, providing incentives, extending work permits, and improving estate infrastructure. Unfavourable weather conditions such as excessive rainfall and droughts affect oil palm yields; mitigation includes drainage improvements, road maintenance, timely fertiliser application, and utilisation of Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) to reduce moisture loss. Pest and disease risks (bagworms, rats, Ganoderma Boninense) threaten production; mitigations involve pest census, immediate treatments, biological control plants, and mounding methods. Yield determinants and factors contributing to oil losses in crude palm oil are managed by compliance with Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), mechanisation, special task forces for fruit collection, and harvesting at optimal maturity. Operational cost risks are controlled through upkeep programs, budget adherence, and maintaining harvesting rounds. Food safety challenges are addressed by clean fruit handling, ripeness standards, good manufacturing practices, and controlled fertiliser and chemical use. The Group also invests in digital systems to improve operational efficiency and manages cybersecurity risks. | Operational risks include unfavorable weather conditions such as heavy rains, flooding, and droughts that disrupt harvesting and transportation of Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB), leading to lower production. The Group mitigates these by improving drainage systems, constructing bunds and bridges, maintaining roads, and ensuring timely fertiliser application. Over-dependence on foreign workers poses a risk due to potential labor shortages; mitigation includes semi-mechanisation, replacing non-critical jobs with local workers, bearing work permit extension costs, and incentive schemes to retain workers. Yield determining factors such as planting materials and replanting programs are managed through use of high-yield clonal materials and scheduled replanting to sustain production. Transportation of FFB is managed by maintaining estate roads and avoiding double handling to reduce oil losses. The Group also implements Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Control (HIRARC) with safety training to reduce workplace accidents. |
| Financial Risks | FEHB is exposed to financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, agricultural risk, and market price risk. Credit risk arises mainly from trade and other receivables; mitigated by dealing with high credit rating counterparties, ongoing credit evaluations, and applying MFRS 9 expected credit loss assessments. Liquidity risk is managed by active cash flow management and ensuring availability of funding to meet obligations. Interest rate risk is primarily from floating rate term loans; sensitivity analysis indicates no material impact from 100 basis points changes. Agricultural risk relates to environmental and climatic changes affecting production volume and commodity prices; impact is considered insignificant to financial statements. Market price risk arises from investments in debt instruments; management monitors investments individually and considers impact insignificant. The Group maintains a conservative capital structure with minimal external borrowings, strong cash reserves, and finances capital expenditures internally to maintain financial resilience. | Financial risks identified include credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk arises from receivables and loans to subsidiaries, associates, and related parties; the Group mitigates this by dealing with high credit rating counterparties, monitoring credit quality, and assessing impairment individually.
