## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Southern Score Builders Berhad demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets rising to RM238,249,710 from RM197,493,565 in 2023, indicating asset growth. Current assets (RM228,371,739) continue to dominate the asset base, and non-current assets remain stable. Total liabilities increased significantly to RM80,540,310 (from RM48,510,055), mainly due to higher current liabilities (RM80,273,018). Shareholders' equity also grew to RM157,709,400, reflecting retained earnings growth. The current ratio, while still robust at 284.49%, declined from 390.20%, suggesting a reduction in liquidity buffer but still indicating strong short-term solvency. The debt to equity ratio increased to 51.07% from 32.56%, showing a higher reliance on debt financing, but the capital structure remains equity-heavy. Overall, the company maintains a healthy balance sheet, though the rise in liabilities and leverage warrants monitoring. | In 2023, Southern Score Builders Berhad demonstrated a strong financial position. Total assets stood at MYR 197,493,565, with current assets comprising the majority at MYR 187,627,646. Total liabilities decreased significantly to MYR 48,510,055 from MYR 73,382,560 in 2022, indicating deleveraging. Shareholders' equity increased to MYR 148,983,510, reflecting retained earnings growth. The current ratio improved to 390.20% (from 298.76%), highlighting robust liquidity and a strong ability to meet short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio fell to 32.56% (from 50.13%), indicating a more conservative capital structure with reduced reliance on debt financing. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved in absolute terms, with revenue surging to RM170,717,663 (up from RM97,933,052) and net profit rising to RM31,451,786 (from RM25,311,419). However, margins compressed: gross margin fell to 28.71% (from 34.47%), operating margin to 23.64% (from 29.90%), and net profit margin to 18.42% (from 25.85%), indicating that costs grew faster than revenue. Return on equity improved to 20.51% (from 17.14%) and return on assets to 14.44% (from 12.13%), reflecting better asset and equity utilization. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 24.17%. Overall, while earnings quality is strong with higher profits and returns, margin compression signals rising cost pressures. | Profitability improved markedly in 2023 despite a sharp revenue decline to MYR 97,933,052 (from MYR 234,859,360 in 2022). Gross margin rose to 34.47% (from 20.84%), operating margin to 29.90% (from 17.87%), and net profit margin to 25.85% (from 7.65%), reflecting effective cost control and operational efficiency. Net profit increased to MYR 25,311,419 (from MYR 17,956,976), and both ROE (17.14%) and ROA (12.13%) were strong, indicating high returns on equity and assets. The effective tax rate decreased to 22.32% (from 36.47%), supporting higher net profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved, as evidenced by asset turnover increasing to 78.36% (from 46.94%), indicating more effective use of assets to generate revenue. Cost control appears challenged, with cost of goods sold and operating expenses rising faster than revenue, leading to lower margins. Net cash from operations turned positive at RM1,400,346 (from negative RM10,344,871), a notable improvement in cash generation. Working capital remains strong, supported by high current assets, though the current ratio declined. Cash flow from investing was slightly positive (RM132,015), and financing outflows decreased to RM18,544,858. The net decrease in cash was RM17,012,497, a significant improvement over the prior year. Dividend payments remained stable at RM22,725,896, indicating consistent shareholder returns. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023, as evidenced by higher margins and a strong asset turnover ratio of 46.94%. Operating expenses decreased to MYR 4,477,720 (from MYR 6,990,889), and cost of goods sold fell in line with lower revenue. However, net cash from operations was negative at (MYR 10,344,871), a reversal from positive MYR 7,483,517 in 2022, suggesting working capital challenges or timing issues in cash collections. Net cash from investing remained modestly negative at (MYR 812,753), while net cash from financing was also negative at (MYR 30,239,566), reflecting significant dividend payments (MYR 22,725,896) and possible debt repayments. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk increased moderately in 2024. The debt to equity ratio rose to 51.07%, reflecting higher leverage, though still within manageable levels. The current ratio, while still high, declined, suggesting reduced liquidity coverage. Interest expense increased, but interest coverage remains extremely strong at 4929.24%, indicating ample ability to service debt. The effective tax rate rose to 24.17%, slightly increasing the tax burden. The significant increase in current liabilities and overall liabilities could pose liquidity and refinancing risks if not managed. No inventory data is available, limiting analysis of working capital composition. Overall, while risks have increased, the company retains strong coverage and liquidity metrics. | Financial risk indicators generally improved in 2023. The current ratio and interest coverage (17,893.14%) remained extremely high, indicating low short-term liquidity and interest payment risk. The debt to equity ratio declined, reducing leverage risk. The effective tax rate dropped, lowering tax-related risk. However, the negative net cash from operations and large cash outflows (net decrease in cash of MYR 41,397,190) are early warning signs of potential liquidity strain if not addressed. The company’s reliance on a single segment and geography (100% construction, 100% Malaysia) also presents concentration risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company’s strong revenue growth and improved cash from operations in 2024 provide a positive outlook for future performance. Investment activity was minimal, with only a small net inflow from investing, suggesting limited expansion or capital expenditure. Dividend policy remained unchanged, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns but also a potential constraint on reinvestment. The business remains concentrated in construction and Malaysia, with no diversification by segment or geography, which could expose it to sector or regional risks. Sustained positive operating cash flow and robust asset turnover support ongoing operations, but margin compression and rising leverage should be monitored for future impact on profitability and financial flexibility. | Looking ahead, the company’s strong equity base and high profitability provide a solid foundation, but the sharp revenue decline and negative operating cash flow raise concerns about sustainability. Significant dividend payouts and reduced financing inflows may constrain future liquidity. The lack of diversification in both segment and geography could expose the company to market-specific risks. Unless revenue stabilizes or grows, and cash flow from operations improves, future financial performance may be pressured. Investment activity remains limited, suggesting a cautious approach to expansion. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks from the inherently competitive construction industry with established players and new entrants competing for projects. Economic and political risks arise from the cyclical nature of the construction industry and potential political, economic, and regulatory changes that can impact financial performance and business prospects. The global and Malaysian economies may face slowdowns, dampening demand for construction services. Demand volatility is influenced by shifts in market sentiment affecting investments in infrastructure and property development. Building material costs remain elevated due to supply chain issues and inflationary pressures. The Group mitigates these risks by maintaining a competitive edge through technological advancements, prudent management, adaptive investment strategies, strategic partnerships, expanding market reach domestically and internationally, prioritising local suppliers, cultivating long-term supplier relationships, and leveraging bulk purchasing to secure competitive prices and steady supply. The Group also actively pursues projects aligned with strategic priorities and monitors industry trends such as the data centre boom in Malaysia. | Southern Score Builders operates in a highly competitive construction industry with risks from existing rivals and new entrants. The economic slowdown in Malaysia and globally poses significant risks to demand for construction services, potentially reducing investments in public infrastructure and property development. The construction sector's growth pace has slowed, and market sentiment softness may impact future projects. The Group mitigates these risks by leveraging its established track record, large customer base, experienced management, and technology adoption, including IBS and robotic construction technology. It pursues strategic collaborations and partnerships domestically and internationally to enhance resilience and expand market presence. The Group also plans geographical expansion beyond Kuala Lumpur to Johor, Seremban, and Penang to diversify revenue sources and mitigate market fluctuations. Raw material supply risks have reduced post-pandemic but remain due to global geopolitical instability and economic slowdown; the Group mitigates this by sourcing mostly from local suppliers with long-term relationships and bulk procurement at competitive rates. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include challenges in business operations such as supply chain disruptions impacting availability and cost of building materials, although these have eased post-pandemic. The Group emphasises effective supply chain management, responsible sourcing, and local procurement to optimise costs, reduce carbon footprint, and support communities. Risks related to technology systems and data privacy are addressed through robust IT policies, security protocols, regular audits, employee training, and compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010, resulting in zero data breaches in FYE 2024. Human resources risks are managed via comprehensive Employee Handbook, Code of Conduct, Workplace Harassment Prevention Policy, and compliance with labour laws, with zero reported discrimination or human rights violations. Occupational safety and health risks are mitigated through compliance with relevant laws, safety policies, and certifications such as SHASSIC. The Group also implements measures to enhance operational efficiencies and reduce environmental impact, including optimising construction schedules and fuel usage monitoring. | Operational risks include challenges in business operations, supply chain, technology systems, and human resources. The Group faces risks related to the accuracy of construction contract revenue recognition and recoverability of trade receivables, requiring significant management judgment. The Group has implemented safety, health, and environment policies and procedures to maintain safe working environments on construction sites. It conducts regular safety campaigns, tool inspections, and promotes ethical business practices to prevent corruption and unethical conduct. The Group embraces advanced technologies such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and robotics to improve productivity, reduce human error, optimize costs, and enhance safety. Internal audit functions are outsourced to independent firms to assess and strengthen internal controls. The Group maintains a governance structure with clear delegation of responsibilities to the Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC) and Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC). |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks faced by the Group include credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk arises from potential financial loss if customers or counterparties fail to meet obligations; mitigated by credit verification procedures, diverse creditworthy counterparties, monitoring of receivables, and impairment analysis using expected credit loss models. Concentration risk exists due to significant exposure to top customers but is managed through diversification. Liquidity risk involves the ability to meet financial obligations timely; managed by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, diverse committed and uncommitted credit facilities, and monitoring maturity profiles of liabilities.
