## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Ekovest Berhad's total assets increased slightly to RM11,521,178,000 (from RM11,386,120,000 in 2023), indicating modest asset growth. Total liabilities also rose to RM8,705,372,000 (from RM8,589,650,000), with current liabilities increasing significantly to RM1,806,235,000 (from RM1,462,749,000), while non-current liabilities decreased to RM6,871,998,000 (from RM7,126,901,000). Shareholders' equity declined marginally to RM2,295,557,000 (from RM2,305,252,000), and retained earnings dropped to RM956,748,000 (from RM1,083,989,000), reflecting the impact of negative net profit. The current ratio deteriorated to 61.86% (from 90.83%), signaling weaker short-term liquidity and a potential challenge in meeting short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio increased to 379.23% (from 372.61%), highlighting a highly leveraged capital structure with significant reliance on debt financing. Overall, while asset growth is positive, the company faces increased leverage and reduced liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, Ekovest Berhad's total assets increased slightly to MYR 11,386,120 thousand from MYR 11,227,269 thousand in 2022, indicating modest asset growth. However, total liabilities also rose to MYR 8,589,650 thousand (from MYR 8,365,252 thousand), outpacing the growth in assets. Shareholders' equity declined to MYR 2,305,252 thousand (from MYR 2,408,211 thousand), reflecting accumulated losses and reduced retained earnings (MYR 1,083,989 thousand vs. MYR 1,186,879 thousand). The current ratio fell to 90.83% (from 108.92%), signaling weaker short-term liquidity and a potential challenge in meeting current obligations. The debt to equity ratio increased to 372.61% (from 347.36%), highlighting a highly leveraged capital structure and increased reliance on debt financing. Overall, while asset growth was positive, the company’s financial health in 2023 was pressured by higher leverage, declining equity, and reduced liquidity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue grew to RM1,146,947,000 in 2024 (from RM1,116,909,000), with gross profit rising to RM401,260,000 (from RM372,466,000). Gross margin improved to 34.99% (from 33.35%), and operating margin strengthened to 22.95% (from 17.02%), reflecting better cost control and operational efficiency. Operating income increased to RM263,208,000 (from RM190,077,000). However, net profit remained negative at (RM118,208,000), though this is an improvement from (RM109,324,000) in 2023. Net profit margin worsened slightly to (10.31%) from (9.79%), indicating continued bottom-line challenges. Return on equity and assets, while still negative, showed slight improvement to (5.14%) and (1.03%) respectively. The effective tax rate, though lower at 134.57% (from 1009.33%), remains abnormally high, further eroding net profitability. Overall, while operational profitability improved, high interest and tax expenses continue to suppress net earnings quality. | Profitability in 2023 showed mixed signals. Revenue grew significantly to MYR 1,116,909 thousand (from MYR 808,500 thousand), but cost of goods sold also increased, resulting in a gross margin decline to 33.35% (from 35.03%). Operating margin dropped to 17.02% (from 22.26%), indicating higher operating expenses relative to revenue. Net profit remained negative at (MYR 109,324 thousand), though the net loss narrowed compared to 2022 (MYR 123,446 thousand). The net profit margin improved to (9.79%) from (15.27%), but remains negative. Return on equity and assets were both negative at (4.64%) and (0.97%) respectively, reflecting ongoing losses and inefficient asset utilization. The effective tax rate spiked to 1009.33%, suggesting significant non-deductible expenses or deferred tax impacts. Overall, while top-line growth was strong, earnings quality was undermined by persistent losses and margin compression. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost of goods sold remained stable at RM745,687,000 (vs RM744,443,000), while operating expenses decreased significantly to RM119,570,000 (from RM166,999,000), supporting improved operating margins. Asset turnover increased slightly to 10.01% (from 9.88%), indicating marginally better asset utilization. Net cash from operations rose to RM548,304,000 (from RM506,867,000), reflecting stronger cash generation from core activities. However, net cash from financing remained negative at (RM400,005,000), and the net decrease in cash widened to (RM28,246,000) from (RM3,863,000), suggesting cash outflows are not fully offset by operating inflows. Inventories decreased to RM55,729,000 (from RM95,986,000), which may indicate improved inventory management or lower business activity in certain segments. Working capital appears pressured, as current assets declined to RM1,117,356,000 (from RM1,328,656,000) while current liabilities increased, contributing to the lower current ratio. | Operational efficiency in 2023 was characterized by both improvements and challenges. Asset turnover was reported at 9.88%, indicating the company generated nearly 10% of its asset base in revenue, but this figure is relatively low. Net cash from operations surged to MYR 506,867 thousand (from MYR 97,875 thousand), a substantial improvement, suggesting better working capital management or improved collections. However, inventories decreased to MYR 95,986 thousand (from MYR 203,674 thousand), which may indicate tighter inventory control or reduced business activity in certain segments. Operating expenses increased to MYR 166,999 thousand (from MYR 141,848 thousand), and the operating margin declined, pointing to rising costs. Net cash from investing was negative at (MYR 83,389 thousand), reflecting investment outflows, while net cash from financing was also negative at (MYR 427,341 thousand), indicating debt repayments or reduced external funding. The net decrease in cash was minimal at (MYR 3,863 thousand), showing improved cash flow stability. Dividend payments remained negligible. Overall, operational cash flow improved markedly, but cost control and asset utilization remain areas for attention. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage risk remains high, with the debt to equity ratio rising to 379.23%. Liquidity risk is elevated, as the current ratio fell to 61.86%, well below 1.0, indicating potential difficulty in covering short-term obligations. Interest expense increased sharply to RM380,830,000 (from RM246,570,000), and interest coverage declined to 69.11% (from 77.09%), signaling increased vulnerability to rising interest costs and reduced ability to service debt from operating income. The effective tax rate, while lower than 2023, is still extremely high at 134.57%, which continues to erode profitability. Retained earnings declined, and net profit remains negative, both of which could constrain future financial flexibility. These factors collectively point to heightened financial risk and the need for careful monitoring of liquidity and leverage. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 point to elevated risk levels. The current ratio dropped below 1 (90.83%), indicating potential liquidity stress and a risk of not meeting short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio rose to 372.61%, underscoring high leverage and increased financial risk. Interest expense increased to MYR 246,570 thousand, and interest coverage declined to 77.09% (from 81.61%), suggesting reduced ability to service debt from operating income. The effective tax rate soared to 1009.33%, which is abnormally high and may signal one-off tax items, non-deductible expenses, or deferred tax adjustments, all of which could impact future profitability. The decline in retained earnings and shareholders' equity further weakens the company’s financial buffer. Overall, the company faces significant financial risks from high leverage, weak liquidity, and volatile tax impacts. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity data for 2024 is unavailable, limiting direct assessment of capital expenditures. Net cash from operations remains strong, but persistent negative net profit and cash outflows from financing raise concerns about long-term cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments remain minimal at RM172,000, suggesting a conservative dividend policy likely aimed at preserving cash. Segment analysis shows construction operations revenue increased significantly to RM640,693,000 (from RM527,218,000), while property development revenue dropped sharply to RM30,132,000 (from RM139,090,000), indicating a strategic or market-driven shift in business focus. Toll operations and property investment revenues grew modestly, while plantation and food & beverage segments saw slight declines. Geographically, revenue remains overwhelmingly concentrated in Malaysia, with negligible contributions from other countries. Looking ahead, the company’s future performance will depend on its ability to manage high leverage, improve net profitability, and sustain operational cash flows, particularly as it pivots towards construction and infrastructure-related activities. | Looking ahead, Ekovest Berhad’s future financial performance will depend on its ability to sustain revenue growth and improve profitability. The strong increase in operating cash flow in 2023 is a positive sign for short-term liquidity and operational sustainability. However, continued negative net profit and high leverage pose challenges for long-term financial health. Investment outflows (MYR 83,389 thousand) suggest ongoing capital expenditure, which could support future growth if returns materialize. The company’s revenue is heavily concentrated in Malaysia (MYR 1,096,243 thousand out of MYR 1,116,909 thousand total), with limited geographic diversification. Segment-wise, construction operations and toll operations remain the largest contributors, with property development revenue growing significantly. Dividend payments remain minimal, indicating a focus on cash retention. To improve future performance, the company must address margin pressures, reduce leverage, and manage liquidity risks while leveraging its core segments for growth. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The company operates as a diversified conglomerate with multiple business segments, primarily generating revenue through: (1) construction operations (civil engineering, building works, project management services), (2) property development (sale of completed properties), (3) toll operations (expressway toll collection), (4) plantation (sales of plantation products and produces, including oil palm and durian), (5) food and beverages (operation of restaurants), (6) property investment (management, operation, and letting of properties, including malls and hotels), and (7) other activities (investment holding, hotel operation, renewable energy). Revenue is mainly derived from contracts with customers, recognized over time for construction contracts and hotel stays, and at a point in time for property sales, food and beverage, plantation products, and tolls. In FY2024, construction was the main revenue driver (RM640.7 million, 55.9% of total revenue), followed by toll operations (RM310.8 million, 27.1%), plantation (RM114.9 million, 10.0%), and property development/investment (RM64.3 million, 5.6%). The company also earns rental income from investment properties and ancillary services. Revenue recognition policies are tailored to each segment: construction and property development revenue is recognized over time or at point of transfer, toll revenue is recognized as tolls are charged, and sales of goods (F&B, plantation) are recognized upon delivery. | The company's primary business model is a diversified conglomerate structure with multiple revenue streams across several key segments: construction operations, toll operations (infrastructure concession), property development, plantation (agrofood and cash crops), food and beverage (restaurant operations), property investment (rental income), and other activities including hotel operations and renewable energy. Revenue is generated through: (1) construction contracts (recognized over time, accounting for RM527.0 million or 47.2% of total revenue in FY2023), (2) toll collection from expressway operations (RM287.7 million or 25.8%), (3) property development and sales of completed properties (RM139.1 million or 12.5%), (4) plantation product sales (RM118.3 million or 10.6%), (5) food and beverage sales (RM12.7 million), (6) rental income from investment properties (RM30.0 million), (7) hotel room and amenities (recognized over time), and (8) renewable energy income (from delivery of converted energy). The company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers both over time (for construction, project management, and hotel operations) and at a point in time (for property sales, F&B, plantation, renewable energy, and tolls). The business model leverages complementary businesses to create long-term shareholder value, reduce dependency on any single segment, and limit the impact of economic cycles. |
| Market Position | The company is positioned as a major player in Malaysia's construction, infrastructure, and property sectors, with a growing presence in plantations and other diversified businesses. It is described as 'one of the most respected construction players in Malaysia,' having delivered over RM8.5 billion worth of projects nationwide, and continues to secure large-scale infrastructure contracts such as the RM1.45 billion RTS Link project. In toll operations, the company operates major expressways (DUKE 1, DUKE 2, SPE) and has experienced steady growth in toll revenue, especially with the opening of the SPE Highway in November 2023. In FY2024, toll operations contributed 27.1% of total revenue, with an 18.8% increase in toll collection receipts (excluding compensation) compared to the previous year. The property development and investment segments are anchored by the EkoCheras integrated development (mall, hotel, office, serviced apartments), with the EkoCheras Mall and Innside by Meliá Hotel as key assets.

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks related to economic conditions and industry trends impacting its construction, property development, toll operations, and plantation segments. The construction sector is influenced by government infrastructure projects and private-public partnerships, with growth expected from projects like RTS Link, DUKE Phase 2A, and others. The property sector is subject to demand volatility and consumer sentiment, with ongoing efforts to monetize landbanks and launch new developments such as EkoTitiwangsa. The plantation segment is exposed to commodity price fluctuations, weather conditions affecting yields, and cyclical nature of the oil palm and durian businesses. The Group plans to diversify its business to reduce reliance on cyclical sectors and mitigate market risks. The Group also faces competition and demand changes in its various segments. Mitigation includes strategic project selection, diversification, and active market engagement. | The Group faces market risks including foreign currency risk due to transactions denominated in foreign currencies, with exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. The Group does not hedge this risk currently. Agricultural risks arise from environmental and climatic changes, commodity price fluctuations, and demand volatility, particularly in oil palm and durian assets. The seasonal nature of durian plantation requires high cash flow reserves during durian seasons. The Group actively manages working capital and secures sufficient credit facilities to meet cash flow needs. Industry trends indicate growth in construction driven by government infrastructure projects and recovery post-pandemic, but property demand is affected by high material costs and interest rates. The Group's strategic focus includes expanding and diversifying businesses to reduce dependency on core segments, mitigating cyclical market risks. The Group also monitors economic conditions and collaborates with the government to identify new projects and expedite approvals. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include challenges in construction supply chains such as unpredictable material price fluctuations and tight labor markets post-COVID-19, impacting project completion timelines (e.g., SPE delays). The Group manages operational risks through internal controls including clear delegation of responsibilities, Board Committees oversight, contract budgeting and monitoring, and quality management systems (ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, ISO 45001:2018). Health and safety risks are managed via mandatory HIRARC processes, safety committees, and design improvements. The Group also faces risks in product development and quality, particularly in plantation rehabilitation and durian production. The food and beverages segment has impairment risks on right-of-use assets. The Group maintains insurance coverage for construction-related risks and enforces anti-corruption and whistleblowing policies to mitigate operational risks. Business continuity is supported by cash flow management and alternative funding sources. | Operational risks include challenges in business operations such as the seasonal and yield variability in durian plantations, requiring rehabilitation and impacting profitability.

The Group also faces risks related to impairment of assets such as expressway concession assets and park and ride buildings, requiring significant judgment and estimates in impairment assessments. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks include liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, and agricultural risk. Liquidity risk arises from the Group's net current liabilities position and timing mismatches between cash inflows and financial obligations, especially due to tolling delays on SPE. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining optimum liquidity levels, monitoring cash flows, securing credit facilities (including RM1.24 billion unutilised credit facilities and RM1.02 billion Sukuk Murabahah Programme), asset disposals, and negotiating with financiers for debt restructuring. Credit risk is managed through credit policies, monitoring, impairment assessments, and concentration risk is noted with significant receivables from few customers. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings; sensitivity analyses indicate exposure to 100 basis points changes. Foreign currency risk exists due to transactions in foreign currencies but is not hedged given current operation levels. Agricultural risk arises from environmental, climatic changes, and commodity price fluctuations affecting biological assets; working capital and credit facilities are managed accordingly. Capital management aims to maintain optimal debt-to-equity ratios and compliance with covenants. | Financial risks include interest rate risk from floating rate borrowings and medium term notes, with sensitivity analyses indicating potential profit impact from rate changes. Credit risk arises from concentration in a few large debtors and contract assets, managed through credit evaluations, limits, collateral, and ongoing monitoring. Liquidity risk is significant due to net current liabilities position; mitigated by maintaining optimum liquidity levels, efficient working capital management, cash flow forecasting, securing and maintaining credit facilities (including unutilised credit facilities up to RM80 million and new credit facilities post-year end), asset disposals, and private placements raising RM133 million post-year end. The Group does not currently use derivatives for hedging financial risks. Financial guarantee exposure exists but is not expected to be called. The Group manages financial risks through internal controls, benchmarking, insurance, and adherence to policies. The gearing ratio remains low at 0.37 times, and the Group monitors compliance with financial covenants. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Ekovest Berhad faces economic challenges including inflationary pressures on operational costs, particularly in the plantation division, and unpredictable fluctuations in construction material prices. The Group recorded a higher loss before tax in FYE2024 compared to FYE2023, partly due to the discontinuation of financing costs capitalisation for the SPE Highway upon its commencement, delayed compensation for deferred toll rate hikes, and inability to recognise scheduled toll rates. The tolling delay of SPE caused a mismatch between cash inflows and financial obligations, impacting liquidity. The lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected cash flow and financial commitments, especially in toll operations. The Group also faces risks from environmental and climatic changes affecting agricultural biological assets, with moderated crude palm oil prices and adverse weather impacting durian production. Despite Malaysia's resilient economy and forecasted GDP growth of 4-5% in 2024, uncertainties remain in market conditions and cost pressures. The Group manages liquidity risk through active cash flow monitoring, securing new credit facilities, asset disposals, and exploring new business areas to reduce reliance on cyclical sectors. Concentration risk exists with significant credit exposure to a few debtors. Overall, economic uncertainties include inflation, cost volatility, delayed government compensations, pandemic aftereffects, and agricultural commodity price fluctuations that could impact revenue and profitability. | Ekovest Berhad faces several economic challenges and uncertainties as outlined in the 2023 annual report. The Group acknowledges the cyclical nature and risk exposure of its principal activities, with surprise events like the COVID-19 pandemic impacting business resilience. Inflationary pressures have affected operational costs, particularly in the plantation division, where moderated crude palm oil prices and adverse weather conditions have also impacted production volumes and quality. The property sector experienced waning demand, high material costs, and increased interest rates, negatively affecting property demand and sales, although government incentives have somewhat mitigated this. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to transactions in multiple currencies, with exchange rate fluctuations potentially impacting profits. Liquidity risk is managed actively, but the Group reported a net current liabilities position as of 30 June 2023, requiring measures such as private placements, asset disposals, and securing new credit facilities to strengthen cash flow. The construction sector faces challenges from unpredictable material price fluctuations and a tight labor market post-pandemic. Additionally, the Group's toll operations were financially impacted by reduced toll collections during movement control orders, creating a financial gap that requires stakeholder support to realign. The Group also faces risks related to interest rate fluctuations affecting borrowings and medium-term notes. Overall, economic uncertainties include inflation, cost pressures, subdued consumer sentiment, and the need to adapt to post-pandemic lifestyle and spending patterns, all of which could impact revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The 2024 annual report does not explicitly address competitive pressures or market competition faced by Ekovest Berhad. There is no specific mention of threats from established industry players, new disruptive entrants, technological disruption, or industry dynamics challenging the company's market position. | Ekovest Berhad operates in a competitive environment with pressures from established industry players and evolving market dynamics. The Group is actively pursuing new infrastructure projects and engaging with the Government to secure contracts such as the Johor Bahru to Singapore Rapid Transit System Link and DUKE Phase 2A to replenish its construction order book. The construction industry is expected to grow steadily, driven by government infrastructure projects, but challenges such as supply chain disruptions, fluctuating material prices, and labor shortages post-pandemic have affected project progress. The Group is transforming into a larger conglomerate with diversified businesses to reduce dependency on core segments and enhance competitiveness. In the plantation and agro-food sector, PLS Plantations Berhad is transitioning from traditional oil palm plantations to diversified upstream and downstream activities, including durian products, facing challenges in market access, particularly in China, and recalibrating strategies to collaborate with established players. The Group also faces risks from technological and market disruptions, requiring continuous rejuvenation of management teams and strategic investments, including international property development ventures, to maintain and grow its market position. The toll operations segment must maintain high service standards to retain and grow traffic volumes amid new expressway openings and integration with other highways. Competitive threats include the need to manage financial covenants and liquidity amid industry-wide impacts from the pandemic and regulatory changes. The Group's strategic focus on a hybrid business model aims to mitigate economic cycles and improve margins, but it must navigate ongoing industry dynamics and competitive pressures to sustain growth. |
