# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Tenaga Nasional Berhad's revenue increased steadily from RM50,867.7 million in 2022 to RM53,066.9 million in 2023 and further to RM56,737.1 million in 2024, reflecting a consistent upward trend. Gross margin improved significantly from a negative (16.12%) in 2022, to 3.91% in 2023, and reached 9.00% in 2024, indicating a strong recovery in profitability at the gross level. By product/service, electricity remained the dominant contributor, rising from RM49,702.3 million in 2022 to RM51,713.2 million in 2023 and RM54,545.7 million in 2024. Other segments such as goods and services also grew from RM621.8 million in 2022 to RM1,366.8 million in 2024. Geographically, Malaysia was the primary market, with revenue of RM52,145.2 million in 2024, compared to RM55,205.8 million in 2023 and RM46,879.7 million (Peninsular Malaysia) in 2022, while international contributions remained relatively minor. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 18.50% in 2022 to 13.86% in 2023, before improving to 15.37% in 2024. Operating income followed a similar pattern, decreasing from RM9,409.5 million in 2022 to RM7,356.9 million in 2023, then rising to RM8,720.1 million in 2024, while revenue increased each year. Operating expenses were RM64,612.1 million in 2022, dropping sharply to RM7,380.9 million in 2023 and RM7,328.2 million in 2024, indicating substantial cost control and efficiency improvements after 2022. The combination of rising revenue and stabilized operating expenses in 2023 and 2024 contributed to the recovery in operating margin and overall profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased significantly from 33.49% in 2022 to 22.82% in 2023 and further to 18.66% in 2024, which positively impacted net profit, as seen in the increase from RM3,463.3 million in 2022 to RM4,729.6 million in 2024.

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Tenaga Nasional Berhad demonstrated stable financial health. Total assets increased marginally to RM205,056.1 million from RM204,743.6 million in 2023, while total liabilities decreased to RM142,486.4 million from RM143,660.9 million, indicating a slight deleveraging. Shareholders' equity rose to RM62,569.7 million (from RM61,082.7 million), and retained earnings increased to RM54,633.8 million, reflecting profit retention. The current ratio declined to 118.66% (from 123.78%), suggesting a modest reduction in short-term liquidity, but it remains above 100%, indicating adequate coverage of current liabilities. Debt to equity improved to 227.72% (from 235.19%), showing a slight reduction in leverage, though the capital structure remains debt-heavy. Overall, the company maintained a strong asset base, improved equity position, and slightly reduced financial leverage in 2024. | In 2023, Tenaga Nasional Berhad maintained a stable financial position. Total assets stood at RM204,743.6 million, marginally lower than 2022, while total liabilities decreased to RM143,660.9 million. Shareholders' equity increased slightly to RM61,082.7 million, and retained earnings rose to RM53,008.9 million, indicating ongoing profit retention. The current ratio remained unchanged at 123.78%, suggesting adequate short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved slightly to 235.19% from 237.76%, reflecting a modest reduction in leverage. The capital structure remains heavily debt-weighted, but the incremental improvement in equity and reduction in liabilities point to a cautious strengthening of the balance sheet. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved significantly in 2024. Revenue grew to RM56,737.1 million (up from RM53,066.9 million), and gross profit rose sharply to RM5,107.0 million (from RM3,076.8 million). Gross margin more than doubled to 9.00% (from 3.91%), indicating better cost management or pricing. Operating income increased to RM8,720.1 million, with operating margin rising to 15.37% (from 13.86%). Net profit nearly doubled to RM4,729.6 million, and net profit margin improved to 8.34% (from 4.91%). Return on equity (ROE) increased to 7.65% (from 4.27%), and return on assets (ROA) to 2.31% (from 1.27%), reflecting stronger earnings generation from both equity and assets. The effective tax rate decreased to 18.66% (from 22.82%), supporting net profitability. Overall, 2024 saw marked improvements in revenue, margins, and returns, indicating high earnings quality. | Profitability in 2023 showed mixed signals. Revenue increased to RM53,066.9 million from RM50,867.7 million, but cost of goods sold fell sharply, resulting in a positive gross profit of RM3,076.8 million versus a negative RM8,202.3 million in 2022. Gross margin improved to 3.91% from -16.12%, indicating a significant turnaround in core profitability. However, operating income and net profit both declined to RM7,356.9 million and RM2,603.6 million, respectively. Operating margin decreased to 13.86% (from 18.50%), and net profit margin fell to 4.91% (from 6.81%), reflecting higher operating expenses and lower earnings quality. Return on equity (4.27%) and return on assets (1.27%) were moderate, with the former indicating limited value creation for shareholders. The effective tax rate dropped to 22.82% from 33.49%, supporting net profit but not offsetting the overall margin compression. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased only slightly to RM51,630.1 million (from RM50,990.1 million), while revenue growth outpaced cost increases, leading to higher gross profit. Operating expenses were marginally lower at RM7,328.2 million (from RM7,380.9 million), reflecting effective cost control. Asset turnover improved to 27.69% (from 25.84%), indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations declined to RM22,378.3 million (from RM32,243.4 million), suggesting less cash conversion from earnings, possibly due to working capital changes or timing effects. Inventories decreased to RM2,543.6 million (from RM2,758.0 million), indicating efficient inventory management. However, net cash from investing was more negative at RM(11,337.4) million (from RM(5,784.7) million), suggesting increased capital expenditure or investments. Net cash from financing remained negative at RM(13,096.4) million, and dividends paid increased to RM3,073.7 million. The net decrease in cash of RM(2,055.5) million contrasts with a net increase in 2023, highlighting higher investment outflows and dividend payments. | Operational efficiency in 2023 was characterized by improved cost control at the gross profit level but higher operating expenses. The asset turnover ratio was 25.84%, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations remained robust at RM32,243.4 million, unchanged from 2022, supporting strong cash generation. Working capital remained stable, with current assets and liabilities unchanged. However, operating expenses were significantly lower at RM7,380.9 million compared to RM64,612.1 million in 2022, suggesting a reclassification or one-off adjustment. Net cash from investing was negative at RM5,784.7 million, indicating ongoing investment activity, while net cash from financing was negative at RM13,311.8 million, reflecting debt repayments or dividend payouts. The net increase in cash was RM13,146.9 million, and dividends paid increased to RM2,537.5 million, demonstrating continued shareholder returns. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show moderate improvement. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 227.72% (from 235.19%), indicating slightly lower leverage, though the company remains highly leveraged. Interest expense fell to RM4,097.8 million (from RM4,331.1 million), and interest coverage improved to 212.80% (from 169.86%), suggesting enhanced ability to service debt. The current ratio declined to 118.66% (from 123.78%), but still indicates sufficient liquidity. The effective tax rate dropped to 18.66% (from 22.82%), which may reflect tax incentives or changes in profit mix. The net decrease in cash and higher investment outflows could signal potential liquidity pressure if sustained, especially with increased dividend payouts. No immediate red flags are present, but the high leverage and declining operational cash flow warrant close monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 showed slight improvement but remain areas for monitoring. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 235.19%, and total liabilities declined, but leverage remains high. The current ratio of 123.78% suggests sufficient liquidity to cover short-term obligations. Interest expense was stable at RM4,331.1 million, but interest coverage weakened to 169.86% from 216.64%, indicating reduced buffer for debt servicing. The effective tax rate dropped significantly, which may not be sustainable. No material changes in tax policy or extraordinary items are evident. The company’s high leverage and declining interest coverage are early warning signs that warrant close attention, especially if profitability continues to compress. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Tenaga Nasional Berhad's increased investment outflows in 2024 (net cash from investing at RM(11,337.4) million) suggest ongoing capital projects or expansion, which could support future growth if returns materialize. The company maintained strong dividend payments (RM3,073.7 million), indicating confidence in cash flow sustainability, though the net decrease in cash highlights the need for careful liquidity management. Revenue growth was driven primarily by electricity and goods/services, with electricity revenue rising to RM54,545.7 million. Geographically, Malaysia remains the dominant market, though revenue from Malaysia declined to RM52,145.2 million (from RM55,205.8 million), partially offset by increases in the UK and insurance contract revenue. The improved profitability and margins provide a solid foundation, but future performance will depend on the success of investment activities, continued cost control, and the ability to maintain or grow cash flows amid high leverage and capital requirements. | Looking ahead, Tenaga Nasional Berhad’s financial outlook is shaped by stable operating cash flows and ongoing investment activity. The unchanged net cash from operations and continued negative investing cash flow suggest sustained capital expenditure, likely supporting future growth. Dividend payouts increased, indicating management’s confidence in cash flow sustainability. Revenue diversification improved, with international revenue (United Kingdom, Kuwait, Republic of Ireland, Australia, and others) totaling over RM1,500 million, compared to a more Malaysia-centric profile in 2022. This geographic expansion may provide new growth avenues. However, persistent high leverage and declining margins could constrain future profitability unless operational efficiency and cost control are further enhanced. Continued focus on debt management and margin improvement will be critical for long-term financial health. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Market risks include exposure to foreign currency risk primarily from USD, JPY, and GBP affecting financial positions and cash flows. The Group hedges at least 50% of known foreign currency exposure up to 12 months using forward exchange contracts and foreign currency floats. Interest rate risk arises from variable rate borrowings impacting cash flows, while fixed rate instruments have minimal fair value risk.
