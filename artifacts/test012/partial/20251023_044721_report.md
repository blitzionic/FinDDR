## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Gas Malaysia Berhad demonstrated a solid financial position. Total assets increased to MYR 3,674,337 thousand from MYR 3,206,950 thousand in 2023, reflecting asset growth. Total liabilities also rose to MYR 2,168,168 thousand (2023: MYR 1,839,075 thousand), with both current and non-current liabilities increasing. Shareholders' equity improved to MYR 1,506,169 thousand (2023: MYR 1,367,875 thousand), supported by higher retained earnings (MYR 868,177 thousand vs. MYR 726,606 thousand). The current ratio improved to 95.86% (2023: 89.76%), indicating slightly better short-term liquidity, though it remains below 1.0, suggesting tight liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased to 143.95% (2023: 134.45%), indicating a higher reliance on debt financing and a more leveraged capital structure. Overall, the company’s financial health is stable with growing assets and equity, but the rising leverage and sub-1.0 current ratio warrant monitoring. | In 2023, Gas Malaysia Berhad demonstrated a solid financial position. Total assets increased to MYR 3,206,950 thousand from MYR 3,147,131 thousand in 2022, indicating asset growth. Shareholders' equity rose to MYR 1,367,875 thousand (from MYR 1,278,335 thousand), reflecting retained earnings growth and overall strengthening of the capital base. Total liabilities decreased to MYR 1,839,075 thousand (from MYR 1,868,796 thousand), with both current and non-current liabilities showing slight reductions and increases, respectively. The current ratio was 89.76%, marginally lower than 2022's 91.04%, suggesting a slight decrease in short-term liquidity but still close to parity. Debt to equity improved to 134.45% (from 146.19%), indicating a more conservative capital structure and reduced leverage. Retained earnings increased significantly to MYR 726,606 thousand (from MYR 633,135 thousand), supporting future reinvestment or dividend capacity. Overall, the company maintained a healthy balance sheet with improved equity and reduced leverage. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved in 2024 despite a slight decrease in revenue to MYR 8,044,885 thousand (2023: MYR 8,078,921 thousand). Gross profit rose to MYR 690,348 thousand (2023: MYR 593,680 thousand), and operating income increased to MYR 582,468 thousand (2023: MYR 506,624 thousand). Net profit climbed to MYR 441,385 thousand (2023: MYR 383,399 thousand). Margins improved across the board: gross margin rose to 8.58% (2023: 7.35%), operating margin to 7.24% (2023: 6.27%), and net profit margin to 5.49% (2023: 4.75%). Return on equity increased to 30.72% (2023: 28.98%), and return on assets to 12.83% (2023: 12.07%), indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficiency. The effective tax rate was stable at 25.01%. Overall, the company delivered stronger profitability and higher returns on both equity and assets in 2024. | Profitability in 2023 remained robust but showed some margin compression. Revenue grew to MYR 8,078,921 thousand (up from MYR 7,649,400 thousand), but gross profit declined to MYR 593,680 thousand (from MYR 617,876 thousand), reflecting higher cost of goods sold. Gross margin narrowed to 7.35% (from 8.08%), and operating margin decreased to 6.27% (from 7.07%), indicating increased operating costs. Net profit was MYR 383,399 thousand, slightly lower than 2022's MYR 389,543 thousand, with net profit margin at 4.75% (down from 5.09%). Return on equity was strong at 28.98%, and return on assets was 12.07%, both indicating efficient use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate decreased to 25.40% (from 28.12%), supporting net earnings. Overall, while revenue increased, margin pressures led to slightly lower net profit, but returns on equity and assets remained attractive. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2024. Cost of goods sold decreased to MYR 7,354,537 thousand (2023: MYR 7,485,241 thousand), supporting higher gross profit despite lower revenue. Operating expenses increased to MYR 113,704 thousand (2023: MYR 91,200 thousand), but this was offset by the larger increase in gross profit. Asset turnover declined to 233.82% (2023: 254.29%), indicating less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations was stable at MYR 483,160 thousand (2023: MYR 475,233 thousand), while net cash used in investing increased to MYR (216,799) thousand (2023: MYR (160,646) thousand), suggesting higher capital expenditure. Net cash from financing remained steady at MYR (214,148) thousand. The net increase in cash was lower at MYR 52,213 thousand (2023: MYR 100,495 thousand), reflecting higher investment outflows. Working capital improved as current assets outpaced current liabilities growth. Overall, the company maintained strong cash generation from operations but saw reduced asset turnover and higher investment outflows. | Operational efficiency in 2023 was mixed. Asset turnover was high at 254.29%, indicating strong utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations declined to MYR 475,233 thousand (from MYR 626,081 thousand), suggesting less cash conversion from earnings, possibly due to working capital changes. Operating expenses increased to MYR 91,200 thousand (from MYR 80,008 thousand), reflecting higher cost pressures. Net cash from investing was negative at MYR (160,646) thousand (compared to a positive MYR 264,684 thousand in 2022), indicating increased investment activity. Net cash from financing was less negative at MYR (214,092) thousand (vs. MYR (342,415) thousand), and dividends paid decreased to MYR (289,928) thousand (from MYR (322,165) thousand), suggesting a more conservative payout. The net increase in cash was positive at MYR 100,495 thousand, though much lower than the prior year. Overall, the company maintained positive cash flow, but operational cash generation and cost control weakened compared to 2022. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 highlight increased leverage and continued liquidity constraints. The debt to equity ratio rose to 143.95% (2023: 134.45%), indicating higher financial leverage. The current ratio improved to 95.86% but remains below 1.0, signaling ongoing short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense increased to MYR 13,585 thousand (2023: MYR 11,085 thousand), but interest coverage remained robust at 4,287.58% (2023: 4,570.36%), suggesting strong ability to service debt. The effective tax rate was stable at 25.01%, with no significant tax risk. The increase in non-current liabilities (to MYR 534,843 thousand from MYR 315,048 thousand) may indicate new long-term borrowings or obligations. No inventory data is available, limiting assessment of inventory risk. Overall, while the company’s interest coverage is strong, the rising leverage and suboptimal liquidity position are early warning signs that should be monitored. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 generally improved. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 134.45% (from 146.19%), reflecting lower leverage. The current ratio was stable at 89.76%, only slightly below the prior year, indicating adequate but not excessive liquidity. Interest coverage remained very strong at 4570.36%, though lower than 2022's 5310.77%, suggesting ample ability to service debt. The effective tax rate decreased to 25.40% (from 28.12%), reducing tax burden risk. No significant increase in non-current liabilities was observed, and the company continued to generate positive operating cash flow. However, the decline in operating cash flow and margin compression could be early warning signs of operational or market pressures. Overall, financial risk remains well managed, but continued monitoring of cash flow and margins is warranted. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Gas Malaysia Berhad’s increased investment outflows in 2024 (net cash from investing: MYR (216,799) thousand vs. MYR (160,646) thousand in 2023) suggest ongoing capital expenditure, potentially supporting future growth. Dividend payments increased to MYR (299,814) thousand (2023: MYR (289,928) thousand), indicating a continued commitment to shareholder returns, though this may constrain retained cash. Cash flow from operations remains strong and stable, supporting sustainability. Revenue remains highly concentrated in Malaysia and in Natural Gas & LPG, with no diversification evident in 2024, which may expose the company to sector or geographic risks. The company’s ability to maintain or grow profitability will depend on continued operational efficiency and prudent management of leverage and liquidity. If investment leads to revenue or margin growth, future performance could improve, but the current high leverage and tight liquidity require careful monitoring. | Looking ahead, Gas Malaysia Berhad's increased investment outflows in 2023 (net cash from investing: MYR (160,646) thousand) suggest ongoing capital expenditure, potentially supporting future growth. The company maintained a positive net cash position and reduced dividend payout, which may indicate a focus on reinvestment or liquidity preservation. Revenue growth was driven entirely by the Malaysian market, with natural gas and LPG sales dominating, and minimal diversification in product or geography. Sustained high asset turnover and strong returns on equity and assets provide a solid foundation for future performance, but margin compression and lower operating cash flow highlight the need for improved cost control and working capital management. If investment translates into operational improvements or new revenue streams, future performance could strengthen. However, continued margin pressure and cash flow trends should be closely monitored. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Gas Malaysia faces market risks including regulatory risks such as potential loss of licences, changes to government or regulatory policies, and government intervention in retail gas pricing. These risks could negatively impact the Group's profitability and ability to continue operations.
