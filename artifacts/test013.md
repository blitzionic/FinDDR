# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | UOA Development Bhd's revenue increased from RM451,653,000 in 2022 to RM399,392,000 in 2023, then rebounded sharply to RM545,698,000 in 2024. Gross margin declined each year, from 47.24% in 2022 to 43.48% in 2023 and further to 35.77% in 2024, indicating rising direct costs relative to revenue. Revenue is overwhelmingly driven by property development (RM545,645,000 in 2024, RM397,883,000 in 2023, RM451,653,000 in 2022), with construction contributing RM53,000 in 2024 and RM1,509,000 in 2023. All revenue is generated in Malaysia across all years. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin was 0.00% in 2022, turned negative to (0.02%) in 2023, and is not available for 2024. Operating income dropped from RM11,397,000 in 2022 to a loss of (RM94,870,000) in 2023, with 2024 data not provided. In 2023, operating expenses rose to RM268,538,000 from RM201,965,000 in 2022, outpacing gross profit and leading to negative operating income, suggesting cost management challenges. Despite higher revenue in 2024, the lack of operating income data and declining gross margin point to potential ongoing efficiency issues. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 22.44% in 2022 to 22.26% in 2023, then rose further to 25.10% in 2024, which may have reduced net profit growth in the latest year. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, UOA Development Bhd demonstrated a robust financial position. Total assets increased to RM6,388,657,000 from RM6,081,074,000 in 2023, reflecting asset growth. Total liabilities rose modestly to RM553,565,000 (from RM491,863,000), but the increase in shareholders' equity to RM5,661,878,000 (from RM5,413,096,000) maintained a strong capital base. The current ratio remained extremely high at 743.91%, indicating ample liquidity and a significant buffer to cover short-term obligations. Debt to equity was low at 9.78%, only slightly higher than the previous year, suggesting a conservative capital structure with minimal reliance on debt. Retained earnings also increased, supporting internal funding capacity. Overall, the company’s balance sheet in 2024 reflects high liquidity, low leverage, and strong equity capitalization. | In 2023, UOA Development Bhd maintained a strong financial position, with total assets of RM6,081,074,000 and total liabilities of RM491,863,000, resulting in a low debt to equity ratio of 9.09%. Shareholders' equity stood at RM5,413,096,000, indicating a solid capital base. The current ratio was exceptionally high at 797.11%, reflecting ample liquidity and a strong ability to meet short-term obligations. Retained earnings decreased to RM2,334,044,000 from RM2,781,398,000 in 2022, mainly due to a significant dividend payout. Non-current assets increased slightly, while current assets and inventories declined marginally, suggesting a shift in asset composition but continued balance sheet strength. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved in absolute terms in 2024, with revenue rising sharply to RM545,698,000 from RM399,392,000 in 2023. Gross profit also increased to RM195,214,000 (from RM173,668,000). However, gross margin declined to 35.77% from 43.48%, indicating higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Net profit increased to RM294,740,000 (from RM286,406,000), but the net profit margin fell to 54.01% from 71.71%, reflecting margin compression despite higher earnings. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) both improved slightly to 5.32% and 4.73%, respectively, indicating better utilization of equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased to 25.10% (from 22.26%), which may have slightly dampened net profitability. Overall, while earnings quality remains high, margin pressures are evident. | Profitability in 2023 showed mixed signals. Revenue declined to RM399,392,000 from RM451,653,000 in 2022, and gross profit fell to RM173,668,000. Gross margin narrowed to 43.48% from 47.24%. Operating income turned negative at (RM94,870,000), and the operating margin was (0.02%), indicating higher operating expenses (RM268,538,000) relative to gross profit. Despite this, net profit increased to RM286,406,000, and net profit margin rose sharply to 71.71% from 49.32%, driven by a higher income before taxes and a stable effective tax rate (22.26%). Return on equity (5.14%) and return on assets (4.57%) were positive, reflecting reasonable returns on capital. The quality of earnings is affected by the disconnect between operating and net profit, suggesting the presence of significant non-operating income or one-off items. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 showed mixed signals. Asset turnover improved to 8.75% from 6.37%, indicating better revenue generation from assets. However, net cash from operations dropped significantly to RM26,409,000 from RM265,932,000, suggesting weaker cash conversion from earnings. Inventory levels increased slightly, but working capital remained strong given the high current ratio. Net cash from investing turned negative (RM-27,531,000), indicating increased investment activity, while net cash from financing was less negative at RM-44,829,000 (vs. RM-614,509,000), reflecting reduced outflows, possibly due to lower dividends (RM-23,644,000 vs. RM-609,243,000). The net decrease in cash was smaller than in 2023. Overall, while revenue and asset utilization improved, cash flow from operations weakened, warranting attention. | Operational efficiency weakened in 2023. Revenue and gross profit both declined, and operating expenses increased substantially, leading to negative operating income. Asset turnover was 6.37%, indicating moderate utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations dropped to RM265,932,000 from RM489,190,000, reflecting reduced cash generation from core activities. Working capital remained robust, as evidenced by the high current ratio. Cash flow from investing turned positive (RM31,324,000), while cash flow from financing was significantly negative (RM614,509,000), mainly due to a large dividend payout (RM609,243,000). The net decrease in cash was RM317,253,000, highlighting cash outflows exceeding inflows for the year. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk remains low in 2024. Leverage is minimal, with a debt to equity ratio of 9.78%. Liquidity risk is negligible given the very high current ratio (743.91%). Interest expense is extremely low (RM210,000), and the company’s ability to service debt is not in question, though interest coverage is not available for 2024. The effective tax rate increased to 25.10%, which could impact future net profits. The increase in total liabilities is moderate and well-covered by equity. No significant short-term or long-term financial risks are apparent, but the sharp drop in operating cash flow could be an early warning sign if it persists. | Financial risk remained low in 2023. The debt to equity ratio was stable at 9.09%, and interest expense was minimal (RM131,000). The current ratio of 797.11% indicates very low liquidity risk. The effective tax rate was stable at 22.26%. However, the interest coverage ratio was negative at (72.42%), reflecting negative operating income and raising concerns about the sustainability of earnings from operations. The significant reduction in retained earnings and large dividend payout could constrain future internal funding. No material increase in leverage or tax rate was observed, but the negative operating margin and interest coverage warrant close monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, UOA Development Bhd’s increased investment outflows in 2024 suggest a focus on growth or asset expansion. The substantial increase in revenue, especially from property development (RM545,645,000), and continued exclusive focus on the Malaysian market, indicate strong domestic demand. The reduction in dividend payments may signal a more conservative cash management or a shift toward reinvestment. However, the sharp decline in operating cash flow raises questions about the sustainability of earnings and cash generation. If operational cash flow does not recover, future dividend capacity and investment funding could be constrained. Overall, the company is well-positioned for growth, but maintaining strong cash flows will be critical for sustaining performance. | Looking ahead, UOA Development Bhd's strong balance sheet and low leverage provide a solid foundation, but the sustainability of high net profit is questionable given negative operating income. The large dividend payout in 2023 may not be sustainable if operating performance does not improve. Investment activity was limited, with a small net inflow from investing activities. Revenue remains concentrated in property development (RM397,883,000 out of RM399,392,000 total), and all revenue was generated in Malaysia, indicating limited diversification. Future performance will depend on restoring operating profitability, maintaining cash flow from operations, and prudent capital allocation. Continued focus on cost control and exploring new revenue streams or markets could support future growth. |
