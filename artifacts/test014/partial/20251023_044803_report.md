# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Bayan Resources Tbk.'s revenue declined from USD 4,703,622,038 in 2022 to USD 3,581,375,403 in 2023 and further to USD 3,446,214,954 in 2024, indicating a consistent downward trend. Gross margin also deteriorated significantly, dropping from 67.18% in 2022 to 46.47% in 2023 and then to 38.67% in 2024. The company's revenue is overwhelmingly derived from coal, with coal revenue at USD 3,425,060,528 in 2024, USD 3,572,081,723 in 2023, and USD 4,692,765,884 in 2022, while non-coal revenue remains minimal (USD 21,154,426 in 2024). Geographically, the Philippines and China each contributed 26.81% and 20.21% of 2024 revenue, respectively, with Indonesia (Domestic and DMO) included in 90% of total sales in both 2023 and 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin decreased from 44.88% in 2023 to 35.19% in 2024, reflecting a decline in operating efficiency. Operating income fell from USD 1,607,174,098 in 2023 to USD 1,212,732,956 in 2024, while revenue also decreased over the same period. Operating expenses increased from USD 57,049,163 in 2023 to USD 120,052,540 in 2024, indicating rising cost pressures. The combination of declining revenue, shrinking gross and operating margins, and higher operating expenses suggests that cost management has become more challenging, negatively impacting overall profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained stable at 21.75% in 2024 and 21.64% in 2023, compared to a negative effective tax rate of (21.86%) in 2022, which likely reflects a one-off tax benefit or reversal in 2022. No explicit non-recurring items are listed in the provided data. There are no external factors affecting profitability explicitly mentioned in the financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Bayan Resources Tbk. demonstrated a solid financial position. Total assets increased to $3,521,455,934 from $3,444,319,816 in 2023, driven by a notable rise in non-current assets ($1,755,892,105 vs. $1,543,125,701), while current assets declined ($1,765,563,829 vs. $1,901,194,115). Total liabilities decreased significantly to $1,207,613,523 from $1,465,501,614, with both current and non-current liabilities showing reductions. Shareholders' equity strengthened, rising to $2,313,842,411 from $1,978,818,202, and retained earnings also increased. The current ratio improved to 164.04% (from 142.03%), indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio fell to 52.19% (from 74.06%), reflecting a more conservative capital structure and reduced leverage. Overall, the company’s balance sheet health improved, with lower liabilities, higher equity, and robust liquidity. | In 2023, PT Bayan Resources Tbk. demonstrated a solid financial position, with total assets of USD 3,444,319,816 and total liabilities of USD 1,465,501,614, resulting in shareholders' equity of USD 1,978,818,202. The current ratio improved to 142.03% from 131.06% in 2022, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity and a strong ability to cover current obligations. The debt to equity ratio decreased significantly to 74.06% from 97.74%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with reduced reliance on debt financing. Retained earnings remained robust at USD 1,681,336,866, though slightly lower than the previous year, likely due to high dividend payouts. Overall, the company maintained a healthy balance sheet with improved liquidity and lower leverage in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability declined in 2024 compared to 2023. Revenue decreased to $3,446,214,954 from $3,581,375,403. Gross profit fell to $1,332,785,498 (from $1,664,223,263), and all major profit margins contracted: gross margin to 38.67% (from 46.47%), operating margin to 35.19% (from 44.88%), and net profit margin to 27.37% (from 35.73%). Net profit dropped to $943,375,066 (from $1,279,580,842). Return on equity and assets also declined, to 43.95% and 27.09% respectively (from 64.40% and 34.63%). Operating expenses more than doubled, and cost of goods sold increased, further pressuring margins. The effective tax rate remained stable at 21.75%. Overall, while still profitable, the company experienced margin compression and lower earnings quality in 2024. | Profitability declined in 2023 compared to 2022, with revenue dropping from USD 4,703,622,038 to USD 3,581,375,403. Gross profit fell sharply to USD 1,664,223,263, and net profit decreased to USD 1,279,580,842. Margins contracted: gross margin dropped from 67.18% to 46.47%, and net profit margin from 48.93% to 35.73%. Despite these declines, profitability ratios remained strong, with a return on equity of 64.40% and return on assets of 34.63%. The effective tax rate was stable at 21.64%. The company’s earnings quality remains high, but the significant margin compression and lower absolute profits signal a more challenging operating environment in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2024. Asset turnover improved slightly to 98.95% (from 96.93%), indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased significantly to $1,059,843,624 (from $731,403,991), suggesting improved cash generation despite lower profits. Inventory levels rose modestly, but working capital management appears effective given the higher current ratio. Operating expenses increased sharply, which negatively impacted operating efficiency. Net cash used in investing was lower at $(166,510,975) compared to $(205,173,499), and net cash outflows from financing activities decreased, reflecting lower dividend payments and possibly reduced debt repayments. The company achieved a positive net increase in cash ($13,896,506) versus a large outflow in 2023, indicating improved cash flow management. | Operational efficiency weakened in 2023. Cost of goods sold increased to USD 1,917,152,140 despite lower revenues, indicating cost pressures. Asset turnover was 96.93%, suggesting effective use of assets, but net cash from operations dropped substantially from USD 2,129,632,026 in 2022 to USD 731,403,991, reflecting reduced cash generation from core activities. Inventories rose markedly to USD 319,063,755, which may indicate slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. Net cash from investing was a moderate outflow at USD (205,173,499), while net cash from financing was a significant outflow at USD (1,447,235,216), primarily due to consistent dividend payments of USD (1,000,000,050). The net decrease in cash of USD (921,004,724) highlights pressure on liquidity from both reduced operating cash flow and high financing outflows. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators improved in 2024. The debt to equity ratio dropped to 52.19%, and total liabilities decreased, reducing leverage risk. The current ratio rose to 164.04%, enhancing liquidity. Interest coverage, while still very high at 6,798.50%, declined from 24,239.28% due to higher interest expense and lower operating income, but remains well above risk thresholds. The effective tax rate was stable at 21.75%. No significant changes in tax policy or geographic revenue concentration were observed. The reduction in liabilities and strong liquidity position mitigate short-term financial risks, though declining profitability and rising operating expenses warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023. The current ratio increased to 142.03%, and the debt to equity ratio fell to 74.06%, both pointing to lower liquidity and solvency risk. Interest coverage was extremely high at 24,239.28%, indicating negligible risk from interest obligations. The effective tax rate remained stable at 21.64%. However, the sharp decline in operating cash flow and the large net cash outflow raise early warning signals regarding cash flow sustainability, especially if profitability continues to decline. The increase in inventories could also signal potential operational or market risks if not managed carefully. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, PT Bayan Resources Tbk. is positioned for financial stability but faces profitability headwinds. Investment outflows decreased, suggesting a more cautious approach to capital expenditures. Cash flow from operations is strong and dividend payments, while still substantial at $800,000,040, were reduced from the prior year, supporting cash retention. The company’s improved liquidity and lower leverage provide a buffer for future uncertainties. However, declining revenue, margin compression, and rising operating costs could pressure future earnings. The revenue mix remains heavily concentrated in coal and in a few geographic regions, with non-coal revenue still minimal. Sustaining cash flow and profitability will depend on cost control, potential diversification, and maintaining operational efficiency. | Looking ahead, the company’s continued high dividend payout (USD 1,000,000,050) and significant net cash outflows from financing suggest a strong commitment to shareholder returns, but may constrain future reinvestment. Investment outflows increased slightly, indicating ongoing but moderate capital expenditure. The sharp drop in operating cash flow and profitability, if persistent, could challenge the sustainability of current dividend levels and may require a reassessment of capital allocation. The company remains heavily reliant on coal (over 99% of revenue), with geographic concentration in Asia (notably the Philippines, China, and India). Any adverse developments in these markets or in coal demand/pricing could materially impact future performance. Maintaining operational efficiency and managing cost pressures will be critical for sustaining financial health. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The company's primary business model is centered on coal mining, trading, and related services. It operates as a holding company with subsidiaries engaged in coal mining, mining services, and supporting activities such as the management of special coal terminals and seaport/river port services. The main revenue streams are from the sale of coal (both domestically and internationally), coal transshipment services, and other mining-related services. In 2024, approximately US$3.4 billion in revenue was generated, with 99.4% (US$3,425.1 million) from coal sales and the remainder from non-coal services (US$21.2 million). Revenue is recognized primarily at the point in time when coal is delivered to customers, and over time for services. The company also invests in infrastructure (e.g., coal terminals, haul roads, barge loading facilities) to support its mining and logistics operations. Its key product is low calorific value (CV) coal (3,800–4,500 kcal/kg GAR), which accounted for 84.1% of revenue in 2024. The company has long-term supply contracts with major power producers in Asia and maintains a diversified customer base across several countries. | The company's primary business model is centered on coal mining, trading, and related infrastructure services. It operates as a holding company, with subsidiaries engaged in coal mining, mining services, and supporting activities. Revenue is primarily generated from the sale of coal, both domestically and internationally, as well as from coal transshipment and terminal management services. In 2023, coal sales accounted for the vast majority of revenue (US$3,572.1 million out of US$3,581.4 million total revenue), with non-coal services (mainly coal transshipment) contributing a minor portion (US$9.3 million). Revenue is recognized at the point of transfer of goods (coal sales) or over time (services). The company also manages special coal terminals and provides seaport and river port services. Over 65% of coal sales are under long-term contracts, reducing exposure to spot market volatility. The company supports its mining operations with significant infrastructure investments, including coal hauling roads, barge loading facilities, and terminals, primarily at the Tabang project. Key target markets include the Philippines, Korea, China, India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. |
| Market Position | The company is a major player in the seaborne thermal coal market, particularly in the low calorific value (CV) segment. In 2024, it sold 56.2 million MT of coal, with 23.0% of sales to the Indonesian domestic market and the rest exported mainly to the Philippines (26.81%), China (20.21%), India (8.38%), Malaysia (6.82%), and Vietnam (5.58%). These six countries accounted for 90% of total sales. The company is recognized for its excellent coal specifications, quality management, and timely supply, which have allowed it to outperform other mines in the low-CV segment despite market challenges. It has expanded its market share in China (from 8.45% to 20.21% of its sales portfolio) and maintains strong partnerships with major buyers such as Aboitiz Power, San Miguel, VAPCO, TNBF, and SEIL. The company is positioned as a market leader in the low-CV coal export market in Asia, supported by a large reserve base, low cost structure, and robust infrastructure. However, specific global or regional market share percentages are not provided in the context. | The company is a leading player in the Indonesian and regional seaborne thermal coal market. In 2023, it sold 47.2 million MT of coal, an 18% increase from 2022, and produced 49.7 million MT. Its market share in the Philippines increased to over 24% in 2023, making it a major supplier in that market. The company's sales portfolio is focused on six key countries: Philippines (31.10% of sales), Korea (9.86%), China (8.45%), India (6.84%), Bangladesh (5.58%), and Indonesia (25.03% domestic market obligation), with over 85% of total sales to these markets. The company is positioned in the lowest quartile of the seaborne thermal coal cost curve, providing a significant competitive advantage, especially during periods of price volatility. It is recognized for its large coal reserve base, high-quality coal specifications, robust infrastructure, and low CO2 emissions relative to peers. The company is described as a 'supplier of choice' and is expected to be among the last standing suppliers in the seaborne thermal coal market due to its cost leadership and infrastructure. As of 2023, it had agreements with commitments to sell over 225 million MT of coal through 2051. The company is not only a market leader in Indonesia but also a significant regional player, particularly in the Philippines and other Asian markets. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces several economic challenges and uncertainties in 2025 and beyond. Inflation remains a significant concern with certain indices rising substantially in 2024 and expected to continue into 2025, impacting all coal producers industry-wide. While Bayan Resources benefits from a low-cost position in the lowest quartile of the seaborne thermal coal market, inflationary cost pressures could still affect profitability. The coal market outlook for 2025 indicates a slight oversupply and weakening market conditions, with coal prices vulnerable to shocks in supply or demand. Key economic uncertainties include potential supply cuts in Indonesia due to rising costs or government production caps, weather-related disruptions affecting coal supply and logistics (notably from Australia and Indonesia), and geopolitical tensions (e.g., Ukraine/Russia and Israel/Gaza) that could disrupt energy markets and supply chains, potentially driving inflation higher and dampening economic activity. Additionally, global economic growth risks include financial market volatility, slower-than-expected disinflation, contraction in China's property sector, and rising protectionist policies that may hinder trade and economic growth. The Company also faces risks from fluctuations in coal and fuel prices, foreign exchange exposure primarily from Rupiah-denominated items, and interest rate risks on borrowings. Government policies in Indonesia, such as export proceeds lock-up, subsidy revocations increasing diesel fuel costs, and coal pricing regulations, may increase operational costs. Overall, these macroeconomic factors, cost pressures, market conditions, and policy changes create a challenging economic environment that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces significant economic challenges including ongoing inflation which is expected to continue into 2024, impacting industry-wide cost structures. While Bayan Resources benefits from a low-cost position in the lowest quartile of the energy-adjusted seaborne thermal coal market, inflationary pressures may render some higher-cost mines uneconomic, potentially leading to closures. The coal market remains finely balanced between supply and demand, making prices vulnerable to shocks such as changes in China's coal imports (which accounted for about 25% of the seaborne thermal coal market in 2023), weather-related disruptions affecting supply from Australia and Indonesia, and geopolitical tensions impacting oil and gas markets that could indirectly affect coal prices. Additionally, government policies in Indonesia, including increased royalties, financial penalties for Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) non-compliance, and foreign exchange proceeds restrictions, contribute to cost pressures and regulatory uncertainty. The Company also faces risks from fluctuating coal prices, foreign exchange exposure primarily from Rupiah-denominated expenses, interest rate variability on floating rate borrowings, and liquidity risks related to funding and working capital management. The global economic environment, including recession risks and shifting energy demand patterns, especially in advanced economies with declining coal demand, further add to uncertainties affecting revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The 2024 annual report does not explicitly discuss competitive pressures or market competition from established players or new entrants. There is no direct mention of competitive threats, technological disruption, or industry dynamics challenging the Company's market position. The report emphasizes the Company's strong market position due to its large coal reserve base, low cost position on the seaborne thermal coal cost curve, good mining infrastructure, solid coal sales commitments, and relatively lower CO2 equivalent emissions. It also highlights strategic alliances, quality management, and timely supply as differentiators. However, no forward-looking competitive challenges or uncertainties are specifically addressed in the provided text. | The Company operates in a competitive coal market characterized by strong competition from established producers in Indonesia, Australia, Russia, and emerging market entrants. The coal market dynamics are influenced by shifting demand towards Asia, particularly China, India, and ASEAN countries, which together represent over 70% of global coal demand. Competitive pressures arise from the need to maintain cost leadership and operational efficiency amid rising stripping ratios and inflationary cost increases. The Company faces challenges from market competition intensified by increased domestic coal production in major importers like China and India, reducing import needs and altering trade flows. Technological and operational disruptions include weather-related supply chain impacts and infrastructure constraints. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and sanctions affecting coal supply sources (e.g., Russian coal sanctions) create market volatility and competitive shifts. The Company’s strategy to maintain a strong market position includes leveraging its large coal reserves, low-cost production, superior infrastructure, and long-term supply contracts with key customers across multiple countries. However, the industry’s long-term outlook is challenged by the anticipated decline in thermal coal demand due to energy transition trends, requiring the Company to continuously improve efficiencies and adapt to evolving market and regulatory conditions. |
