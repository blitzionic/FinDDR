# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Dian Swastatika Sentosa Tbk's revenue declined significantly over the period, from 5,956.1 million USD in 2022 to 5,014.7 million USD in 2023, and further to 3,017.8 million USD in 2024. Gross profit followed this downward trend, dropping from 2,638.0 million USD in 2022 to 2,072.3 million USD in 2023 and 1,228.4 million USD in 2024. Gross margin also compressed, moving from 44.29% in 2022 to 41.32% in 2023 and 40.71% in 2024. By product, mining remained the dominant revenue source but its share decreased from 95.4% (5,684.0 million USD) in 2022 to 93.2% (4,673.4 million USD) in 2023 and 91.9% (2,773.2 million USD) in 2024, while Pay TV & internet grew from 1.1% (66.0 million USD) in 2022 to 4.8% (144.1 million USD) in 2024. Geographically, revenue from India and Japan declined sharply: India fell from 1,113.6 million USD in 2022 to 327.6 million USD in 2024, and Japan from 981.2 million USD in 2022 to zero in 2024, while Indonesia and China remained relatively stable (Indonesia: 1,222.4 million USD in 2022 to 1,241.8 million USD in 2024; China: 1,324.3 million USD in 2022 to 1,250.1 million USD in 2024). |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin decreased each year, from 29.84% in 2022 to 25.02% in 2023 and 21.56% in 2024, indicating declining operating efficiency. Operating income dropped from 1,777.1 million USD in 2022 to 1,254.8 million USD in 2023 and 650.7 million USD in 2024, while revenue also declined, showing that cost reductions did not keep pace with falling sales. Operating expenses were reduced from 860.9 million USD in 2022 to 817.5 million USD in 2023 and 577.7 million USD in 2024, but this was not enough to offset the sharper revenue contraction. The company managed to lower operating expenses by 283.2 million USD from 2022 to 2024, but gross profit fell by 1,409.6 million USD over the same period, highlighting the challenge in maintaining profitability amid declining sales. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 18.88% in 2022 to 26.73% in 2023, before declining to 23.58% in 2024. The spike in 2023 tax rate (26.73%) contributed to a sharper drop in net profit that year (865.3 million USD in 2023 vs 1,298.2 million USD in 2022), despite a smaller decrease in pre-tax income. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Dian Swastatika Sentosa Tbk demonstrated a solid financial position, with total assets increasing to USD 3,695.1 million from USD 3,063.3 million in 2023. Current assets rose to USD 1,998.3 million, outpacing the increase in current liabilities to USD 857.4 million, resulting in a significantly improved current ratio of 233.07% (up from 172.68%), indicating strong short-term liquidity. Total liabilities increased to USD 1,751.5 million, with non-current liabilities rising more sharply than current liabilities, suggesting a shift toward longer-term obligations. Shareholders' equity grew to USD 1,943.6 million, and retained earnings increased to USD 2,163.1 million, reflecting continued profit retention. The debt to equity ratio rose to 90.12% from 78.02%, indicating a higher reliance on debt financing, but the capital structure remains balanced given the equity growth. Overall, the company’s asset base and liquidity position strengthened, though leverage increased moderately. | In 2023, PT Dian Swastatika Sentosa Tbk experienced a significant contraction in its balance sheet, with total assets decreasing from 6,497.2 million USD in 2022 to 3,063.3 million USD. Total liabilities also declined sharply from 3,439.2 million USD to 1,342.5 million USD, resulting in a lower debt to equity ratio of 78.02% (down from 112.47%), indicating a less leveraged capital structure. Shareholders' equity decreased to 1,720.8 million USD, but retained earnings increased to 1,809.0 million USD, suggesting profit retention despite lower net profit. The current ratio improved to 172.68% (from 135.77%), reflecting stronger short-term liquidity. Both current and non-current assets and liabilities declined, but the reduction in liabilities outpaced that of assets, improving solvency and liquidity metrics. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 is characterized by a leaner, less leveraged balance sheet and improved liquidity, despite a smaller asset base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability declined in 2024, with revenue dropping sharply to USD 3,017.8 million from USD 5,014.7 million in 2023. Gross profit fell to USD 1,228.4 million, and operating income decreased to USD 650.7 million. Net profit also declined to USD 542.8 million. Despite these declines, the net profit margin slightly improved to 17.99% (from 17.26%), while gross margin remained stable at 40.71% (vs. 41.32%). Operating margin decreased to 21.56% (from 25.02%), reflecting higher relative operating expenses. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) both decreased to 29.63% and 16.06%, respectively, indicating lower profitability relative to the company’s capital base. The effective tax rate decreased to 23.58% (from 26.73%), supporting net profit. Overall, while margins held up relatively well, the significant revenue contraction led to lower absolute earnings and returns. | Profitability declined in 2023, with revenue falling to 5,014.7 million USD from 5,956.1 million USD in 2022. Gross profit dropped to 2,072.3 million USD, and net profit decreased to 865.3 million USD. Margins compressed across the board: gross margin fell to 41.32% (from 44.29%), operating margin to 25.02% (from 29.84%), and net profit margin to 17.26% (from 21.80%). The effective tax rate increased to 26.73% (from 18.88%), further impacting net profit. Despite these declines, return on equity (36.21%) and return on assets (18.10%) in 2023 are strong, indicating efficient use of capital and assets relative to the reduced equity and asset base. Earnings quality is affected by lower revenue and higher tax burden, but profitability ratios remain robust relative to industry norms. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency weakened in 2024. Cost of goods sold decreased in line with revenue, but asset turnover dropped to 89.31% from 104.90%, indicating less efficient use of assets to generate sales. Operating expenses were reduced to USD 577.7 million, but not enough to offset the revenue decline. Net cash from operations fell to USD 693.4 million (from USD 1,031.1 million), reflecting lower profitability and possibly changes in working capital. Inventories increased to USD 119.4 million, which, combined with lower sales, may signal slower inventory turnover. Net cash from investing remained negative at USD (594.9) million, indicating continued investment activity. Notably, net cash from financing turned positive at USD 180.1 million (from negative in 2023), suggesting new financing or reduced repayments. The net increase in cash was positive at USD 278.6 million, reversing the prior year’s cash outflow, but this was driven more by financing than operations. | Operational efficiency weakened in 2023, as evidenced by a decline in asset turnover to 104.90% (2022: N/A), and a reduction in net cash from operations to 1,031.1 million USD (from 2,092.2 million USD). Cost of goods sold decreased in line with revenue, but operating expenses were only modestly reduced, leading to lower operating income. Inventories dropped significantly to 101.8 million USD (from 282.5 million USD), suggesting tighter inventory management or lower business activity. Net cash from investing was less negative at (592.0) million USD, indicating reduced investment outflows. Net cash from financing turned negative at (909.1) million USD, reflecting possible debt repayments or dividend payouts. The net decrease in cash of (470.0) million USD contrasts with a positive cash increase in 2022, highlighting reduced cash generation and possible liquidity tightening. Working capital management appears prudent, but overall operational cash flow and efficiency have declined. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show a mixed picture. The current ratio improved to 233.07%, indicating strong liquidity and low short-term risk. However, the debt to equity ratio increased to 90.12%, reflecting higher leverage and a greater proportion of debt in the capital structure. Interest coverage remained very high at 1,068.47%, suggesting ample ability to service interest obligations. The effective tax rate decreased, which may reflect changes in tax planning or jurisdictional mix. The increase in non-current liabilities and positive net cash from financing could signal increased long-term borrowing, which may elevate future refinancing or interest rate risk. The sharp revenue decline, especially in key markets like India and Japan, and the concentration in mining (91.9% of revenue), heighten business risk if market conditions worsen further. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023. The debt to equity ratio fell to 78.02%, and the current ratio rose to 172.68%, both signaling reduced leverage and improved liquidity. Interest coverage increased to 1,167.26% (from 1,118.38%), indicating a strong ability to service interest obligations. However, the effective tax rate rose to 26.73%, which could signal higher tax exposure or less favorable tax treatment. The sharp reduction in both assets and liabilities may indicate asset sales or restructuring, which could pose operational risks if not managed carefully. The negative net cash from financing and the net decrease in cash suggest potential liquidity risks if cash outflows persist. No immediate solvency or interest coverage concerns are evident, but the company should monitor cash flow sustainability and the impact of higher taxes. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company’s increased investment outflows (USD 594.9 million) suggest ongoing capital projects or expansion, which could support future growth if well-executed. The positive net cash from financing in 2024 may indicate new debt or equity raised to fund these investments. However, the sustainability of cash flows is a concern, as operational cash generation declined significantly. The absence of dividend data for 2024 leaves dividend policy unclear. Revenue remains highly concentrated in mining (91.9%), and geographic diversification narrowed, with notable declines in India and the absence of revenue from Japan and the Netherlands. Growth in Pay TV & internet revenue (from USD 92.0 million to USD 144.1 million) suggests some diversification, but the overall revenue base contracted. Future performance will depend on the success of investment activities, stabilization or recovery in core markets, and the ability to maintain liquidity and manage higher leverage. | Looking ahead, the company’s reduced investment outflows (net cash from investing of (592.0) million USD) and negative net cash from financing (including a much lower dividend payout of 23.3 million USD compared to 420 million USD in 2022) suggest a more conservative capital allocation and possible deleveraging. The sustainability of cash flows is a concern, given the net decrease in cash and lower operational cash generation. Revenue remains highly concentrated in mining (93.2%), with only modest growth in trading and pay TV/internet segments, indicating limited diversification. Geographically, revenue from Indonesia increased, while other regions such as India, Japan, and Korea saw declines, potentially exposing the company to regional demand risks. Future performance will depend on the company’s ability to stabilize revenue, manage costs, and maintain liquidity, especially if mining sector volatility persists. The company’s strong ROE and ROA provide a solid base, but further diversification and cash flow improvement are needed for sustained growth. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The company's primary business model is diversified across several key segments: coal mining and trading, technology (including cable TV, internet, and digital services), fertilizer and chemicals trading, steam and electricity supply, renewable energy, and rental services. Revenue is generated mainly through the sale of coal (domestic and export), provision of internet and pay-TV subscriptions, trading of fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides, as well as fees for steam and electricity processing. The company also earns revenue from renewable energy projects (solar and geothermal, though currently at an early stage), and rental income. Revenue recognition is based on the delivery of goods (for coal, fertilizers, chemicals) or the rendering of services (for electricity, steam, internet, and telecommunication services). In 2024, coal mining and trading contributed the largest share of revenue (USD 2.77 billion), followed by technology (USD 144.1 million), trading (USD 90.0 million), and steam/electricity processing fees (USD 9.7 million). The company also imports a portion of fertilizers and pesticides to meet domestic demand and is expanding its market reach both domestically and internationally. The business model emphasizes operational efficiency, supply chain optimization, and product/service innovation to maintain competitiveness. | PT Dian Swastatika Sentosa Tbk operates a diversified business model primarily focused on coal mining and trading, which contributed 93.2% of total revenues in 2023 (USD 4,673.4 million out of USD 5,014.7 million). The company generates revenue mainly through the sale of thermal coal, both domestically and internationally, with sales recognized at the point of delivery or shipment. Other business segments include power and steam generation (0.8% of revenue), technology (pay-TV and internet services, 1.8% of revenue), and fertilizer & chemical trading (4.2% of revenue). The power and steam generation business operates captive power plants and recognizes revenue as services are delivered. The technology segment, managed through subsidiaries, provides multimedia, internet, and pay-TV services, with revenue recognized as services are rendered. Fertilizer and chemical trading is conducted mainly through imports to meet domestic demand, with a significant portion of sales to related parties (Sinarmas group subsidiaries). The company also invests in new business lines such as renewable energy (solar and geothermal), digital platforms, and data centers, though these have not yet contributed significant revenue as of 2023. |
| Market Position | In 2024, the company held a 6.4% market share of Indonesia's total coal production, down from 7.3% in 2023, indicating a strong but slightly declining position in the coal mining sector. This positions the company as a significant player, though not the market leader, in the Indonesian coal industry. In the chemicals segment, the company imported approximately 4.6% of Indonesia's total fertilizer imports and 6.3% of pesticide imports, with most sales still dominated by affiliated entities but with growing presence in the free market and initial steps into international markets. The technology business (internet and pay-TV) contributed 4.8% of total revenue in 2024, with 914,001 multimedia subscribers, and is recognized for network expansion and service quality, as evidenced by industry awards. The company faces intense competition in technology and chemicals, with risks of price wars and margin pressure, but responds with product differentiation, operational efficiency, and market expansion. In renewable energy, the company is in the early stages of market entry, with no significant market share yet. Overall, the company is a major, diversified challenger in its key markets—particularly coal and chemicals—leveraging operational scale, supply chain integration, and innovation, but does not hold clear market leadership in any single segment. | PT Dian Swastatika Sentosa Tbk is a market leader in Indonesia's coal mining and trading sector, with a domestic coal market share of 7.3% in 2023 (up from 5.6% in 2022) out of Indonesia's total coal production of 775 million tons. The company is also a major exporter, with 68.7% of coal sales allocated to export markets such as China, India, South Korea, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan, and Taiwan. Indonesia remains the largest coal exporter globally, with 34.1% of total global export supply. The company is recognized as one of Indonesia's largest companies, ranking 15th in the Fortune Indonesia 100 (2023) and 11th in Swa Magazine's 100 Indonesia's Best Wealth Creators. In the technology segment (pay-TV and internet), the company is expanding rapidly, with 3.36 million home-passes and 525,595 subscribers as of 2023, but faces intense competition and is not identified as a market leader. In fertilizer and chemical trading, the company imported around 3.0% of Indonesia's total fertilizer imports and 6.3% of pesticide imports in 2023, with sales still dominated by related parties but expanding into new markets.
