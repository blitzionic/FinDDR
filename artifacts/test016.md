# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Harum Energy Tbk's revenue increased significantly from USD 904,437,795 in 2022 to USD 925,520,340 in 2023, and further to USD 1,295,465,928 in 2024. Despite this top-line growth, gross profit declined from USD 541,495,152 in 2022 to USD 382,401,701 in 2023 and USD 283,411,011 in 2024, reflecting a sharp drop in gross margin from 59.87% in 2022 to 41.32% in 2023 and 21.88% in 2024. By product, Mining revenue fell from USD 890.4 million in 2022 to USD 814.7 million in 2023 and USD 542.9 million in 2024, while Nickel Refining surged from USD 100.1 million in 2023 to USD 738.1 million in 2024. Geographically, export revenue dominated, rising from USD 780.6 million in 2023 to USD 1,097.3 million in 2024, with domestic revenue also increasing from USD 144.9 million to USD 198.1 million. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined sharply from 48.67% in 2022 to 30.99% in 2023 and 16.63% in 2024, indicating deteriorating operating efficiency. Operating income dropped from USD 440,202,830 in 2022 to USD 286,858,096 in 2023 and USD 215,413,836 in 2024, even as revenue grew, highlighting that cost increases outpaced revenue gains. Operating expenses were reduced from USD 101,306,186 in 2022 to USD 95,443,605 in 2023 and further to USD 67,997,175 in 2024, but this cost control was insufficient to offset the much larger rise in cost of goods sold, which jumped from USD 362,942,643 in 2022 to USD 543,118,639 in 2023 and USD 1,012,054,917 in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 20.47% in 2022 to 25.60% in 2023 and sharply to 32.53% in 2024, which contributed to the decline in net profit from USD 379,772,107 in 2022 to USD 195,672,112 in 2023 and USD 77,659,731 in 2024. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors are listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Harum Energy Tbk demonstrated a significant expansion in its balance sheet, with total assets rising to USD 2,574,539,092 from USD 1,633,107,192 in 2023. This growth was driven by increases in both current assets (USD 580,110,377) and non-current assets (USD 1,994,428,715). Total liabilities also increased to USD 791,884,570 (from USD 458,386,742), with non-current liabilities more than doubling, indicating increased long-term obligations. Shareholders' equity strengthened to USD 1,782,654,522, reflecting retained earnings growth and/or capital injections. The current ratio improved to 186.84% (from 168.31%), indicating strong short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio rose to 44.42% (from 39.02%), suggesting a moderate increase in leverage but still within a conservative range. Overall, the company’s capital structure remains robust, with equity financing dominating and liquidity metrics indicating a healthy ability to meet short-term obligations. | In 2023, PT Harum Energy Tbk demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing to USD 1,633.1 million from USD 1,278.8 million in 2022, indicating significant asset growth. Shareholders' equity also rose to USD 1,174.7 million, up from USD 992.3 million, reflecting retained earnings growth and a strong capital base. Total liabilities increased to USD 458.4 million (from USD 286.5 million), with both current and non-current liabilities rising, suggesting increased leverage. The current ratio declined to 168.31% from 230.06%, indicating reduced but still healthy short-term liquidity. Debt to equity increased to 39.02% from 28.88%, showing a higher reliance on debt but remaining at a manageable level. Overall, the company maintains a robust balance sheet, though the trend toward higher leverage and lower liquidity warrants monitoring. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 declined despite a substantial increase in revenue to USD 1,295,465,928 (up from USD 925,520,340 in 2023). Gross profit fell to USD 283,411,011, and net profit dropped sharply to USD 77,659,731 (from USD 195,672,112). Margins contracted significantly: gross margin to 21.88% (from 41.32%), operating margin to 16.63% (from 30.99%), and net profit margin to 5.99% (from 21.14%). Return on equity decreased to 5.25% (from 18.06%), and return on assets to 3.69% (from 13.44%), indicating lower earnings quality and efficiency. The effective tax rate increased to 32.53% (from 25.60%), further pressuring net results. The sharp margin compression, despite higher sales, points to increased cost of goods sold and possibly lower pricing power or higher input costs, especially as nickel refining became a much larger revenue contributor. | Profitability in 2023 declined compared to 2022. Revenue grew modestly to USD 925.5 million (from USD 904.4 million), but cost of goods sold rose sharply, compressing gross profit to USD 382.4 million (from USD 541.5 million). Gross margin fell to 41.32% (from 59.87%), and operating margin dropped to 30.99% (from 48.67%), reflecting increased cost pressures. Net profit decreased significantly to USD 195.7 million (from USD 379.8 million), with net profit margin halving to 21.14% (from 41.99%). Return on equity (18.06%) and return on assets (13.44%) for 2023 indicate reasonable profitability relative to the asset and equity base, but the overall earnings quality has weakened due to margin compression and lower net income. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency weakened in 2024. Cost of goods sold rose disproportionately to USD 1,012,054,917 (from USD 543,118,639), outpacing revenue growth and eroding gross profit. Asset turnover slightly decreased to 61.58% (from 63.57%), indicating marginally less efficient use of assets to generate sales. Operating expenses were reduced to USD 67,997,175 (from USD 95,443,605), showing some cost control at the operating level. Net cash from operations remained stable at USD 207,101,331 (vs. USD 210,435,817), but net cash from investing swung sharply negative to USD (278,908,009), reflecting significant capital expenditures or investments. Net cash from financing turned positive at USD 33,037,529 (from negative USD 432,962,043), possibly due to new debt or equity issuance. The net decrease in cash was smaller at USD (38,769,149) compared to the prior year. Dividend payments were reduced to USD (43,811,975), indicating a more conservative payout in light of lower profits. | Operational efficiency deteriorated in 2023. Asset turnover was 63.57%, but net cash from operations dropped to USD 210.4 million (from USD 398.5 million), indicating reduced cash generation from core activities. Operating expenses were well controlled, decreasing to USD 95.4 million (from USD 101.3 million), but this was offset by a substantial increase in cost of goods sold. Working capital management appears tighter, with current assets falling to USD 432.3 million (from USD 519.3 million) and inventories rising to USD 77.8 million (from USD 43.2 million). Net cash from investing turned positive at USD 9.1 million (from outflows of USD 103.1 million), suggesting reduced or more efficient investment activity. However, net cash from financing was a large outflow at USD 433.0 million, and the company paid higher dividends (USD 80.0 million vs. USD 26.9 million). The net decrease in cash of USD 213.4 million signals a significant cash outflow for the year. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a moderate increase in leverage and a notable rise in interest expense to USD (32,539,865) (from USD (6,062,236)), which reduced interest coverage to 662.00% (from 4,731.89%). While still strong, this is a significant deterioration and warrants monitoring. The current ratio improved, mitigating short-term liquidity risk. The debt to equity ratio increased but remains at a manageable 44.42%. The effective tax rate rose to 32.53%, which, combined with higher interest expense, compressed net profits. The company’s large increase in non-current liabilities and negative investing cash flow suggest increased exposure to long-term financial commitments and project execution risk. No inventory data is available for 2024, which may obscure some working capital risk assessment. Overall, while liquidity is strong, rising leverage, interest costs, and tax rates are early warning signs. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show some areas of concern. The current ratio, while still above 1, declined to 168.31%, indicating reduced liquidity. Debt to equity increased to 39.02%, reflecting higher leverage. Interest coverage, though still very high at 4,731.89%, decreased from 13,710.32%, suggesting lower buffer for interest payments due to higher interest expense and lower operating income. The effective tax rate increased to 25.60% (from 20.47%), which could impact future net profits. The significant net cash outflow and higher dividend payments, combined with increased liabilities, may signal rising financial risk if these trends persist. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company’s significant investment outflows in 2024 (net cash from investing: USD (278,908,009)) suggest a strategic focus on growth, particularly in nickel refining, which saw revenue surge to USD 738.1 million (from USD 100.1 million). Mining revenue declined, indicating a shift in business mix. Export sales now dominate at 84.7% of total revenue, increasing exposure to global market dynamics. The sustainability of cash flows is challenged by lower profitability and higher financial costs, but operational cash generation remains stable. Dividend payments were reduced, likely to preserve cash for investment. If nickel refining margins can be improved and new investments yield returns, future performance could recover. However, the company must manage execution and market risks associated with its expanded asset base and increased leverage. Geographic and segment diversification may support long-term growth, but near-term earnings quality and margin recovery are key to sustaining financial health. | Looking ahead, PT Harum Energy Tbk's investment activity in 2023 was subdued, with a small net cash inflow from investing, possibly indicating a pause or completion of major capital projects. The sustainability of cash flows is a concern, given the sharp drop in operating cash flow and large cash outflows from financing and dividends. The company diversified its revenue base, with nickel refining contributing USD 100.1 million in 2023 (previously N/A), and rental/services revenue more than doubling. Export revenue remains dominant, but domestic sales increased to USD 144.9 million. If cost pressures persist and cash outflows continue, future financial performance may be challenged unless operational efficiency improves or new investments yield returns. Dividend policy appears more aggressive, which could constrain liquidity if not matched by stronger cash generation. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The company's primary business model is based on the extraction, processing, and sale of coal and nickel, supported by integrated logistics and rental services. Revenue is generated mainly through the sale of coal and nickel products (including coal, nickel matte, and ferronickel) to both export and domestic markets, with a significant focus on long-term contracts with power generation companies in Asia (especially China) and stainless steel producers in China. In 2024, the company recorded total revenues of USD1,295.5 million, with 57.0% of revenue contributed by the nickel segment (USD738.1 million) and 42.0% from coal (USD542.9 million). The company also earns income from rental and logistics services (USD32.5 million in 2024), such as coal shipping, tugboat rental, and coal handling/hauling road services. The business model is further supported by diversification into higher-value nickel products and downstream activities, including the development of a High-Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) smelter for battery materials. The company leverages its subsidiaries and associated entities for mining, processing, refining, and logistics operations, aiming for operational efficiency and value-added product development. | The company's primary business model is based on the extraction, processing, and sale of coal and nickel, complemented by rental and service activities. Revenue is mainly generated from the export and local sales of coal and ferronickel, as well as from rental income related to heavy equipment, hauling roads, and shipping services. In 2023, the company operated through four main segments: (1) coal and nickel mining (including survey, exploration, exploitation, and sales), (2) rental and services (coal shipping, tugboat rental, coal handling, and hauling road services), (3) nickel refining (ferronickel production and sales), and (4) other business activities such as investments. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of coal or ferronickel is transferred to customers. In 2023, external revenues were USD814.7 million from mining, USD10.7 million from rental and services, and USD100.1 million from nickel refining, totaling USD925.5 million. The company targets both export (84.3% of revenue) and domestic (15.7%) markets, with coal sales primarily to power generation companies in Asia and ferronickel sales to stainless steel producers in China. The business model is further supported by long-term customer relationships and diversification into integrated nickel operations for sustainable growth. |
| Market Position | The company is a significant player in Indonesia's coal and nickel sectors, with a growing emphasis on nickel. In 2024, the nickel business became the largest revenue contributor, reflecting the success of the company's diversification strategy. The company targets key export markets in Asia, particularly China, for both coal (mainly to power generation companies) and nickel (mainly to stainless steel producers). While specific market share percentages for the company are not provided, Indonesia as a country controlled 63% of global nickel production in 2024, and the company is positioned as a major participant in this dominant national industry. The company faces competition from other major coal and nickel exporters such as Australia and South Africa, competing on quality, price, transportation cost, and supply reliability. The company maintains competitiveness through long-term customer relationships, operational efficiency, and a diversified product portfolio. In coal, the company is not described as the market leader but is a notable exporter with nearly 6 million tons of coal sales in 2024. In nickel, the company is rapidly expanding, with nickel sales volume increasing by 110.7% to 57,583 Ni tons in 2024, and is investing in downstream projects to further strengthen its position. The company can be characterized as a strong challenger and emerging leader in the Indonesian nickel industry, with a solid presence in coal and integrated logistics. | The company is a significant player in Indonesia's coal and nickel mining sectors, with a strong export orientation. In 2023, it recorded total revenues of USD925.5 million, with coal sales contributing USD814.7 million and ferronickel sales USD100.1 million. The company primarily targets leading power generation companies in Asia (especially China) for coal and stainless steel producers in China for nickel. Export markets accounted for 84.3% of total revenue, with the remainder from domestic sales. While specific market share percentages are not provided, the company benefits from established long-term relationships with major customers and has demonstrated adaptability by diversifying into nickel refining. The company is not explicitly described as a market leader, challenger, or niche player, nor are precise market share figures given. However, its ability to increase coal sales volume by 41.2% in 2023 (to 7.1 million tons) despite a 35.2% drop in average coal selling price, and its successful entry into the nickel refining segment, indicate a competitive and resilient position in the market. The company leverages product diversification, operational efficiency, and business integration as key competitive advantages. No explicit market share percentage or ranking is disclosed in the provided context. |
