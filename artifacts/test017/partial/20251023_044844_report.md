# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue increased modestly from IDR 147,306 million in 2022 to IDR 149,216 million in 2023 and further to IDR 149,967 million in 2024, indicating a slowing growth rate. Gross margin declined from 31.05% in 2022 to 30.10% in 2023 and further to 28.26% in 2024, reflecting rising cost pressures as Cost of Goods Sold rose from IDR 101,569 million in 2022 to IDR 107,581 million in 2024. By product/service, Mobile revenue decreased from IDR 85,493 million in 2022 to IDR 83,400 million in 2024, while Enterprise and WIB segments grew from IDR 19,181 million and IDR 15,442 million in 2022 to IDR 20,593 million and IDR 18,002 million in 2024, respectively. Geographically, Indonesia remains the dominant market with revenue rising from IDR 139,983 million in 2022 to IDR 141,062 million in 2024, while international revenue increased from IDR 7,323 million to IDR 8,905 million over the same period. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 26.87% in 2022 to 29.74% in 2023, but slightly declined to 28.67% in 2024. Operating income followed a similar trend, rising from IDR 39,581 million in 2022 to IDR 44,384 million in 2023, then decreasing to IDR 42,991 million in 2024, despite revenue growth. Notably, operating expenses are reported as zero for all years, suggesting either full absorption in COGS or a reporting anomaly. Cost management appears challenged as gross margin eroded by 2.79 percentage points from 2022 to 2024, while revenue growth was minimal (IDR 2,661 million increase over two years), indicating that cost increases outpaced revenue gains. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 23.83% in 2022 to 21.05% in 2023, then slightly increased to 21.48% in 2024, contributing to improved net profit margin from 18.79% in 2022 to 21.58% in 2023, before declining to 20.50% in 2024. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided financial data. |

Gross profit increased to IDR 44,384 million, and operating income matched this figure, as operating expenses were reported as zero. The net profit margin improved to 21.58% (from 18.79%), and operating margin rose to 29.74% (from 26.87%), indicating better cost management and earnings quality. Gross margin slightly declined to 30.10% (from 31.05%), suggesting a marginal increase in cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Return on equity (21.06%) and return on assets (11.46%) were strong, reflecting efficient use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate decreased to 21.05% (from 23.83%), supporting net profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 showed some pressure. Asset turnover decreased to 51.12% (2023: 53.08%), indicating slightly less effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations improved to IDR 61,600 million (2023: IDR 60,581 million), suggesting strong underlying cash generation. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities. Inventory levels remained low and stable. Net cash used in investing activities decreased to IDR (29,456) million, indicating reduced capital expenditure or investment outflows. Net cash from financing was slightly more negative at IDR (27,505) million, and dividend payments increased to IDR 17,683 million. The company achieved a positive net increase in cash of IDR 4,639 million, reversing the prior year’s cash decrease, reflecting improved cash flow management. | Operational efficiency was mixed in 2023. Asset turnover was 53.08%, indicating moderate asset utilization. Net cash from operations decreased to IDR 60,581 million (from IDR 73,354 million), suggesting reduced cash generation from core activities despite higher profits. Inventories declined to IDR 997 million, indicating improved inventory management. Net cash used in investing was IDR (36,909) million, slightly less than the prior year, while net cash used in financing decreased significantly to IDR (26,567) million. The net decrease in cash was smaller at IDR (2,895) million, reflecting improved cash retention. Working capital remained stable, as current assets and liabilities changed only slightly. Dividend payments increased to IDR 16,603 million, indicating a higher payout to shareholders. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 remain within acceptable bounds but show some areas to monitor. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly to 84.43%, and total liabilities rose, indicating marginally higher leverage. The current ratio improved to 82.17%, enhancing short-term liquidity. Interest coverage declined to 825.48% (2023: 954.08%) due to higher interest expense and lower operating income, but remains very strong, indicating ample ability to service debt. The effective tax rate was stable. No significant tax rate changes or extraordinary items are evident. Overall, while leverage and interest expense have increased, liquidity and coverage ratios remain strong, with no immediate financial distress signals. | Financial risk indicators remained stable in 2023. The current ratio was 77.71%, indicating adequate but not excessive liquidity. Debt to equity improved slightly to 83.34%, reflecting prudent leverage. Interest coverage was high at 954.08%, only slightly lower than 2022, indicating strong ability to service interest obligations. The effective tax rate decreased to 21.05%, reducing tax-related risk. No significant changes in capital structure or liquidity ratios were observed. The company’s leverage and liquidity positions do not signal immediate financial distress, but the decline in operating cash flow warrants monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company’s investment activity moderated, as seen in reduced cash outflows from investing. Sustained strong operating cash flow and a positive net cash position support ongoing dividend payments, which increased in 2024. Revenue by product/service shows a slight decline in Mobile and Consumer segments, but growth in Enterprise and WIB, suggesting a gradual shift in revenue mix. International revenue increased to IDR 8,905 million, indicating potential for further geographic diversification. The company’s ability to generate cash, maintain dividends, and invest prudently positions it for stable future performance, though margin pressures and shifting segment dynamics warrant close monitoring. | Looking ahead, the company’s increased investment outflows (IDR 36,909 million) and higher dividend payments (IDR 16,603 million) suggest a focus on both growth and shareholder returns. The sustainability of cash flows should be monitored, as net cash from operations declined in 2023. Revenue growth was driven by the WIB and Enterprise segments, with WIB revenue rising to IDR 16,928 million and Enterprise to IDR 19,508 million. Geographic revenue remained concentrated in Indonesia, but international revenue increased to IDR 8,059 million. If operational cash flow stabilizes, the company is well-positioned for continued investment and dividend distribution. However, maintaining or improving operational cash generation will be critical for future financial flexibility. |
