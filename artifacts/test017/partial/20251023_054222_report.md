# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased modestly from IDR 147,306 billion in 2022 to IDR 149,216 billion in 2023 and IDR 149,967 billion in 2024, indicating a slow growth trajectory. Gross margin declined from 32.59% in 2022 to 31.93% in 2023 and further to 28.65% in 2024, reflecting rising direct costs or pricing pressure. By product/service, Mobile revenue decreased from IDR 88,837 billion in 2022 to IDR 85,291 billion in 2023 and IDR 83,400 billion in 2024, while Enterprise revenue dropped sharply from IDR 43,807 billion in 2022 to IDR 19,508 billion in 2023 and IDR 20,593 billion in 2024. WIB revenue also declined from IDR 35,100 billion in 2022 to IDR 16,928 billion in 2023 and IDR 18,002 billion in 2024. By region, Indonesia contributed the majority of revenue, rising slightly from IDR 139,983 billion in 2022 to IDR 141,157 billion in 2023 and IDR 141,062 billion in 2024, while international revenue grew from IDR 7,323 billion in 2022 to IDR 8,059 billion in 2023 and IDR 8,905 billion in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 26.87% in 2022 to 29.74% in 2023, but slightly declined to 28.67% in 2024. Operating income increased from IDR 39,581 billion in 2022 to IDR 44,384 billion in 2023, then decreased to IDR 42,991 billion in 2024, while revenue remained relatively flat, indicating some pressure on operating efficiency. Operating expenses were IDR 66,864 billion in 2022, increased to IDR 71,385 billion in 2023, but are reported as zero in 2024, which may indicate a reporting anomaly or reclassification. Cost management appears challenged, as gross margin fell from 32.59% in 2022 to 28.65% in 2024, and the cost of goods sold increased from IDR 99,303 billion in 2022 to IDR 101,569 billion in 2023, with a possible reporting error in 2024 (IDR 107 billion). |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 23.83% in 2022 to 21.05% in 2023, then slightly increased to 21.48% in 2024, supporting net profit margin improvement from 18.79% in 2022 to 21.58% in 2023, before declining to 20.50% in 2024. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing to IDR 299,675 billion from IDR 287,042 billion in 2023. Total liabilities also rose to IDR 137,185 billion (from IDR 130,480 billion), but shareholders' equity strengthened to IDR 162,490 billion (up from IDR 156,562 billion). The current ratio improved to 82.17% from 77.71%, indicating a better, though still suboptimal, liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio edged up slightly to 84.43% (from 83.34%), reflecting a stable capital structure with moderate leverage. Retained earnings increased to IDR 109,596 billion, supporting internal capital generation. Overall, the company’s balance sheet shows growth in both assets and equity, with manageable increases in liabilities and a modest improvement in liquidity. | In 2023, PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk. demonstrated a solid financial position. Total assets increased to IDR 287,042 billion from IDR 275,192 billion in 2022, indicating asset growth. Total liabilities also rose to IDR 130,480 billion (from IDR 125,930 billion), but shareholders' equity increased to IDR 156,562 billion (from IDR 149,262 billion), reflecting retained earnings growth and a strengthening equity base. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 83.34% (from 84.37%), suggesting a marginally lower reliance on debt relative to equity. The current ratio was 77.71%, nearly unchanged from 78.22% in 2022, indicating stable but below-ideal short-term liquidity. Retained earnings grew to IDR 103,104 billion, supporting internal capital generation. Overall, the company maintained a balanced capital structure with moderate leverage and stable liquidity, though the current ratio signals room for improvement in short-term asset coverage. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 softened compared to 2023. Revenue was nearly flat at IDR 149,967 billion (up slightly from IDR 149,216 billion). Gross profit declined to IDR 42,991 billion (from IDR 44,384 billion), and net profit decreased to IDR 30,743 billion (from IDR 32,208 billion). Margins contracted: gross margin fell to 28.65% (from 31.93%), operating margin to 28.67% (from 29.74%), and net profit margin to 20.50% (from 21.58%). Return on equity dropped to 19.27% (from 21.06%), and return on assets to 10.48% (from 11.46%), indicating reduced earnings efficiency. The effective tax rate was stable at 21.48%. Overall, while the company remains profitable, earnings quality and margin strength have weakened year-over-year. | Profitability improved in 2023. Revenue increased slightly to IDR 149,216 billion (from IDR 147,306 billion), while net profit rose more significantly to IDR 32,208 billion (from IDR 27,680 billion). Gross profit increased to IDR 44,384 billion, and operating income matched this figure, both up from 2022. The net profit margin improved to 21.58% (from 18.79%), and operating margin rose to 29.74% (from 26.87%), indicating better cost management and operational leverage. Gross margin was stable at 31.93% (slightly down from 32.59%), suggesting cost of goods sold increased in line with revenue. Return on equity (ROE) was strong at 21.06%, and return on assets (ROA) was 11.46%, both indicating effective use of capital and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate decreased to 21.05% (from 23.83%), supporting net profitability. Overall, earnings quality was high, with improved margins and returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 showed mixed results. Asset turnover declined to 51.12% (from 53.08%), suggesting slightly less effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased to IDR 61,600 billion (from IDR 60,581 billion), indicating robust cash generation. Net cash used in investing activities decreased to IDR (29,456) billion (from IDR (36,909) billion), reflecting lower capital outflows. Net cash from financing was slightly more negative at IDR (27,505) billion (from IDR (26,567) billion). The company achieved a positive net increase in cash of IDR 4,639 billion (versus a decrease of IDR 2,895 billion in 2023), highlighting improved cash flow management. Inventory levels remained low and stable. Despite margin compression, the company maintained strong operational cash flows and working capital discipline. | Operational efficiency showed mixed results. Asset turnover was 53.08% in 2023, indicating moderate efficiency in using assets to generate revenue. Cost of goods sold increased to IDR 101,569 billion, but gross profit and operating income both improved, reflecting some cost control. Operating expenses rose to IDR 71,385 billion (from IDR 66,864 billion), but the increase in operating income suggests revenue growth outpaced expense growth. Net cash from operations declined to IDR 60,581 billion (from IDR 73,354 billion), indicating reduced cash generation from core activities. Net cash used in investing was lower at (IDR 36,909 billion), and net cash used in financing decreased to (IDR 26,567 billion), reflecting less outflow for both activities. The net decrease in cash was smaller at (IDR 2,895 billion), suggesting improved cash retention. Working capital remained stable, with current assets and liabilities both increasing slightly. Overall, while profitability and margins improved, the decline in operating cash flow warrants attention. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 are stable but warrant monitoring. The debt to equity ratio was nearly unchanged at 84.43%, indicating consistent leverage. The current ratio improved to 82.17%, but remains below 1, suggesting potential short-term liquidity risk. Interest coverage declined to 825.48% (from 954.08%), but remains very strong, indicating ample ability to service interest obligations. The effective tax rate was stable at 21.48%. There is a slight increase in both current and non-current liabilities, but these are matched by asset growth. No significant new risks are evident, but the ongoing margin compression and modest liquidity position should be watched. | Financial risk remained moderate in 2023. The debt to equity ratio improved slightly to 83.34%, indicating stable leverage. Interest coverage was high at 954.08%, only slightly lower than 981.43% in 2022, showing strong ability to service interest obligations. The current ratio was 77.71%, below 1, which may indicate potential short-term liquidity risk if current liabilities need to be settled quickly. The effective tax rate decreased to 21.05%, reducing tax burden and supporting net income. Interest expense increased to IDR 4,652 billion (from IDR 4,033 billion), but this was well covered by operating income. No significant changes in tax policy or other financial risks are evident from the data. The main early warning is the low current ratio, which could impact liquidity if not addressed. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company’s investment outflows decreased in 2024, which may signal a more cautious capital expenditure approach or completion of major projects. Dividend payments increased to IDR 17,683 billion (from IDR 16,603 billion), reflecting confidence in cash flow sustainability. Net cash from operations remains strong, supporting ongoing dividend policy. Revenue by product/service shows a slight decline in Mobile and Consumer segments, but growth in Enterprise and WIB, suggesting a gradual shift in revenue mix. International revenue increased to IDR 8,905 billion (from IDR 8,059 billion), indicating growing overseas presence. While margin pressures and flat topline growth may constrain future earnings, the company’s strong cash flow, stable capital structure, and evolving segment/geographic mix provide a foundation for continued, if moderate, financial stability. | Future performance prospects are cautiously optimistic. Investment outflows decreased to (IDR 36,909 billion), suggesting ongoing but slightly reduced capital investment, which may support future growth. Dividend payments remained stable at IDR 16,603 billion, indicating a consistent dividend policy. Net cash from operations declined, which could constrain future investment or dividend capacity if the trend continues. Revenue by product/service shows a decline in Mobile and Enterprise segments, with a significant drop in WIB and Lain-lain, but Consumer revenue was stable. Geographic revenue shows growth in both Indonesia and international markets, with international revenue increasing to IDR 8,059 billion. Sustained asset and equity growth, along with strong profitability, support future performance, but the company should monitor cash flow trends and segment performance to ensure continued financial health. |
