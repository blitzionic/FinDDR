# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, total revenue increased modestly from IDR 147,306 billion in 2022 to IDR 149,216 billion in 2023 and IDR 149,967 billion in 2024, indicating a cumulative growth of 1.8% over the period. Gross margin declined from 31.05% in 2022 to 31.93% in 2023, then dropped to 28.65% in 2024, reflecting rising direct costs or pricing pressure in the latest year. By product/service, Mobile revenue decreased from IDR 85,493 billion in 2022 to IDR 83,400 billion in 2024, while Enterprise and WIB segments grew from IDR 19,181 billion and IDR 15,442 billion in 2022 to IDR 20,593 billion and IDR 18,002 billion in 2024, respectively. Geographically, Indonesia remains the dominant market, with revenue rising from IDR 139,983 billion in 2022 to IDR 141,062 billion in 2024, while international revenue increased from IDR 7,323 billion to IDR 8,905 billion over the same period. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 26.87% in 2022 to 29.74% in 2023, but slightly declined to 28.67% in 2024. Operating income followed a similar trend, rising from IDR 39,581 billion in 2022 to IDR 44,384 billion in 2023, then decreasing to IDR 42,991 billion in 2024, while revenue remained relatively flat. Operating expenses were IDR 69,863 billion in 2022, increased to IDR 71,385 billion in 2023, but are reported as zero in 2024, which may indicate a reporting anomaly or reclassification. Cost management appears mixed: while gross profit increased from IDR 39,581 billion in 2022 to IDR 44,384 billion in 2023, it fell to IDR 42,991 billion in 2024, and the gross margin contraction in 2024 suggests higher direct costs or less effective cost control. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 23.83% in 2022 to 21.05% in 2023, then slightly increased to 21.48% in 2024, contributing to improved net profit margins from 18.79% in 2022 to 21.58% in 2023, before declining to 20.50% in 2024. No non-recurring items are explicitly listed in the provided financial data. No external factors affecting profitability are explicitly mentioned in the data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets rising to IDR 299,675 billion from IDR 287,042 billion in 2023. Total liabilities increased to IDR 137,185 billion (from IDR 130,480 billion), while shareholders' equity grew to IDR 162,490 billion (from IDR 156,562 billion), indicating a stable capital structure. The current ratio improved to 82.17% from 77.71%, reflecting slightly better short-term liquidity, though it remains below 1, suggesting some liquidity constraints. Debt to equity edged up to 84.43% from 83.34%, indicating a marginally higher reliance on debt but still within a manageable range. Retained earnings increased to IDR 109,596 billion, supporting internal capital generation. Overall, the companyâ€™s financial health in 2024 is stable, with incremental improvements in liquidity and equity, though the current ratio signals the need for continued attention to short-term obligations. | In 2023, PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk. demonstrated a solid financial position. Total assets increased to IDR 287,042 billion from IDR 275,192 billion in 2022, reflecting ongoing asset growth. Total liabilities also rose to IDR 130,480 billion (from IDR 125,930 billion), but shareholders' equity improved to IDR 156,562 billion (up from IDR 149,262 billion), indicating strengthened capital structure. The debt to equity ratio slightly decreased to 83.34% (from 84.37%), suggesting a marginally lower reliance on debt financing. The current ratio remained stable at 77.71% (2022: 78.22%), indicating consistent short-term liquidity, though it is below 1, which may signal tight liquidity. Retained earnings grew to IDR 103,104 billion, supporting internal capital generation. Overall, the company maintained a healthy balance sheet with moderate leverage and stable liquidity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 softened compared to 2023. Revenue was nearly flat at IDR 149,967 billion (up slightly from IDR 149,216 billion), but gross profit declined to IDR 42,991 billion (from IDR 44,384 billion), and net profit decreased to IDR 30,743 billion (from IDR 32,208 billion). Margins contracted: gross margin fell to 28.65% (from 31.93%), operating margin to 28.67% (from 29.74%), and net profit margin to 20.50% (from 21.58%). Return on equity dropped to 19.27% (from 21.06%), and return on assets to 10.48% (from 11.46%), indicating reduced earnings efficiency. The effective tax rate was stable at 21.48%. Overall, while the company remains profitable, earnings quality and margin strength have weakened, reflecting higher costs and competitive or operational pressures. | Profitability improved across all key metrics in 2023. Revenue grew modestly to IDR 149,216 billion (2022: IDR 147,306 billion). Gross profit increased to IDR 44,384 billion (from IDR 39,581 billion), with gross margin rising to 31.93% (2022: 31.05%). Operating income and margin also improved, with operating margin at 29.74% (2022: 26.87%). Net profit rose significantly to IDR 32,208 billion (from IDR 27,680 billion), and net profit margin increased to 21.58% (2022: 18.79%). Return on equity (ROE) was strong at 21.06%, and return on assets (ROA) was 11.46%, both indicating efficient use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate decreased to 21.05% (from 23.83%), supporting net profitability. These results reflect robust earnings quality and improved profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 showed mixed results. Asset turnover declined to 51.12% (from 53.08%), indicating slightly less effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased to IDR 61,600 billion (from IDR 60,581 billion), suggesting robust cash generation despite margin compression. Net cash used in investing decreased to IDR (29,456) billion (from IDR (36,909) billion), implying reduced capital expenditures or investment outflows. Net cash from financing was slightly more negative at IDR (27,505) billion, and dividends paid increased to IDR 17,683 billion. The company achieved a positive net increase in cash of IDR 4,639 billion (versus a decrease in 2023), reflecting improved cash management. Inventory levels remained low and stable. Overall, the company maintained strong operational cash flow and working capital discipline, though asset utilization efficiency declined. | Operational efficiency showed mixed trends in 2023. While revenue and gross profit increased, cost of goods sold remained flat at IDR 101,569 billion. Operating expenses rose slightly to IDR 71,385 billion (from IDR 69,863 billion), but the company managed to improve both gross and operating margins. Asset turnover was 53.08%, indicating moderate asset utilization. Net cash from operations declined to IDR 60,581 billion (from IDR 73,354 billion), suggesting reduced cash generation from core activities. Working capital remained tight, as reflected in the current ratio below 1. Inventory levels decreased to IDR 997 billion (from IDR 1,144 billion), indicating efficient inventory management. Overall, the company maintained cost control and asset efficiency, but the drop in operating cash flow warrants attention. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | In 2024, financial risk indicators showed some areas for attention. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly to 84.43%, and total liabilities rose, indicating a modest uptick in leverage. The current ratio improved but remained below 1 (82.17%), highlighting ongoing short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense increased to IDR (5,208) billion, and interest coverage declined to 825.48% (from 954.08%), though coverage remains strong. The effective tax rate was stable at 21.48%. No significant tax rate changes or extraordinary items are evident. The companyâ€™s risk profile is stable but warrants monitoring for liquidity and leverage, especially if margin pressures persist. | Financial risk indicators remained stable in 2023. The debt to equity ratio decreased slightly to 83.34%, and interest coverage was high at 954.08%, indicating strong ability to service debt. The current ratio was 77.71%, consistent with the prior year but below 1, highlighting potential short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense increased to IDR 4,652 billion (from IDR 4,033 billion), but was well covered by operating income. The effective tax rate decreased to 21.05%, reducing tax burden. No significant changes in leverage or tax policy were observed. The main early warning signal is the continued low current ratio, which could pose liquidity challenges if not addressed. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the companyâ€™s investment outflows decreased in 2024, which may signal a more cautious approach to capital expenditures or a focus on optimizing existing assets. Cash flow from operations remains strong and supports both increased dividends (IDR 17,683 billion) and a positive net cash position. Revenue by product/service shows a slight decline in Mobile and Consumer segments, but growth in Enterprise and WIB, suggesting a gradual shift in revenue mix. International revenue increased to IDR 8,905 billion, indicating expanding geographic diversification. Sustained cash generation and a stable capital base support ongoing dividend payments, but margin compression and slowing growth in core segments may temper future earnings expansion unless operational efficiency and new growth areas are enhanced. | Future performance prospects are supported by ongoing investment and stable cash flows. Net cash used in investing activities was IDR (36,909) billion, indicating continued capital investment, though at a slightly lower level than 2022. Net cash from financing improved to IDR (26,567) billion (from IDR (40,837) billion), suggesting reduced outflows. Dividend payments increased to IDR 16,603 billion, reflecting confidence in earnings sustainability. Revenue growth was driven by increases in the enterprise and WIB segments, and international revenue rose to IDR 8,059 billion (from IDR 7,323 billion), indicating potential for further geographic expansion. However, the decline in operating cash flow and persistent low current ratio suggest the need for careful liquidity management to sustain future growth and dividend policy. |
