## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Dayamitra Telekomunikasi Tbk. demonstrated a stable financial position with total assets increasing to IDR 58,139,702 million from IDR 57,278,715 million in 2023. However, total liabilities rose to IDR 24,753,008 million (up from IDR 23,160,363 million), outpacing the growth in assets and resulting in a decrease in shareholders' equity to IDR 33,386,694 million (from IDR 34,118,352 million). The current ratio declined to 28.05% from 31.10%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased to 74.14% (from 67.88%), reflecting a higher reliance on debt financing. Retained earnings grew to IDR 3,202,577 million, suggesting profit retention despite a lower equity base. Overall, while the company remains well-capitalized, the rising leverage and declining liquidity warrant close monitoring. | In 2023, PT Dayamitra Telekomunikasi Tbk. demonstrated a stable financial position with total assets of IDR 57,278,715 million, a modest increase from 2022. Shareholders' equity also rose slightly to IDR 34,118,352 million, indicating continued capital accumulation. Total liabilities increased to IDR 23,160,363 million, with current liabilities rising to IDR 11,124,294 million and non-current liabilities remaining relatively stable. The current ratio declined sharply to 31.10% from 77.22% in 2022, signaling a significant reduction in liquidity and a potential short-term solvency concern. The debt to equity ratio edged up to 67.88%, reflecting a marginally higher reliance on debt financing. Retained earnings increased to IDR 2,599,187 million, supporting equity growth. Overall, while the company maintains a strong asset base and equity position, the marked drop in liquidity warrants close monitoring. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved in 2024, with revenue rising to IDR 9,307,786 million (from IDR 8,683,800 million). Gross profit increased to IDR 4,801,056 million, and operating income reached IDR 4,178,946 million. Gross margin expanded to 51.58% (from 49.23%), and operating margin improved to 44.90% (from 42.35%), indicating enhanced cost control and operational leverage. However, net profit margin slightly decreased to 22.64% (from 23.15%), suggesting higher non-operating expenses or tax impacts. Return on equity rose to 6.24% and return on assets to 3.65%, both showing improved efficiency in generating returns. The effective tax rate increased to 6.96% (from 6.14%), contributing to the marginally lower net margin. Overall, earnings quality remains strong, with robust operating performance offset by higher interest and tax expenses. | Profitability improved in 2023, with revenue rising to IDR 8,683,800 million (up from IDR 7,728,930 million in 2022). Gross profit increased to IDR 4,275,245 million, and operating income reached IDR 3,677,590 million. Net profit grew to IDR 2,010,328 million. Margins strengthened: gross margin rose to 49.23%, operating margin to 42.35%, and net profit margin to 23.15%, all slightly higher than 2022. Return on equity (ROE) was 5.91% and return on assets (ROA) was 3.54%, indicating moderate returns on capital and assets. The effective tax rate decreased to 6.14%, supporting net profitability. The earnings quality appears robust, with improved margins and profit growth, though the high interest expense (IDR 1,185,105 million) is notable. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency strengthened in 2024. Asset turnover improved to 16.13% (from 15.29%), reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased significantly to IDR 6,632,221 million (from IDR 5,206,963 million), indicating strong cash generation from core activities. Operating expenses were well-contained, rising only modestly to IDR 622,110 million. The company reduced its net cash outflows from investing and financing activities, with net cash from investing at (IDR 3,489,876 million) and net cash from financing at (IDR 3,436,111 million), both lower outflows than in 2023. The net decrease in cash was minimal at (IDR 293,766 million), a substantial improvement over the prior year. Working capital management appears stable, though the slight decline in current assets and current ratio suggests some tightening. | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2023. Cost of goods sold increased in line with revenue, but gross and operating margins improved, indicating effective cost control. Operating expenses rose to IDR 597,655 million, but were well-contained relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover was 15.29%, suggesting moderate asset utilization. Net cash from operations was IDR 5,206,963 million, a decrease from 2022, indicating some pressure on cash generation. Working capital appears constrained, as reflected in the sharp drop in current assets and the current ratio. Net cash used in investing and financing activities decreased compared to 2022, but the company still experienced a significant net cash outflow (IDR 5,457,156 million). Dividend payments remained stable at IDR 1,767,219 million. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a moderate increase in leverage, with the debt to equity ratio rising to 74.14%. The current ratio's decline to 28.05% signals reduced liquidity, though still at a manageable level. Interest expense remained high at IDR 1,191,046 million, but interest coverage improved to 350.86% (from 310.32%), indicating a stronger ability to service debt. The effective tax rate increased to 6.96%, slightly impacting net profitability. No inventory data is available, limiting assessment of inventory risk. The company’s higher liabilities and lower equity base increase sensitivity to interest rate or refinancing risks, but strong operating cash flow and interest coverage provide a buffer against immediate financial distress. | Key financial risks in 2023 include a substantial decline in liquidity, as evidenced by the current ratio falling to 31.10%. This suggests potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly to 67.88%, indicating a marginal rise in leverage. Interest expense surged to IDR 1,185,105 million, and interest coverage dropped significantly to 310.32% from an exceptionally high level in 2022, though it remains adequate. The effective tax rate decreased, which may not be sustainable. The reduction in net cash from operations and persistent net cash outflows highlight ongoing cash flow risks. No inventory data is available, limiting analysis of working capital composition. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company’s increased investment outflows (though reduced from 2023) and strong operating cash flow suggest ongoing capital expenditure to support growth, particularly in its core telecommunication tower lease segment, which accounted for the majority of revenue (IDR 8,673,679 million). The reduction in dividends paid (IDR 1,504,281 million) may indicate a more conservative payout policy to preserve cash for reinvestment or debt management. Sustained cash flow from operations and improved asset turnover support the sustainability of operations. However, the rising leverage and declining liquidity highlight the need for prudent financial management. The absence of geographic revenue breakdown limits regional growth assessment, but the product/service mix remains stable. Overall, the company is positioned for continued growth, provided it manages its capital structure and liquidity risks effectively. | Looking ahead, the company’s investment outflows decreased to IDR 6,555,803 million, suggesting a more measured approach to capital expenditure. Cash flow from operations, while still positive, declined, raising questions about sustainability if current trends persist. Dividend policy remained unchanged, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns. The core business of telecommunication tower leasing continues to dominate revenue, growing to IDR 8,059,527 million, while other revenue streams declined. The lack of geographic revenue data limits regional growth analysis. To support future performance, the company may need to address liquidity constraints and ensure that operational cash flows are sufficient to cover investments and dividends. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Mitratel's primary business model is based on the leasing of telecommunications towers and related digital infrastructure services.

(19.75%), and PT XL Axiata Tbk. (10.26%). Mitratel's business model is asset-heavy, focusing on expanding its tower and fiber optic portfolio through both organic growth (new tower construction) and inorganic growth (acquisitions), and it leverages its extensive national footprint—especially outside Java—to support the expansion of Indonesia's digital economy. |
| Market Position | Mitratel is the market leader in Indonesia's telecommunications infrastructure industry, holding the largest market share in the sector. As of 2024, Mitratel operated 39,404 towers (a 3.7% increase YoY), with an estimated market share of 37%, making it the largest tower provider in Southeast Asia. The company also manages 59,868 tenants and 51,039 km of fiber optic network, with 59% of towers located outside Java, demonstrating strong national coverage and successful penetration into high-growth regions. Mitratel collaborates with all major mobile network operators in Indonesia (Telkomsel, Indosat, XL Axiata), with its top three customers accounting for 85% of consolidated revenue (Telkomsel 53%, Indosat 20%, XL Axiata 12%). The company is recognized for strong operational growth, the highest tower and tenant growth in Indonesia, and a healthy tenancy ratio of 1.52x.

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Company faces intense competition and price pressure in the telecommunication tower leasing industry, which may materially adversely affect rental prices, service revenues, and customer retention. Changes in domestic, regional, and global economic conditions, including volatility, inflation, geopolitical risks, and monetary policies, could negatively impact Indonesia's economy and the Company's business activities. Industry consolidation among customers may reduce demand and capital expenditures, affecting revenues. The Company also faces risks from evolving industry dynamics such as MNOs' capital expenditure efficiency and potential MNO consolidation. Mitigation measures include continuous monitoring of industry and economic developments, adaptive marketing and expansion strategies, selective tower site acquisition, maintaining communication with operators, exploring new business services, and strengthening human resources and business processes. | The Company faces intense competition and price pressures in the telecommunications tower rental industry, which may materially affect rental rates and service revenues, potentially causing existing customers not to renew leases or encouraging new customers to lease from competitors. The telecommunications industry is also challenged by a saturated mobile internet market with more mobile users than the population, requiring strategies like fixed mobile convergence (FMC) to sustain growth.
