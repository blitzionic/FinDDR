# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Pelita Teknologi Global Tbk's revenue increased from IDR 147,383,062,420 in 2022 to IDR 327,048,654,911 in 2023, then declined to IDR 197,222,283,012 in 2024. Gross margin was 13.93% in 2022, dropped to 8.90% in 2023, and partially recovered to 10.40% in 2024. By product/service, Operating System & SIM card was the dominant contributor, rising from IDR 122,540,937,500 in 2022 to IDR 300,723,176,393 in 2023, then falling to IDR 155,850,000,000 in 2024. Scratch Card revenue remained relatively stable (IDR 20,130,896,000 in 2022, IDR 19,474,378,688 in 2023, IDR 20,790,000,000 in 2024), while Fulfillment and Solution/Application revenues were minor but grew in 2024. By region, in 2023, PT Indosat Tbk accounted for IDR 324,412,854,911 of revenue, but no regional breakdown is available for 2024 or 2022. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 0.01% in 2022 to 0.55% in 2023 and 0.62% in 2024, indicating better cost control despite revenue volatility. Operating income rose from IDR 15,741,374 in 2022 to IDR 1,801,847,275 in 2023 and IDR 1,222,543,699 in 2024, while revenue fluctuated more sharply. Operating expenses increased from IDR 4,795,254,066 in 2022 to IDR 11,096,968,305 in 2023, then decreased to IDR 8,291,661,887 in 2024, reflecting some cost management efforts. The company maintained positive operating income throughout, but the low operating margin suggests limited pricing power or high fixed costs. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 25.35% in 2022 to 22.23% in 2023, then sharply to 32.18% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profit (net profit margin fell from 6.32% in 2022 to 3.76% in 2023, then slightly recovered to 4.12% in 2024). No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Pelita Teknologi Global Tbk demonstrated a stable financial position with total assets increasing to IDR 119,397,434,852 from IDR 113,911,852,586 in 2023. Shareholders' equity rose to IDR 65,486,808,655, reflecting improved retained earnings (IDR 28,847,954,704). Total liabilities slightly decreased to IDR 53,910,626,197, with a notable shift: current liabilities increased to IDR 37,575,948,068 while non-current liabilities dropped to IDR 16,334,678,129, indicating a move towards shorter-term obligations. The current ratio declined to 207.24% from 262.10%, but remains well above 100%, suggesting adequate liquidity, though the downward trend warrants monitoring. Debt to equity improved to 82.32% from 90.66%, indicating a more conservative capital structure. Inventories more than doubled to IDR 42,438,096,828, which may impact liquidity if not managed carefully. | In 2023, PT Pelita Teknologi Global Tbk demonstrated a significant strengthening of its financial position. Total assets increased to IDR 113,911,852,586 from IDR 66,758,330,063 in 2022, driven by both current assets (IDR 83,485,482,564) and non-current assets (IDR 30,426,370,022). Total liabilities rose to IDR 54,165,745,420, but at a much slower pace than assets, resulting in a substantial increase in shareholders' equity to IDR 59,746,107,166 (up from IDR 19,842,520,281). The current ratio improved markedly to 262.10% (from 153.91%), indicating strong liquidity and the ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio dropped sharply to 90.66% (from 236.44%), reflecting a much more conservative capital structure and reduced reliance on debt financing. Retained earnings also increased to IDR 23,386,719,135, supporting future growth and dividend capacity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 declined in absolute terms, with revenue falling sharply to IDR 197,222,283,012 from IDR 327,048,654,911 in 2023. Net profit also decreased to IDR 8,119,250,516 from IDR 12,306,322,915. However, margin analysis shows improvement: gross margin rose to 10.40% (from 8.90%), operating margin to 0.62% (from 0.55%), and net profit margin to 4.12% (from 3.76%), indicating better cost control and pricing discipline. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) both declined significantly to 12.97% and 6.96%, respectively, from 30.92% and 13.62%, reflecting lower earnings generation relative to the capital base. The effective tax rate increased to 32.18% from 22.23%, further pressuring net profitability. | Profitability in 2023 showed mixed signals. Revenue more than doubled to IDR 327,048,654,911 (from IDR 147,383,062,420), but cost of goods sold also rose sharply, compressing the gross margin to 8.90% (from 13.93%). Operating margin improved to 0.55% (from 0.01%), and net profit margin, while lower at 3.76% (from 6.32%), still resulted in a higher absolute net profit of IDR 12,306,322,915 (up from IDR 9,315,490,755). Return on equity (ROE) was strong at 30.92%, and return on assets (ROA) was 13.62%, indicating effective use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate decreased to 22.23% (from 25.35%), supporting net profitability. Overall, while margins narrowed due to higher costs, the company delivered robust earnings growth and high returns on equity and assets. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency weakened in 2024. Asset turnover dropped to 169.07% from 362.04%, indicating less effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations fell sharply to IDR 6,890,000,000 from IDR 23,250,000,000, suggesting reduced cash conversion from earnings. Working capital management is challenged by a significant increase in inventories and higher current liabilities, which, combined with lower current assets, contributed to the declining current ratio. Operating expenses decreased to IDR 8,291,661,887 from IDR 11,096,968,305, supporting margin improvements. However, net cash from investing activities became more negative at (IDR 17,120,000,000), indicating increased capital expenditures or investments. Cash from financing also decreased to IDR 8,140,000,000. Dividend payments increased to IDR 2,461,264,583, despite lower net profit and cash flow. | Operational efficiency improved in several areas. Asset turnover was high at 362.04%, indicating strong utilization of the asset base to generate revenue. Net cash from operations turned positive at IDR 23,250,000,000 (from negative IDR 15,735,687,649 in 2022), reflecting improved working capital management and cash generation from core activities. Inventory increased to IDR 18,539,433,669, but remained proportionate to revenue growth. Operating expenses rose to IDR 11,096,968,305 (from IDR 4,795,254,066), but were offset by higher revenues. Net cash from investing was negative (IDR -5,610,000,000), indicating ongoing investment, while net cash from financing was positive at IDR 18,450,000,000, supporting liquidity. The company also paid dividends of IDR 1,861,628,457, reflecting confidence in cash flow sustainability. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show some deterioration. The current ratio, while still strong, declined, and the increase in current liabilities alongside a large inventory build-up could strain liquidity if sales do not recover. Interest coverage fell to 52.12% from 86.39%, indicating reduced ability to service debt from operating income. The debt to equity ratio improved, but the shift towards more current liabilities may increase refinancing risk. The effective tax rate rose sharply, impacting net profit. The significant drop in asset turnover and cash from operations, combined with higher investment outflows, could signal early warning signs of operational or market challenges. No geographic revenue breakdown is available for 2024, limiting risk assessment from customer concentration. | Financial risk indicators improved significantly in 2023. The current ratio of 262.10% signals strong short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio fell to 90.66%, reducing leverage risk. Interest expense decreased to IDR 2,085,823,257 (from IDR 3,290,041,013), and interest coverage improved dramatically to 86.39% (from 0.48%), indicating a much greater ability to service debt. The effective tax rate declined to 22.23%, reducing tax burden risk. No material increase in non-current liabilities was observed. The company’s improved capital structure and liquidity position, along with strong interest coverage, suggest reduced financial risk and enhanced resilience. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company’s increased investment outflows in 2024 suggest a focus on growth or capacity expansion, but the sustainability of cash flows is a concern given the sharp drop in operating cash and profitability. The higher dividend payout, despite lower earnings and cash generation, may not be sustainable if current trends persist. The surge in inventories could either support future sales growth or risk obsolescence if demand does not rebound. Revenue by product/service shows a shift, with Fulfillment revenue increasing significantly, while the core Operating System & SIM card segment declined. This may indicate a strategic pivot or changing market dynamics. The absence of geographic revenue data for 2024 limits insight into customer or market diversification. Overall, future performance will depend on the company’s ability to restore revenue growth, manage working capital, and realize returns on recent investments. | The company’s strong cash flow from operations, positive net cash position (net increase in cash of IDR 36,092,664,397), and ongoing investment activity (net investing cash outflow of IDR 5,610,000,000) indicate a focus on growth and sustainability. The payment of dividends demonstrates management’s confidence in future cash flows. Revenue concentration is high, with PT Indosat Tbk accounting for the vast majority of 2023 revenue (IDR 324,412,854,911), which may present a concentration risk but also signals a strong relationship with a key client. The significant increase in retained earnings and equity provides a solid foundation for future expansion, while the improved capital structure and liquidity support ongoing investment and potential for further dividend payments. Continued monitoring of cost control and margin management will be important for sustaining profitability as the company grows. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
