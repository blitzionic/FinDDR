# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Airtel Africa plc's revenue increased from $4,714m in 2022 to $5,255m in 2023, but declined to $4,979m in 2024. Gross margin was exceptionally high at 94.85% in 2022, then normalized to 49.00% in 2023 and 48.76% in 2024, indicating a significant change in cost structure or accounting. By product/service, Voice revenue decreased from $2,491m in 2023 to $2,179m in 2024, Data revenue slightly declined from $1,787m to $1,734m, while Airtel Money grew from $692m to $837m. By region, Nigeria mobile services revenue dropped from $2,128m in 2023 to $1,503m in 2024, while East Africa mobile services increased from $1,508m to $1,622m, and Francophone Africa mobile services rose from $1,090m to $1,213m. Mobile money revenue also increased from $692m in 2023 to $837m in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin remained stable, at 32.56% in 2022, 33.43% in 2023, and 32.94% in 2024. Operating income followed revenue trends, rising from $1,535m in 2022 to $1,757m in 2023, then falling to $1,640m in 2024. Operating expenses were $3,189m in 2022, dropping sharply to $818m in 2023 and $788m in 2024, suggesting a major cost restructuring or reclassification between 2022 and 2023. Despite revenue and gross profit declines in 2024, operating efficiency was maintained, indicating effective cost management in the face of top-line pressure. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate was volatile, at 38.32% in 2022, dropping to 27.47% in 2023, and turning negative at (41.27%) in 2024, which contributed to a net loss of $(89)m in 2024 despite positive operating income. No non-recurring items are explicitly listed in the data. The negative effective tax rate in 2024 is a significant external factor that adversely impacted net profitability, reversing the net profit of $750m in 2023 and $755m in 2022. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Airtel Africa plc experienced a notable contraction in its balance sheet. Total assets declined to $9,861m from $11,166m in 2023, primarily due to a reduction in non-current assets ($7,569m vs $9,268m). Current assets increased to $2,292m (2023: $1,898m), but current liabilities also rose to $4,046m (2023: $3,572m), resulting in a current ratio of 56.65%, only a slight improvement from 53.14% in 2023, but still indicating weak short-term liquidity. Total liabilities increased to $7,561m (2023: $7,358m), while shareholders' equity dropped sharply to $2,160m (2023: $3,635m), reflecting the net loss for the year. The debt to equity ratio surged to 350.05% from 202.42%, highlighting a significant increase in financial leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2024 is characterized by increased leverage, reduced equity buffer, and persistent liquidity constraints. | In 2023, Airtel Africa plc demonstrated a moderate expansion in its asset base, with total assets rising to $11,166 million from $10,364 million in 2022. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in non-current assets ($9,268 million in 2023 vs $8,367 million in 2022), while current assets slightly declined ($1,898 million in 2023 vs $1,997 million in 2022). Total liabilities increased to $7,358 million (from $6,715 million), with both current and non-current liabilities rising, indicating a higher reliance on debt financing. The current ratio decreased to 53.14% from 64.99%, signaling a weakening in short-term liquidity. Shareholders' equity remained stable at $3,635 million (vs $3,649 million), while retained earnings increased to $3,902 million, reflecting profit retention. The debt to equity ratio rose to 202.42% (from 184.02%), highlighting a more leveraged capital structure. Overall, while the company expanded its asset base and retained more earnings, its liquidity position and leverage worsened in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability deteriorated significantly in 2024. Revenue fell to $4,979m from $5,255m in 2023. Gross profit decreased to $2,428m (2023: $2,575m), with gross margin slightly lower at 48.76% (2023: 49.00%). Operating income declined to $1,640m (2023: $1,757m), and operating margin slipped to 32.94% (2023: 33.43%). Most notably, net profit turned negative at $(89)m, compared to a $750m profit in 2023, resulting in a net profit margin of (1.79%) versus 14.27% previously. Return on equity and return on assets both turned negative, at (3.07%) and (0.85%) respectively, compared to positive returns in 2023. The sharp increase in interest expense ($1,741m vs $852m) was a key driver of the net loss, overwhelming operating profitability. The effective tax rate was negative at (41.27%), reflecting the pre-tax loss. Overall, earnings quality in 2024 was poor, with negative bottom-line results and eroded returns. | Airtel Africa's revenue grew to $5,255 million in 2023, up from $4,714 million in 2022, indicating robust top-line growth. However, gross profit declined sharply to $2,575 million (from $4,471 million), and the gross margin dropped significantly to 49.00% from 94.85%, suggesting a substantial increase in cost of goods sold. Operating income improved to $1,757 million (from $1,535 million), and the operating margin slightly increased to 33.43% (from 32.56%), reflecting effective control over operating expenses, which fell to $818 million (from $3,189 million). Net profit remained stable at $750 million (vs $755 million), but the net profit margin decreased to 14.27% (from 16.02%), indicating some pressure on bottom-line profitability. Return on equity was strong at 20.59%, and return on assets was 6.97%, both indicating efficient use of capital. The effective tax rate decreased to 27.47% (from 38.32%), supporting net earnings. Overall, while revenue and operating efficiency improved, the sharp decline in gross margin and net margin signals challenges in cost management and earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2024. Cost of goods sold decreased to $2,551m (2023: $2,680m), and operating expenses were reduced to $788m (2023: $818m), indicating some cost control. Asset turnover was slightly lower at 47.36% (2023: 48.82%), suggesting marginally less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations was stable at $2,259m (2023: $2,229m), indicating continued strong cash generation from core activities despite the net loss. Working capital remained negative, as current liabilities exceeded current assets, but the gap narrowed slightly. Net cash used in investing increased to $(1,228)m (2023: $(1,026)m), suggesting higher capital expenditures or investments. Net cash used in financing decreased to $(844)m (2023: $(1,139)m), and dividends paid increased to $212m (2023: $195m). The company achieved a higher net increase in cash ($187m vs $64m), reflecting prudent cash management. Overall, while cash flow from operations remained robust, asset utilization and working capital efficiency were under pressure. | Operationally, Airtel Africa increased its net cash from operations to $2,229 million (from $2,011 million), demonstrating improved cash generation. Asset turnover was 48.82%, indicating moderate efficiency in utilizing assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses were significantly reduced to $818 million (from $3,189 million), contributing to higher operating income. However, the increase in cost of goods sold and the resulting drop in gross margin point to rising input or service delivery costs. Working capital efficiency appears challenged, as current liabilities rose faster than current assets, and the current ratio declined. Net cash used in investing activities increased to $(1,026) million (from $(557) million), suggesting higher capital expenditures or investments. Net cash used in financing activities decreased to $(1,139) million (from $(1,607) million), indicating reduced outflows for debt repayment or dividends. The company achieved a positive net increase in cash of $64 million (vs a decrease of $153 million in 2022), reflecting improved cash flow management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk increased in 2024. The debt to equity ratio rose sharply to 350.05% (2023: 202.42%), indicating much higher leverage and reduced equity cushion. Interest expense more than doubled to $1,741m, and interest coverage fell to 94.20% (2023: 206.22%), signaling a much weaker ability to service debt from operating income. The current ratio, though slightly improved, remained below 1 (56.65%), highlighting ongoing liquidity risk. The negative net profit and negative returns on equity and assets further underscore heightened financial vulnerability. The effective tax rate turned negative due to pre-tax losses, and the company’s reduced equity base increases sensitivity to further losses or asset write-downs. Overall, the company faces elevated financial risk from high leverage, increased interest burden, and weak liquidity. | Key financial risks in 2023 include increased leverage, as evidenced by the higher debt to equity ratio (202.42%) and rising total liabilities. The current ratio's decline to 53.14% signals weaker liquidity and a potential risk in meeting short-term obligations. Interest expense nearly doubled to $852 million (from $441 million), and interest coverage fell to 206.22% (from 348.07%), indicating reduced ability to service debt from operating income. While the effective tax rate decreased, which is favorable, the sharp increase in cost of goods sold and the drop in gross margin may point to inflationary pressures or cost structure issues. The company’s reliance on debt financing and lower liquidity are early warning signs that warrant close monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, several factors will influence Airtel Africa’s financial trajectory. Investment activity increased, as seen in higher net cash outflows from investing, which could support future growth if returns materialize. However, the sustainability of cash flows is a concern given the net loss and high interest expense, despite stable operating cash generation. The company maintained and slightly increased its dividend payout ($212m), which may not be sustainable if losses persist. Segment data shows growth in Airtel Money revenue ($837m vs $692m) and in East and Francophone Africa mobile services, partially offsetting declines in Voice and Nigeria mobile services. This suggests potential for future growth in digital and mobile money services and in certain regions. However, the overall revenue decline and increased financial risk highlight the need for careful capital allocation and risk management to restore profitability and strengthen the balance sheet. | Looking ahead, Airtel Africa's increased investment outflows ($(1,026) million in 2023 vs $(557) million in 2022) suggest ongoing capital expenditure, potentially for network expansion or technology upgrades, which could support future growth. The positive net cash from operations and a modest increase in dividends ($195 million vs $169 million) indicate a sustainable cash flow and a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue growth was broad-based across all major segments and geographies, with notable increases in Voice, Data, and Airtel Money, as well as in Nigeria and East Africa. However, the sharp decline in gross margin and increased leverage may constrain future profitability if not addressed. Sustained investment in high-growth segments like Airtel Money and continued geographic expansion, coupled with improved cost control, will be critical for maintaining financial health and supporting future performance. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Airtel Africa operates a multi-segment business model focused on providing telecommunications and financial services across 14 markets in sub-Saharan Africa. The company generates revenue primarily through the provision of mobile telecommunications services (voice, data, messaging, and value-added services) and mobile money services. Service revenue, which constitutes the vast majority of total revenue ($4,965m out of $4,979m in FY24), is derived from usage and subscription charges for voice, data, messaging, and value-added services, as well as customer onboarding charges. The majority of customers subscribe to services on a pre-paid basis, with 99.3% of customers using pre-paid services. Revenue is recognized over time as services are provided, and customers primarily pay in advance. Mobile money services generate revenue through commissions from merchants for facilitating recharges, bill payments, merchant payments, and money transfers between customer wallets. The company also earns revenue from interconnection/roaming charges for use of its network by other operators. Additional revenue streams include enterprise services (Airtel Business), fixed-line telephony, home broadband, data centres, and handset sales, though these are minor compared to core mobile and mobile money services. Airtel Africa leverages a unique and extensive distribution network of over 3.3 million retail touchpoints, including more than 109,000 exclusive outlets, to reach and serve its 152.7 million customers.
