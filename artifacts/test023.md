# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Rolls-Royce Holdings plc's revenue demonstrated strong growth over the period, rising from EUR 13,520 million in 2022 to EUR 16,486 million in 2023 and reaching EUR 18,909 million in 2024. Gross profit increased from EUR 2,757 million in 2022 to EUR 3,620 million in 2023 and EUR 4,221 million in 2024, with gross margin improving from 20.39% in 2022 to 21.96% in 2023 and 22.32% in 2024. By product/service, Civil Aerospace was the largest contributor, growing from EUR 5,686 million in 2022 to EUR 7,348 million in 2023 and EUR 9,040 million in 2024. Defence and Power Systems also showed steady increases, with Defence rising from EUR 3,660 million in 2022 to EUR 4,522 million in 2024, and Power Systems from EUR 3,347 million to EUR 4,271 million over the same period. Geographically, Europe remained the largest region, with revenue increasing from EUR 4,749 million in 2022 to EUR 6,571 million in 2024, while North America grew from EUR 4,601 million to EUR 5,939 million, and Asia from EUR 2,503 million to EUR 3,893 million. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved significantly, rising from 6.19% in 2022 to 11.79% in 2023 and 15.37% in 2024. Operating income increased from EUR 837 million in 2022 to EUR 1,944 million in 2023 and EUR 2,906 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and indicating enhanced operational leverage. Operating expenses were reduced from EUR 1,968 million in 2022 to EUR 1,849 million in 2023 and further to EUR 1,487 million in 2024, reflecting effective cost management. The combination of rising gross profit and declining operating expenses contributed to the substantial improvement in operating efficiency. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate fluctuated notably, standing at 20.51% in 2022, turning negative at (0.95%) in 2023, and then settling at 11.19% in 2024. The negative effective tax rate in 2023, with an income tax expense of EUR (23) million, contributed to an unusually high net profit margin of 14.58% that year. In 2022, a high tax expense of EUR (308) million contributed to a net loss of EUR (1,274) million. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Rolls-Royce Holdings plc demonstrated an expansion in its asset base, with total assets rising to EUR 35,686 million from EUR 31,512 million in 2023. Current assets increased to EUR 21,473 million, outpacing the growth in current liabilities (EUR 16,763 million), resulting in an improved current ratio of 128.10% (up from 121.34%), indicating stronger short-term liquidity. However, total liabilities also increased to EUR 36,567 million, and shareholders' equity declined sharply to EUR 912 million from EUR 3,681 million, reflecting a significant weakening of the capital structure. The debt to equity ratio deteriorated substantially to 4009.54% (from 954.66%), highlighting a heavy reliance on debt financing and a thin equity cushion. Retained earnings improved (less negative) to EUR -4,409 million from EUR -7,190 million, but remain negative. Overall, while liquidity improved, the capital structure is highly leveraged and equity is at a low level, raising concerns about long-term financial resilience. | In 2023, Rolls-Royce Holdings plc demonstrated an improvement in its financial health. Total assets increased to EUR 31,512 million from EUR 29,450 million in 2022, driven by higher current assets (EUR 18,111 million vs. EUR 16,011 million), while non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities decreased slightly to EUR 35,141 million from EUR 35,466 million, with a notable reduction in non-current liabilities (EUR 20,160 million vs. EUR 21,548 million), though current liabilities increased (EUR 14,926 million vs. EUR 13,918 million). Shareholders' equity improved but remained negative at EUR (3,681) million, up from EUR (6,016) million, reflecting a narrowing equity deficit. The current ratio improved to 121.34% from 115.04%, indicating better short-term liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio worsened to (954.66%) from (589.53%), highlighting a highly leveraged capital structure and ongoing balance sheet risk due to negative equity. Retained earnings also improved but remained negative at EUR (7,190) million. Overall, while liquidity and asset growth improved, the company remains highly leveraged with negative equity, signaling ongoing capital structure challenges. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 showed mixed signals. Revenue grew robustly by 14.7% to EUR 18,909 million. Gross profit increased to EUR 4,221 million, with gross margin slightly higher at 22.32%. Operating income rose significantly to EUR 2,906 million, and the operating margin improved to 15.37% (from 11.79%), reflecting effective cost control at the operating level. However, net profit only marginally increased to EUR 2,484 million (from EUR 2,404 million), and the net profit margin declined to 13.14% (from 14.58%), mainly due to a sharp rise in interest expense (EUR 1,224 million vs. EUR 681 million) and a normalization of the effective tax rate to 11.19% (from -0.95%). Return on equity surged to 108.16% (from -49.58%), but this is largely a function of the much lower equity base rather than improved underlying profitability. Return on assets slightly decreased to 7.39%. Overall, while operational profitability improved, bottom-line growth was constrained by higher financing and tax costs, and the quality of earnings is affected by the capital structure. | Profitability rebounded strongly in 2023. Revenue rose to EUR 16,486 million from EUR 13,520 million, a 22% increase. Gross profit increased to EUR 3,620 million (from EUR 2,757 million), and gross margin improved to 21.96% (from 20.39%). Operating income more than doubled to EUR 1,944 million (from EUR 837 million), with operating margin rising to 11.79% (from 6.19%). Net profit swung to EUR 2,404 million from a loss of EUR (1,274) million, and net profit margin improved to 14.58% from (9.42%). Return on assets was 7.89% (2022: N/A), and return on equity, while negative due to negative equity, was (49.58%). The effective tax rate dropped sharply to (0.95%) from 20.51%, indicating a very low tax burden in 2023. Interest expense fell significantly to EUR (681) million from EUR 2,775 million, and interest coverage improved to 285.46% from 30.16%. Overall, 2023 saw a marked turnaround in profitability and earnings quality, with strong margin expansion and a return to net profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024. Asset turnover increased to 56.28% (from 54.09%), indicating better utilization of the asset base to generate revenue. Operating expenses decreased to EUR 1,487 million (from EUR 1,849 million), supporting higher operating margins. Net cash from operations rose significantly to EUR 3,782 million (from EUR 2,485 million), reflecting stronger cash generation. Inventory levels increased modestly to EUR 5,092 million, but this appears proportionate to revenue growth. Net cash used in investing activities increased slightly to EUR -831 million, suggesting ongoing investment. Net cash from financing activities turned more negative at EUR -1,047 million, possibly reflecting debt repayments or other outflows. The net increase in cash was EUR 1,904 million, up from EUR 1,210 million, indicating improved cash flow. Working capital management appears effective, with current assets growth outpacing current liabilities. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023. Cost of goods sold increased to EUR (12,866) million from EUR 10,763 million, but revenue growth outpaced cost increases, resulting in higher gross profit and margin. Operating expenses decreased to EUR (1,849) million from EUR 1,968 million, reflecting effective cost control. Asset turnover was 54.09% (2022: N/A), indicating improved utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations rose to EUR 2,485 million from EUR 1,524 million, showing stronger cash generation. Working capital improved, as evidenced by higher current assets and a better current ratio. Net cash from investing was negative at EUR (726) million (vs. positive EUR 826 million in 2022), suggesting increased investment activity. Net cash from financing was less negative at EUR (549) million (vs. EUR (2,540) million), and the company achieved a net increase in cash of EUR 1,210 million (vs. a decrease of EUR (190) million in 2022). Inventory levels were stable (EUR 4,848 million vs. EUR 4,708 million). Overall, the company demonstrated improved operational efficiency through better cost control, higher cash generation, and more effective asset utilization. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 signal elevated risk. The debt to equity ratio soared to 4009.54%, reflecting extreme leverage and a very thin equity buffer. Interest expense nearly doubled, and interest coverage declined to 237.42% (from 285.46%), though still above critical levels. The current ratio improved to 128.10%, suggesting adequate liquidity in the short term. The effective tax rate normalized to 11.19% from a negative rate, increasing the tax burden. The sharp drop in equity and persistent negative retained earnings highlight vulnerability to losses or further shocks. The company’s reliance on debt financing increases sensitivity to interest rate changes and refinancing risk. No dividend payments are reported, which may be a response to the need to conserve cash. Overall, the main risks are high leverage, low equity, and increased interest costs. | Despite improved profitability, financial risk remains elevated in 2023. The debt to equity ratio deteriorated further to (954.66%), reflecting the ongoing issue of negative equity and high leverage. However, interest expense dropped significantly, and interest coverage improved to 285.46%, reducing short-term solvency risk. The current ratio improved to 121.34%, indicating adequate liquidity to cover short-term obligations. The effective tax rate fell to (0.95%), which may not be sustainable and could indicate the use of tax credits or loss carryforwards. While non-current liabilities decreased, current liabilities increased, which could pressure liquidity if not managed. The negative equity position and high leverage remain key early warning signals, and the company is still exposed to balance sheet risk despite operational improvements. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Rolls-Royce’s strong revenue growth across all major product lines and geographies in 2024, especially in Civil Aerospace and North America, provides a positive demand outlook. The company is investing (EUR -831 million net investing cash flow), which may support future growth. However, the sustainability of cash flow is challenged by high interest costs and a highly leveraged balance sheet. The absence of dividends suggests a focus on balance sheet repair. Improved operational cash flow and margin expansion are positives, but the thin equity base and high debt levels pose risks to future financial stability. Continued growth in retained earnings and further deleveraging will be critical. Segment and geographic diversification remain strengths, but financial policy will need to prioritize capital structure improvement to support long-term performance. | The company increased investment activity in 2023, as shown by negative net cash from investing (EUR (726) million), which may support future growth. Strong net cash from operations (EUR 2,485 million) and a net increase in cash (EUR 1,210 million) suggest improved cash flow sustainability. No dividends were paid in 2023 (N/A), likely reflecting a focus on balance sheet repair. Revenue growth was broad-based across all major product segments, with Civil Aerospace, Defence, and Power Systems all posting higher revenues. Geographically, revenue growth was strong in Europe (EUR 6,108 million vs. EUR 4,749 million), North America (EUR 5,098 million vs. EUR 4,601 million), and Asia (EUR 3,471 million vs. EUR 2,503 million), indicating diversified growth drivers. If operational improvements and investment are sustained, future performance could continue to improve, but high leverage and negative equity remain constraints on financial flexibility and dividend policy. |
