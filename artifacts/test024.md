## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Babcock International Group PLC demonstrated an improvement in overall financial health. Total assets increased to £3,580.1m from £3,309.9m in 2023, while total liabilities also rose to £3,174.0m from £2,939.0m. Shareholders' equity grew to £406.1m (from £370.9m), indicating a strengthening capital base. The current ratio improved slightly to 85.67% (from 84.90%), suggesting stable short-term liquidity, though it remains below the conventional benchmark of 100%. Debt to equity decreased marginally to 781.58% (from 792.40%), still indicating a highly leveraged capital structure. Retained earnings remain negative at (£1,523.9m), but the reduction in the deficit from (£1,568.8m) signals progress. Overall, the company is showing signs of balance sheet strengthening, but high leverage and negative retained earnings remain areas of concern. | In 2023, Babcock International Group PLC experienced a notable contraction in its balance sheet. Total assets declined significantly to £3,309.9m from £4,600.7m in 2022, driven by reductions in both current and non-current assets. Total liabilities also decreased to £2,939.0m from £3,899.2m, but the reduction in assets outpaced that of liabilities, resulting in a sharp drop in shareholders' equity to £370.9m (from £701.5m). The current ratio remained relatively stable at 84.90% (2022: 86.08%), indicating continued tight liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased substantially to 792.40% (2022: 555.84%), reflecting a more leveraged capital structure and a weaker equity base. Retained earnings further deteriorated to negative £1,568.8m, highlighting ongoing accumulated losses. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 is characterized by a shrinking asset base, high leverage, and persistent negative retained earnings, raising concerns about long-term solvency and balance sheet resilience. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved markedly in 2024. Revenue was relatively stable at £4,390.1m (vs. £4,438.6m in 2023), but gross profit increased to £4,386.6m, with an exceptional gross margin of 99.92% (up from 98.26%). Operating income rose sharply to £241.6m (from £45.5m), and net profit turned positive at £168.2m (from a loss of £33.3m). Operating and net profit margins improved to 5.50% and 3.83%, respectively, compared to 1.03% and (0.75%) in 2023. Return on equity surged to 43.29% (from -6.21%), and return on assets improved to 4.88% (from -0.84%), reflecting much stronger earnings quality and capital efficiency. The effective tax rate normalized to 22.38% (from an anomalous 637.10%), supporting the sustainability of net earnings. | Profitability weakened considerably in 2023. While revenue grew to £4,438.6m (up from £4,101.8m), net profit turned negative at (£33.3m) compared to a positive £167.9m in 2022. Gross profit increased to £4,361.2m, and the gross margin improved to 98.26% (2022: 95.96%), but this was offset by a sharp rise in operating expenses (£4,315.7m vs. £4,040.6m), resulting in a much lower operating income (£45.5m) and a drop in operating margin to 1.03% (2022: 5.53%). The net profit margin deteriorated to (0.75%) from 4.09%. Return on equity and return on assets were both negative at (6.21%) and (0.84%) respectively, indicating value erosion for shareholders and poor asset profitability. The effective tax rate spiked to 637.10%, further impacting net results. Overall, despite top-line growth, earnings quality declined due to higher costs, increased tax burden, and negative bottom-line performance. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency advanced in 2024. Operating expenses decreased to £4,145.0m (from £4,315.7m), indicating improved cost control. Asset turnover increased to 127.43% (from 112.22%), showing better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations rose to £314.7m (from £261.3m), and inventories increased to £187.4m (from £126.8m), which may reflect higher activity or inventory buildup. Net cash from investing turned negative at (£100.6m), suggesting increased investment activity, while net cash from financing outflows reduced significantly to (£85.5m) from (£666.1m). The company achieved a positive net increase in cash of £128.6m (vs. a decrease of £321.3m in 2023), highlighting improved cash flow management. | Operational efficiency showed mixed signals in 2023. Revenue growth was achieved across most segments and geographies, with asset turnover at 112.22%, suggesting improved utilization of a smaller asset base. Cost of goods sold turned negative, and gross profit rose, but operating expenses increased disproportionately, eroding operating income. Net cash from operations improved markedly to £261.3m (2022: £6.8m), indicating better cash conversion from core activities. However, net cash from investing fell to £83.5m (from £338.6m), and net cash from financing was a significant outflow at (£666.1m), leading to a net decrease in cash of (£321.3m). Working capital contracted as both current assets and liabilities declined. Inventory levels also fell slightly. While cash generation from operations improved, overall cash flow was negative, and the company relied less on external financing, possibly due to deleveraging or reduced access to capital. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Key financial risks persist despite improvements. The debt to equity ratio remains extremely high at 781.58%, indicating significant leverage and potential vulnerability to changes in credit conditions. However, interest expense decreased to £56.2m (from £70.5m), and interest coverage improved dramatically to 429.89% (from 64.54%), reducing immediate solvency risk. The current ratio, while slightly improved, remains below 1, suggesting ongoing liquidity risk. The effective tax rate normalized to 22.38%, reducing the risk of unexpected tax charges. While the company has made progress in profitability and cash flow, the high leverage and low liquidity ratios are early warning signals that require ongoing monitoring. | Financial risk indicators worsened in 2023. The debt to equity ratio surged to 792.40%, reflecting increased leverage and a shrinking equity base. The current ratio remained below 1 (84.90%), signaling ongoing liquidity risk. Interest coverage dropped sharply to 64.54% (2022: 282.09%), indicating reduced ability to service debt from operating income. The effective tax rate spiked to 637.10%, suggesting either one-off tax charges or adverse tax adjustments, which significantly impacted net profit. Retained earnings became more negative, and net profit turned to a loss, both warning signs for future financial stability. The combination of high leverage, weak liquidity, and deteriorating profitability heightens the company’s vulnerability to financial distress. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Babcock's increased investment outflows (£100.6m) suggest a focus on future growth or asset renewal. The positive net cash from operations and reduced financing outflows support cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments increased to £8.5m (from £2.2m), indicating growing confidence in earnings stability. Segment data shows a significant increase in Nuclear revenue (£1,520.9m vs. £1,179.2m), offsetting declines in Aviation (£341.5m vs. £802.7m), suggesting a strategic shift or market realignment. Geographically, UK revenue grew substantially to £3,081.1m (from £2,693.3m), while Rest of Europe declined sharply, indicating increased domestic focus. If operational improvements and investment are sustained, and leverage is managed, the company is positioned for continued financial recovery and potential growth, though high leverage remains a key risk to monitor. | Looking ahead, Babcock’s investment activity slowed, with net cash from investing dropping to £83.5m. The company paid slightly higher dividends (£2.2m), despite negative net profit and cash outflows, which may not be sustainable. Cash flow from operations improved, but overall cash decreased, and financing outflows were substantial, possibly reflecting debt repayments or reduced borrowing capacity. Revenue growth was broad-based, with increases in Marine, Nuclear, and most geographic regions, suggesting underlying demand remains robust. However, persistent losses, high leverage, and negative retained earnings pose significant challenges to future performance. Unless cost control and profitability improve, and the balance sheet is strengthened, the sustainability of cash flows and dividend policy is at risk. The company’s future financial trajectory will depend on its ability to restore earnings, manage leverage, and maintain operational cash generation. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Babcock operates primarily as a provider of engineering-based support services and product development, focusing on long-term contracts and multi-year frameworks with government departments, public bodies, highly regulated industries, and blue chip companies. The company generates revenue through the delivery of complex products and services, including through-life support, maintenance, engineering, infrastructure management, and specialist training for critical assets such as naval ships, submarines, military vehicles, and aircraft. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations in contracts are satisfied, typically over time, in line with IFRS 15. The majority of revenue is derived from long-term contracts, with a contract backlog of £10.3 billion providing visibility for future revenue. Babcock's business is organized into four main sectors: Marine, Nuclear, Land, and Aviation, with 74% of revenue coming from the defence sector. The company also engages in product development, manufacturing, and exports, particularly in the Marine sector. Payments are typically received according to pre-arranged schedules or upon achievement of milestones. Babcock leverages its technical capabilities, customer intimacy, and operational asset knowledge to deliver value-added, integrated solutions, often acting as a through-life capability partner for its customers. | The company operates primarily as a provider of complex engineering services and support solutions, with a strong focus on the defence sector (68% of FY23 revenue). Its business model is predominantly services-based, delivering through-life support, asset management, technical training, and critical programme support for defence and civil customers. Revenue is generated mainly from long-term contracts and multi-year frameworks with government and blue-chip clients, particularly in the UK, Australasia, France, Canada, and South Africa. The company also engages in the design, manufacturing, and integration of specialist equipment and technologies, but the majority of revenue comes from services such as maintenance, repair, overhaul, and training. Revenue recognition follows IFRS 15, with income derived from contracts with customers for goods and services, recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. The company maintains a significant contract backlog (£9.5 billion), providing a stable base of future revenue. Key sectors include Marine (36% of FY23 revenue), Nuclear (27%), Land (25%), and Aviation (10%). |
| Market Position | Babcock is the second largest supplier to the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD), with a strong embedded position in the UK, which accounts for approximately 60-70% of group revenue. The company is a critical supplier to governments in its core markets (UK, Australasia, France, Canada, and South Africa) and is recognized as a market leader in several segments, such as UK civilian armoured vehicles and nuclear submarine support. Babcock's portfolio is increasingly focused on defence, with 74% of group revenue and 78% of contract backlog in the defence sector. The company has a significant contract backlog (£10.3 billion), high barriers to entry due to its technical expertise and customer relationships, and is embedded in long-term programmes. Internationally, Babcock is expanding its presence, particularly in Australasia and Europe, and is forming strategic alliances to enter new markets. The company is differentiated by its ability to deliver complex, integrated solutions, its operational asset knowledge, and its track record of consistent delivery. While specific market share percentages are not provided, Babcock is described as a market leader or incumbent in key UK defence markets and a challenger with growing presence internationally. | The company is a major player in the UK and international defence support and engineering services market, with around 68-70% of its business in defence.

Specific market share percentages are not provided, but the company is described as having a critical role in global defence and security, and as a unique provider in UK nuclear services. Its competitive advantages include deep technical expertise, long-term customer relationships, and the ability to deliver integrated, value-add solutions focused on asset availability and affordability. |


# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Babcock faces market risks including reliance on winning and retaining large contracts primarily with government-owned or controlled customers, exposure to volatile markets with inflation, energy costs, and geopolitical tensions such as conflicts in the Middle East and South China Sea. These factors may disrupt supply chains, increase commodity prices, and cause demand volatility. Competition is intense with customers having significant bargaining power, potentially leading to contract cancellations, renegotiations, or preference for domestic or smaller suppliers. The company monitors political and economic developments globally and maintains customer intimacy to mitigate these risks. The risk appetite for market risks is medium, reflecting the need to secure a secure and assured pipeline for growth. | Babcock faces market risks including volatility in demand and competition within defence and emergency services sectors, where a limited number of customers hold significant market power. Risks arise from under-pricing or underestimating contract costs, inflationary pressures (notably labour costs), supply chain disruptions (exacerbated by geopolitical events such as the Ukraine conflict), and changes in government policies or budgets affecting contract opportunities and terms. Brexit has caused labour market disruptions impacting key skills availability. The Group mitigates these risks through portfolio diversification, ongoing customer dialogue, targeting aligned contracts, investing in innovation and people, and maintaining a public listing to support contract wins. Inflation risk is managed by including cost recovery mechanisms or index-linked pricing in contracts and offsetting unrecoverable labour cost increases through efficiencies. Emerging risks include geopolitical volatility and technological disruption, with controls in place to monitor and adapt to these factors. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include supply chain disruptions from natural hazards, geopolitical events, industrial action, cyber security threats, and part availability for aged customer assets. Business interruption risks arise from loss of key dependencies such as people, infrastructure, technology, and supply chain provisions, with potential major impacts on safety, financial stability, and reputation. The company operates in highly regulated environments requiring robust operational resilience programs including business continuity, emergency response, and crisis management. Risks also stem from contract and project performance due to long-term fixed-price contracts, complex integrated services, and supply chain vulnerabilities. Technological disruption, including digital change and AI risks, and safety, health, and environmental protection risks are also significant. Mitigations include enhanced risk management frameworks, emergency plans, IT disaster recovery, crisis communication protocols, supplier diversification, and continuous monitoring and training. | Operational risks include supply chain vulnerabilities such as macroeconomic conditions (high inflation, Brexit), disruption events (natural disasters, wars, strikes), cyber-attacks on suppliers, and part availability issues for aged customer assets. The Group manages operational resilience risks through multiple change programmes (new strategy, operating model, people strategy), business continuity and IT disaster recovery processes, and insurance coverage. Talent attraction and retention challenges due to evolving workforce dynamics are monitored closely. Climate-related physical risks (flooding, storms, extreme heat, forest fires) at key sites are assessed with mitigation plans integrated into business continuity. Technological disruption risks from digital change, data management, and new technologies are addressed via regular review of controls and change programme oversight. The Group has enhanced operational risk management capabilities, including a dedicated Enterprise Risk Management team and a Risk Committee overseeing principal risks. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks encompass foreign exchange risk from exposure to multiple currencies (EUR, USD, ZAR, AUD, CAD), interest rate risk related to floating and fixed rate debt, liquidity risk ensuring sufficient cash and committed credit facilities, credit risk from counterparties, and capital risk related to maintaining going concern status. The Group uses hedging instruments such as forward foreign currency contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and cash flow hedges to mitigate currency and interest rate risks. Treasury policies prohibit trading for profit and focus on risk management. Credit risk is managed by setting limits and using investment-grade counterparties. Liquidity is managed through cash forecasts and maintaining diversified funding sources. The risk appetite for financial risks is low to medium, with ongoing monitoring and adjustments to capital structure. | Financial risks encompass credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, and capital structure risk. Credit risk is managed by setting credit limits for non-government customers and financial institutions, performing credit checks, and transacting only with approved counterparties. Liquidity risk is mitigated by maintaining sufficient cash, committed credit facilities, and regular cash forecasting. Interest rate risk is managed through a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps, with 83% fixed rate debt as of March 2023. Foreign exchange risk arises from exposure to multiple currencies (EUR, USD, ZAR, AUD, CAD) and is mitigated by hedging all material transactional exposures using forward contracts and cross-currency swaps, with hedge accounting applied where appropriate. The Group monitors and reports currency exposures quarterly. Capital risk is managed by balancing debt and equity funding to safeguard going concern and maintain investment grade credit rating. The Group also manages pension scheme risks related to asset volatility, inflation, life expectancy, and regulatory changes. Financial risk management is supported by treasury policies prohibiting trading for profit and focusing on risk management. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks arise from operating in multiple highly regulated industries with complex legal and regulatory requirements including anti-bribery laws, export controls, tax, procurement rules, human rights, and data protection regulations. Non-compliance could lead to fines, criminal prosecution, loss of licenses, reputational damage, and loss of business opportunities. The company maintains internal policies, qualified personnel, and external advisors to ensure compliance. It has a low risk appetite for compliance failures and emphasizes ethical conduct through codes of conduct, whistleblowing mechanisms, and training. Regulatory compliance is critical for operational licenses, especially in nuclear and aviation sectors. The company also manages risks related to fraud, irregularities, and evolving corporate governance codes with dedicated risk and audit committees overseeing controls and compliance. | Compliance risks relate to adherence to laws, regulations, and standards across multiple jurisdictions, including anti-bribery, export controls, tax, procurement, human rights, data protection, aviation airworthiness, and environmental regulations. Non-compliance could result in fines, criminal prosecution, loss of licenses, reputational damage, contract debarment, and loss of business. The Group mitigates compliance risks through internal policies, qualified personnel, expert external advisors, and management systems with clear accountabilities. Ethics and Code of Business Conduct policies are enforced with mandatory training and whistleblowing mechanisms. Regulatory compliance is monitored by senior management and the Board, with regular reviews and investigations of reported concerns. The Group maintains positive relationships with regulators and integrates compliance into its risk management framework. Climate-related regulatory risks are also considered, with ongoing assessments and controls to address environmental obligations. |

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Risk assessment procedures | Babcock International Group PLC employs a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework aligned with ISO 31000 International Standard for Risk Management. Risk identification and evaluation are conducted through a structured process involving a Risk Committee that challenges principal risks throughout the year. The Group uses a consistently applied five-by-five risk-rating matrix assessing likelihood and impact to evaluate risks, with definitions ranging from 'Very unlikely' to 'Very likely' and impacts from 'Insignificant' to 'Severe'. Risk Registers are compiled at sector and Direct Reporting Country (DRC) levels using the Global ERM Framework to ensure consistency, describing risks, controls, and their effectiveness. The Group Risk function consolidates these registers to produce a Group risk profile including interconnectivities. Risk assessment includes top-down and bottom-up approaches, with risk conversations involving the Group Executive Committee and critical risk influencers. Emerging risks, including climate and fraud risks, are embedded into the risk registers. The Board annually reviews and approves the Corporate Risk Register and risk-rating matrix, and undertakes bi-annual deep dives on specific risks. The Risk Committee also commissions deep dives and emerging risk reports, and reviews high-impact, low-likelihood events such as 'black swan' and 'grey rhino' events. Climate-related risks are assessed quarterly by Group Risk and Environmental teams, considering physical and transition risks under different climate scenarios. The Group has introduced velocity ratings, risk appetite levels, key risk indicators, and red flag warning mechanisms. Risk training is delivered to senior leadership and risk assessors to improve risk maturity and culture. | Babcock International Group PLC employs a comprehensive risk management framework consistently across the Group, which includes a network of risk leads who compile sector and overseas operation risk registers using a common Group risk management framework. These registers describe risks, control measures, and rate their effectiveness. The Group consolidates these into a bi-annual risk-rating matrix assessing likelihood and impact on a five-by-five scale, reviewed by the Risk Committee quarterly and the Board annually. The Risk Committee challenges mitigation and control of Principal Risks and Uncertainties (PRUs) through an annual rolling programme and commissions deep dives and emerging risk reports. Climate-related risks are integrated into the Enterprise Risk Management Framework with quarterly reviews and annual reassessments of risk ratings and control effectiveness. The Board reviews and approves the Corporate Risk Register bi-annually, using a risk-rating matrix that considers probability and impact after controls and mitigations. The Group also uses quantitative scenario analysis for climate-related risks and severe but plausible downside scenarios for financial viability. The risk management framework includes top-down and bottom-up risk conversations with the Group Executive Committee and critical risk influencers. The Group uses a three lines of defence model for risk assurance: management controls, internal assurance activities, and independent assurance such as internal audits. |
| Control activities | The Group has implemented a robust internal control environment anchored by the Babcock Document of Controls, which acts as a risk and control matrix covering material reporting, financial, compliance, and operational controls. Controls are categorized as mandatory or expected, with bi-annual adherence reporting by business units. The Group has a multi-year internal control enhancement roadmap focusing on embedding 15 Blueprint Fundamental Controls (BFCs) related to significant financial reporting risks including bid controls, contract review, consolidation, pensions, taxation, and derivative reporting. Sector-level contract review controls have been matured and standardized, including enhanced control documentation and a single Contract Status Report. IT general controls have been enhanced, including privileged access controls, segregation of duties testing, and retirement of legacy systems, particularly focusing on the Neptune ERP system. The Group has policies covering health and safety, project management, information security, trade controls, contracting, financial transactions, and reporting. Fraud risk management is embedded in the risk framework with sector and DRC submissions, supported by training and independent reviews. The Group maintains a comprehensive scheme of delegated authorities and a whistleblowing line for reporting concerns. The Finance Business Services team supports process standardization and root cause analysis of financial misstatements. The Group also links executive remuneration to carbon emissions reduction targets as part of climate management controls. | The Group's control environment is anchored by the Babcock Document of Control, a comprehensive risk and control matrix introduced in FY21 and supplemented by the Blueprint of Control Improvements. Controls are categorized as mandatory or expected, with six-monthly adherence reporting and independent internal audit review. Key control enhancements under the Blueprint include 15 fundamental management review controls addressing significant contract management, commercial, and financial reporting risks. The Group has implemented a Global Project Management Framework standardizing project management and Integrated Project Controls processes. Policies cover health and safety, project management, information security, trade controls, contracting requirements, and accounting policies. The Group has established a new centre-led commercial function to optimize commercial risk management and a Finance Business Services Team to deliver standardized processes and controls. The Group maintains a comprehensive scheme of delegated authorities reviewed annually by the Board. Commercial and operational reviews, including quarterly Group Watchlist reviews for key contracts, are standardized. The Group has transitioned global banking services to BNP with enhanced cash management controls. The Group also maintains insurance programs and whistleblowing lines to support compliance and ethical conduct. The Group's Code of Conduct and Ethics policy set clear expectations for employee behavior, reinforced through training and reporting mechanisms. |
| Monitoring mechanisms | Monitoring of internal controls is conducted through multiple layers including the Audit Committee, Risk Committee, Group Executive Committee, and Internal Audit. The Audit Committee reviews and monitors the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and internal control environment, approves annual audit plans, and receives regular updates on the internal control roadmap and fraud risk management. The Risk Committee provides executive leadership and oversight of the ERM Framework, challenges principal risks and mitigations, commissions deep dives, and reviews emerging risks. The Group Executive Committee sponsors principal risks and ensures risk management integration. Internal Audit provides independent and objective assurance on governance, risk management, and internal controls, reporting findings and progress against audit plans to the Audit Committee. The Group uses a three lines of defence model: first line is management controls and oversight; second line is internal assurance including Group risk management and compliance teams; third line is independent assurance via Internal Audit. The Document of Controls adherence is reported bi-annually and independently verified. The Group Risk function coordinates risk registers, delivers risk training, and facilitates risk conversations. External audit provides additional assurance and challenges control deficiencies. The Board and Audit Committee conduct annual reviews of risk management and internal control effectiveness. Climate-related risks are reviewed quarterly by Group Risk and Environmental teams and reported to the Audit Committee and Board. The Group also uses key risk indicators, red flag mechanisms, and risk visualization reporting tools to support monitoring. | The Audit Committee, composed of independent Non-Executive Directors including a designated financial expert, oversees the Group's internal financial control, risk management, and financial reporting systems. It reviews and monitors the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework and internal controls, approves annual audit plans for external and internal audits, and receives regular reports from management, internal audit (transitioning from outsourced BDO to an internal team), and external auditors (Deloitte). The Committee meets regularly with audit partners without management present to discuss matters freely. The Group Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the Group Executive Committee chaired by the Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, provides executive leadership and oversight of risk management, acting as an interface between the Audit Committee and the business, and keeps PRUs under continual challenge and review. Internal audit conducts risk-based reviews, financial control audits, and follow-ups on recommendations, reporting findings to the Audit Committee. The Board reviews the effectiveness of internal controls formally at least annually, supported by reports from the Audit Committee and management. Sector letters of representation are reviewed bi-annually to identify control weaknesses. External regulators and bodies regularly inspect parts of the Group. The Group employs a three lines of defence assurance model: management controls, internal assurance functions, and independent assurance through internal and external audits. The Audit Committee also monitors the transition of internal audit from outsourcing to insourcing and approves the internal audit plan annually. |
| Identified material weaknesses or deficiencies | In prior years, control deficiencies were identified primarily related to inconsistent implementation and documentation of contract review controls across sectors, IT environment weaknesses including privileged access and password controls, and inaccuracies in the financial close process. In FY24, progress was made in remediating these deficiencies, including embedding the Blueprint Fundamental Controls and enhancing sector-level contract review controls. However, findings remain regarding the operation of these controls and retention of evidence, particularly in contract review challenge and risk reviews. IT control deficiencies persist in non-core and international systems, especially around privileged access, segregation of duties, access reviews, and password parameters. Residual IT findings in the Neptune system relate to segregation of duties, with remediation ongoing into FY25. Uncorrected misstatements in the financial close process were observed but are individually and collectively immaterial. The internal control enhancement programme is ongoing and not yet complete. The Audit Committee and external auditors continue to monitor these areas closely, adopting a substantive audit approach due to the control environment risks. | In the prior year, a large number of errors and significant control deficiencies were identified in the internal control environment, reported as a key audit matter. During FY23, the Group designed and implemented the Blueprint Fundamental Control improvements targeting significant financial reporting risk areas including project bid, project management, pensions, taxation, consolidation reporting, and Treasury controls. Despite progress, deficiencies and misstatements, individually and collectively immaterial, remained at year-end. The design of Blueprint Fundamental Controls is more advanced than sector-level controls, with varied implementation and documentation of contract review controls across sectors. Control enhancements during the second half of FY23 meant controls were not operating effectively throughout the year. Improvements in core ERP systems were noted, but issues with privileged access controls and password controls in the IT environment persisted. The internal controls enhancement programme is multi-year and not yet complete. The external auditor did not rely on controls for substantive testing due to these deficiencies, contributing to extended audit effort. |
| Effectiveness | Management and the Board, through the Audit Committee, have assessed the internal control system as substantially improved in FY24, with significant enhancements made to the control environment. The Audit Committee has expressed satisfaction with progress against the internal control roadmap and control enhancements, including the embedding of the Blueprint Fundamental Controls and improvements in contract review and IT general controls. The Board conducts an annual review of risk management and internal controls and concluded that the Group's risk management processes provide effective management of principal, emerging, and underlying risks. The Committee acknowledges that while substantial progress has been made, further work is required to embed and sustain controls, particularly in evidence retention and operational consistency. The internal audit function, now fully insourced, provides effective independent assurance, and the Audit Committee continues to oversee the control enhancement programme. The Group is proactively preparing to meet the 2024 UK Corporate Governance Code requirements, including future declarations on material control effectiveness. Overall, the control environment is viewed as progressively robust, with ongoing enhancements planned to achieve best-in-class standards. | Following its FY23 review, the Audit Committee and the Board were satisfied with the progress made in improving risk management and internal control systems through the Blueprint of Control Improvements. The Committee concluded that the Company has effectively implemented the 15 key controls for Financial Reporting as required by the Blueprint. The Board formally reviews the effectiveness of internal controls at least annually and is satisfied that the risk management process provides effective management of principal, emerging, and underlying risks in adherence to the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness of the internal audit function and monitors the transition from outsourced to insourced internal audit. However, the Board recognizes ongoing scope for further improvement in FY24, including embedding progress and lessons learned from FY23. The Committee continues to oversee the control enhancement programme to ensure progress and embedding within Group processes. The Company is preparing for future corporate governance reforms and expanded disclosure requirements. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Babcock International Group PLC faces several forward-looking economic challenges and uncertainties as outlined in the 2024 annual report. Persistent inflation could lead to prolonged stagflation, impacting industry growth and productivity. Tight labour markets with elevated wage inflation, energy price volatility, constrained global supply, and increased demand contribute to economic uncertainties. Supply chain disruptions due to global constraints, natural disasters, geopolitical tensions (notably conflicts in the Middle East and South China Sea), and industrial action pose risks to timely delivery and cost control. The Group is also exposed to financial risks including foreign currency fluctuations, interest rate changes, liquidity, and credit risks, which could affect funding costs and availability. Government spending decisions, especially from major government-backed customers like the UK MOD, create uncertainties around contract volumes, terms, and profitability, with risks of contract reductions, early terminations, or renegotiations. Inflation impacts contract pricing and costs, with efforts to include cost recovery mechanisms to mitigate this risk. Climate-related risks, including physical risks from extreme weather and transition risks related to policy, technology, and market changes towards a low-carbon economy, may cause financial, commercial, reputational, and operational impacts. Pension scheme liabilities are sensitive to assumptions on inflation, discount rates, life expectancy, and regulatory changes, potentially increasing costs and cash requirements. The Group also faces risks from geopolitical instability affecting market conditions and contract delivery, and challenges in securing contracts in new markets due to market understanding, legal, and licensing issues. Overall, these economic factors create a complex environment of cost pressures, market volatility, and regulatory challenges that could impact Babcock's revenue, profitability, and financial resilience. | Babcock International Group PLC faces several economic challenges including volatile macroeconomic conditions with inflationary pressures that are beginning to recede slowly. Approximately two-thirds of revenue has some inflation protection, but fixed-price contracts retain inflation risk, especially due to rising labour costs which constitute about 50% of the cost base for fixed-price contracts, particularly in the UK. Labour cost increases have led to significant pay deal costs that exceed recoverable contract costs, requiring offset through efficiencies. The Group is exposed to inflation in supplier costs such as products, commodities, energy, freight, and labour rates, which may impact profitability if costs cannot be passed on. Supply chain disruptions, including sole source component availability and geopolitical conflicts like the Ukraine war, pose risks to contract delivery and costs. Government budget constraints and political decisions, especially from major government-backed customers like the UK MOD, can reduce contract opportunities, lead to early terminations, renegotiations, or favor in-house or overseas suppliers, impacting revenue and profitability. Financial resilience risks include potential difficulties in raising debt funding, increased borrowing costs, credit rating downgrades, pension scheme funding pressures, and capital allocation constraints. Climate-related physical and transition risks, such as flooding, extreme heat, carbon pricing, and decarbonization costs, also present economic uncertainties affecting costs and market demand. The post-Brexit labour market disruption has caused skill shortages and labour cost inflation. The Group manages these risks through contract protections, supply chain risk monitoring, and active customer engagement but acknowledges ongoing economic uncertainties that could affect business performance. |
