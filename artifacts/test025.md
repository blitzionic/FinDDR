# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | QinetiQ Group plc's revenue increased steadily from GBP 1,320.4m in 2022 to GBP 1,580.7m in 2023 and reached GBP 1,912.1m in 2024, reflecting strong top-line growth. Gross margin, however, declined sharply from 96.34% in 2022 to 12.51% in 2023 and remained nearly flat at 12.64% in 2024, indicating a significant change in cost structure or reporting. By product/service, EMEA Services revenue grew from GBP 1,059.2m in 2022 to GBP 1,179.3m in 2023 and GBP 1,417.4m in 2024, while Global Solutions increased from GBP 351.3m in 2022 to GBP 401.4m in 2023 and GBP 494.7m in 2024. Regionally, UK revenue fluctuated from GBP 1,045.7m in 2022 to GBP 901.9m in 2023 and rebounded to GBP 1,066.8m in 2024; US revenue rose from GBP 301.0m in 2022 to GBP 153.0m in 2023 and then surged to GBP 401.9m in 2024, while Australia and Rest of World also showed growth in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 9.29% in 2022 to 10.93% in 2023, then slightly decreased to 10.07% in 2024. Operating income rose from GBP 122.7m in 2022 to GBP 172.8m in 2023 and GBP 192.5m in 2024, tracking revenue growth. Operating expenses were GBP (1,149.4)m in 2022, increased to GBP (1,382.9)m in 2023, but dropped sharply to GBP (49.2)m in 2024, suggesting a major change in expense classification or reporting. Despite rising revenues, the company maintained operating efficiency, but the volatility in operating expenses and gross margin points to possible changes in cost allocation or accounting treatment. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from (28.51%) in 2022 to (19.53%) in 2023, then increased to (23.59%) in 2024, impacting net profit, which rose from GBP 90.0m in 2022 to GBP 154.4m in 2023 but fell to GBP 139.6m in 2024 despite higher revenue. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors are listed in the provided data. The fluctuations in effective tax rate directly affected net profit margins, which moved from 6.82% in 2022 to 9.77% in 2023 and then declined to 7.30% in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, QinetiQ Group plc demonstrated a stable financial position with total assets of £2,106.2m, a slight increase from £2,072.1m in 2023. Current assets rose to £789.0m, outpacing the increase in current liabilities to £685.8m, resulting in a current ratio of 115.05% (up from 112.28%), indicating a modest improvement in short-term liquidity. Total liabilities increased to £1,180.1m, primarily due to higher current liabilities, while non-current liabilities decreased to £454.3m. Shareholders' equity declined to £926.1m from £968.3m, and retained earnings also fell to £742.3m, reflecting the impact of dividend payments and lower net profit. The debt to equity ratio increased to 127.43% (from 113.99%), signaling a higher reliance on debt financing and a more leveraged capital structure. Overall, the company maintains adequate liquidity but faces a weakening equity base and rising leverage. | In 2023, QinetiQ Group plc's total assets increased to £2,072.1m from £1,768.7m in 2022, reflecting asset growth primarily in non-current assets (£1,389.8m in 2023 vs £1,090.5m in 2022). However, total liabilities rose significantly to £1,103.8m (from £727.3m), with both current and non-current liabilities increasing. Shareholders' equity declined to £968.3m (from £1,041.4m), and retained earnings also decreased to £772.0m. The current ratio fell to 112.28% (from 133.35%), indicating reduced short-term liquidity, though it remains above 100%. The debt to equity ratio rose sharply to 113.99% (from 69.84%), signaling a more leveraged capital structure. Overall, while the company expanded its asset base, it did so with increased leverage and a reduction in equity, which may impact financial flexibility. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 showed mixed results. Revenue grew significantly to £1,912.1m (up from £1,580.7m), and gross profit increased to £241.7m. Gross margin remained stable at 12.64% (2023: 12.51%), indicating consistent cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income rose to £192.5m, but the operating margin declined to 10.07% (from 10.93%), suggesting higher operating expenses relative to revenue. Net profit decreased to £139.6m (from £154.4m), and net profit margin fell to 7.30% (from 9.77%), reflecting increased interest and tax expenses. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) both declined to 14.74% and 6.68%, respectively, indicating reduced efficiency in generating returns for shareholders and from assets. The effective tax rate increased to 23.59% (from 19.53%), further pressuring net earnings. Overall, while top-line growth was strong, bottom-line profitability and returns weakened. | QinetiQ's revenue grew to £1,580.7m in 2023 (from £1,320.4m), and net profit increased to £154.4m (from £90.0m), indicating improved bottom-line performance. However, gross profit dropped sharply to £197.8m (from £1,272.1m), and gross margin fell to 12.51% (from 96.34%), suggesting a significant increase in cost of goods sold. Despite this, operating income rose to £172.8m and operating margin improved to 10.93% (from 9.29%), reflecting better control over operating expenses. Net profit margin also improved to 9.77% (from 6.82%). Return on equity (15.37%) and return on assets (8.04%) in 2023 indicate solid profitability relative to capital employed. The effective tax rate decreased to 19.53% (from 28.51%), supporting net profit growth. Overall, while revenue and net profit improved, the sharp decline in gross margin warrants attention regarding earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in some areas in 2024. Asset turnover increased to 91.53% (from 82.31%), indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations rose to £243.1m (from £206.0m), reflecting stronger cash generation from core activities. Inventories increased to £89.2m, which may indicate higher working capital requirements or preparation for future demand. Operating expenses were reported at £49.2m, a significant reduction from the prior year, but this may reflect a reclassification or reporting change, as cost of goods sold and operating expenses together exceed revenue. Net cash from investing was an outflow of £99.1m, much lower than the prior year's £464.4m, suggesting reduced capital expenditure or acquisition activity. Net cash from financing was an outflow of £63.2m, compared to an inflow in 2023, likely due to higher dividend payments (£45.6m) and possible debt repayments. The net increase in cash was £80.8m, a reversal from the prior year's decrease, indicating improved cash flow management. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed signals. Asset turnover was 82.31%, indicating moderate utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased to £206.0m (from £188.7m), reflecting strong cash generation. However, net cash from investing was a significant outflow at £(464.4)m (vs £(81.6)m), suggesting substantial investment activity. Net cash from financing turned positive at £159.7m (from £(59.4)m), likely due to increased borrowing, as seen in higher liabilities. The net decrease in cash was £(98.7)m, indicating that investment outflows exceeded operational inflows. Inventories increased to £68.8m (from £54.9m), which may tie up working capital. Despite higher operating cash flow, the large investment outflow and increased leverage suggest operational efficiency is being supported by external financing. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Key financial risks in 2024 include increased leverage, as evidenced by the higher debt to equity ratio of 127.43%. The interest coverage ratio declined to 929.95% (from 1289.55%), though it remains robust, indicating the company can comfortably meet interest obligations. The current ratio improved slightly, but remains close to 1, suggesting only moderate liquidity. The effective tax rate rose to 23.59%, increasing the tax burden and reducing net profit. The decline in shareholders' equity and retained earnings, combined with higher dividend payouts, may constrain future financial flexibility. The reduction in non-current liabilities partially offsets the risk from higher current liabilities. No data is available on contingent liabilities or off-balance sheet risks. Overall, while liquidity and interest coverage are adequate, rising leverage and declining equity warrant close monitoring. | Financial risk increased in 2023. The debt to equity ratio rose to 113.99%, indicating higher leverage and greater reliance on debt financing. The current ratio declined to 112.28%, reflecting reduced liquidity, though it remains above 100%. Interest expense increased to £13.4m (from £1.9m), but interest coverage, while lower at 1,289.55% (from 6,457.89%), remains robust. The effective tax rate decreased to 19.53%, which is favorable for net income but may not be sustainable. The significant increase in both current and non-current liabilities, coupled with a decrease in equity, heightens financial risk. The net cash outflow and increased dividend payments (£42.6m) further pressure liquidity. Overall, the company faces higher leverage and liquidity risks, though interest coverage remains strong. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, QinetiQ's strong revenue growth, particularly in the United States (revenue up from £153.0m to £401.9m) and EMEA Services (up from £1,179.3m to £1,417.4m), suggests positive momentum in key markets and segments. The significant reduction in investing outflows in 2024 may indicate a pause in major capital projects or acquisitions, potentially limiting future growth unless new investments are made. Cash flow from operations remains strong and supports ongoing dividend payments, but the declining equity base and higher leverage could limit future dividend increases or require more conservative financial policies. The improved asset turnover and cash position provide a buffer, but sustained profitability will depend on managing rising costs, interest, and tax expenses. Geographic diversification, especially the growth in the US and Australia, may provide resilience, but continued monitoring of margin pressures and capital structure is advised for future stability. | QinetiQ's substantial investment outflow in 2023 (£464.4m) suggests a focus on growth or expansion, which could support future revenue and profit growth if investments are successful. However, the net decrease in cash and increased reliance on financing raise questions about cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments increased slightly to £42.6m, indicating a continued commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue growth was driven by both EMEA Services (£1,179.3m) and Global Solutions (£401.4m), with both segments increasing year-on-year. Geographically, revenue from the UK declined to £901.9m (from £1,045.7m), while other regions remained relatively stable or decreased. The shift in revenue mix and heavy investment may signal a strategic pivot or expansion outside the UK. Future performance will depend on the returns generated from recent investments and the company's ability to manage higher leverage and maintain cash flow. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | QinetiQ faces market risks including loss of market share due to changes in the market landscape, business agility, defence spending fluctuations, and competition from new entrants with aggressive risk appetites. The company mitigates these risks by enhancing its competitive position through a customer-centric approach to digital transformation, augmenting its diverse product portfolio, and aligning skills and resources to customer needs in home and priority markets. This approach aims to mitigate contract risk, optimize project delivery, and ensure efficiency and customer satisfaction throughout capture and project delivery. | QinetiQ operates in highly competitive and complex defence and security markets influenced by geopolitical instability, including the conflict in Ukraine and rising global tensions. The Group faces risks from demand volatility driven by government defence budget priorities and evolving strategic defence capabilities in the UK, US, and Australia. Large UK government contracts, which contribute materially to revenue, are subject to renewal risk over the next five years. Macroeconomic volatility, including inflation and cost of living pressures, impacts customer spending and supply chain stability. The Group also faces risks from emerging technologies disrupting traditional defence markets and the need to innovate rapidly to maintain competitive advantage. Mitigation includes investment in contract capabilities, maintaining strong customer relationships, innovation focus, and leveraging global market opportunities aligned with the AUKUS alliance. The Group monitors market trends and competitor activity as part of its strategic planning and risk management. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks identified include climate change impacts (physical and transition risks), organisational culture, cyber security, management of change, health, safety and wellbeing, information security, IT infrastructure, licence to operate, P3M capability, and strategic capability planning. Climate change risks could cause operational disruption, loss of business, reduced investor confidence, and reputational damage. Mitigation includes a Net-Zero plan targeting emissions reduction by 2050 or sooner, energy efficiency investments, Scope 3 emissions reduction programs, governance embedding, and collaboration with customers on sustainable solutions. Business continuity and crisis management procedures are scalable and flexible, supported by a Crisis Management Plan and leadership training. Cyber security and information security risks are managed under CIO and CESO oversight. Licence to operate risks are managed by legal and risk officers. Organisational culture and capability risks are overseen by respective directors. The Group uses a robust risk management framework with assigned risk owners and quarterly reviews. | Operational risks include compliance with an increasingly complex and rising regulatory landscape across multiple jurisdictions, where non-compliance can lead to severe penalties, reputational damage, and business disruption. QinetiQ operates in a dynamic global security threat environment with risks to physical, personnel, information, and cyber security, which could result in loss of sensitive data, harm to employees, and exclusion from government contracts.
