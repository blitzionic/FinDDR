# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Select Harvests Limited's revenue increased from AUD 235,516 thousand in 2022 to AUD 205,987 thousand in 2023, then surged to AUD 337,285 thousand in 2024. Gross profit followed a similar trend, moving from a loss of (1,648) thousand in 2022 to a larger loss of (26,440) thousand in 2023, before recovering to a positive AUD 6,261 thousand in 2024. Gross margin improved from (0.70%) in 2022 to (12.84%) in 2023, then rebounded to 1.86% in 2024. Revenue by product/service in 2024 was dominated by sale of goods and services at AUD 334,664 thousand, with management services and government grants contributing AUD 2,174 thousand and AUD 447 thousand, respectively. In 2022, revenue was predominantly within Australia, but no regional breakdown is available for 2023 and 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin was nearly flat at 0.01% in 2022, dropped sharply to (72.49%) in 2023, and recovered to 4.82% in 2024. Operating income moved from AUD 21,355 thousand in 2022 to a significant loss of (149,314) thousand in 2023, then returned to a positive AUD 16,257 thousand in 2024. Operating expenses remained relatively stable, at AUD (19,707) thousand in 2022, AUD (18,364) thousand in 2023, and AUD (18,157) thousand in 2024, indicating effective cost containment despite revenue volatility. The improvement in operating margin and income in 2024 reflects a turnaround in operational efficiency. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted from 21.85% in 2022 to (28.08%) in 2023, then to 17.65% in 2024, indicating significant volatility that likely impacted net profitability, especially in 2023 when the company reported a large net loss. Income tax expense was negative in 2022 at (1,726) thousand, surged to 44,799 thousand in 2023, and normalized to 225 thousand in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors are listed in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Select Harvests Limited demonstrated a stronger financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased to AUD 1,010,068 thousand from AUD 913,250 thousand, driven primarily by a significant rise in current assets (AUD 315,222 thousand vs. AUD 204,518 thousand), while non-current assets slightly decreased. Total liabilities also rose to AUD 529,309 thousand (from AUD 501,725 thousand), but the increase in equity outpaced this, with shareholders' equity growing to AUD 480,759 thousand (from AUD 411,525 thousand). The current ratio remained robust at 176.36%, indicating strong short-term liquidity, though it slightly declined from 184.70% in 2023. The debt to equity ratio improved to 110.10% from 121.92%, reflecting a more balanced capital structure. Retained earnings increased modestly, and inventories rose, supporting higher operational activity. Overall, the company’s balance sheet in 2024 reflects improved capitalization, liquidity, and a healthier capital structure. | In 2023, Select Harvests Limited experienced a decline in overall financial health. Total assets decreased to AUD 913,250k from AUD 1,014,284k in 2022, reflecting a contraction in both current and non-current assets. Current assets fell to AUD 204,518k (from AUD 261,935k), and inventories dropped significantly to AUD 85,317k (from AUD 141,056k), indicating reduced working capital. Total liabilities increased to AUD 501,725k (from AUD 494,000k), driven by higher non-current liabilities. Shareholders' equity declined sharply to AUD 411,525k (from AUD 520,284k), and retained earnings eroded to AUD 3,829k (from AUD 117,091k), highlighting substantial losses. The current ratio decreased to 184.70% (from 237.38%), still above 100% but indicating reduced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio rose to 121.92% (from 94.95%), signaling a more leveraged capital structure and increased reliance on debt financing. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability rebounded sharply in 2024. Revenue surged to AUD 337,285 thousand (up from AUD 205,987 thousand), and gross profit turned positive at AUD 6,261 thousand after a loss in 2023. All key margins improved: gross margin rose to 1.86% (from -12.84%), operating margin to 4.82% (from -72.49%), and net profit margin to 0.44% (from -55.70%). Net profit was AUD 1,500 thousand, a significant turnaround from the prior year’s loss. Return on equity and return on assets both turned positive, albeit modestly (ROE: 0.34%, ROA: 0.16%), indicating restored, though still low, profitability. The effective tax rate normalized to 17.65%. Overall, 2024 marks a return to profitability with improved earnings quality, though margins remain thin and returns are still low. | Profitability deteriorated markedly in 2023. Revenue declined to AUD 205,987k (from AUD 235,516k), while cost of goods sold remained high at AUD 232,427k, resulting in a negative gross profit of AUD (26,440)k. Gross margin worsened to (12.84%) from (0.70%), and operating margin was highly negative at (72.49%). Net profit remained deeply negative at AUD (114,727)k, with net profit margin deteriorating to (55.70%) from (48.71%). Return on equity was negative at (24.62%) and return on assets at (11.90%), both indicating significant value erosion. The effective tax rate increased in absolute terms to (28.08%) from (21.85%), further impacting net results. Overall, earnings quality was poor, with persistent losses and negative margins across all levels. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024. Asset turnover increased to 35.07% (from 21.37%), reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Cost control was evident as operating expenses remained stable (AUD 18,157 thousand vs. AUD 18,364 thousand) despite the large revenue increase. Net cash from operations rose substantially to AUD 21,349 thousand (from AUD 3,306 thousand), indicating improved working capital management and cash generation. Inventories increased to AUD 124,992 thousand, supporting higher sales activity. Net cash used in investing decreased, and net cash from financing was lower, suggesting less reliance on external funding. The company achieved a positive net increase in cash (AUD 8,058 thousand), reversing the prior year’s outflow. These trends point to enhanced operational efficiency and cash flow management in 2024. | Operational efficiency weakened in 2023. Cost control was insufficient, as cost of goods sold remained high relative to declining revenue, leading to a larger negative gross profit. Asset turnover was reported at 21.37%, but with declining asset and revenue bases, this may reflect asset disposals or write-downs rather than improved utilization. Net cash from operations dropped sharply to AUD 3,306k (from AUD 26,843k), indicating weaker cash generation from core activities. Working capital contracted, as seen in lower current assets and inventories. Net cash from investing was negative at AUD (26,151)k, suggesting continued investment outflows, while net cash from financing increased to AUD 19,185k, likely to support liquidity. The net decrease in cash of AUD (3,660)k (versus an increase in 2022) further signals operational and cash flow challenges. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators improved in 2024 but warrant continued monitoring. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 110.10%, reducing leverage risk, and the current ratio remained strong at 176.36%, supporting liquidity. Interest expense increased to AUD 14,982 thousand, but interest coverage improved to 108.51% (from -1462.14%), indicating restored ability to service debt. The effective tax rate normalized to 17.65% from a negative rate, reducing tax-related volatility. However, the company’s margins and returns remain low, and the increase in current liabilities (AUD 178,741 thousand vs. AUD 110,727 thousand) could pressure liquidity if not managed. No dividend was paid in 2024, possibly reflecting a cautious approach to cash preservation. Overall, while financial risks have moderated, thin profitability and increased current liabilities are early warning signals to monitor. | Financial risk increased in 2023. The debt to equity ratio rose to 121.92%, indicating higher leverage and greater financial risk. The current ratio, while still above 1, declined to 184.70%, reflecting reduced liquidity. Interest expense more than doubled to AUD (10,212)k, but the reported interest coverage ratio of 1462.14% appears inconsistent with negative operating income, suggesting possible data anomalies or non-cash adjustments. The effective tax rate increased to (28.08%), and the company continued to post large net losses, eroding equity and retained earnings. These factors, combined with negative cash flows from operations and increased reliance on financing, point to heightened risk of financial distress if trends persist. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Select Harvests Limited’s improved cash flow from operations and reduced reliance on financing in 2024 suggest a more sustainable financial footing. The reduction in net cash used for investing (AUD -18,385 thousand vs. AUD -26,151 thousand) may indicate a pause or completion of major investment cycles, potentially freeing up cash for future growth or dividends. The absence of a dividend in 2024 could signal a focus on strengthening the balance sheet or funding future investments. Revenue growth was driven almost entirely by the sale of goods and services, with minimal change in other revenue streams, and no geographic breakdown is available. If operational improvements and cost controls persist, and if the company can further improve margins, future profitability and cash flow sustainability should strengthen. However, continued attention to working capital and margin expansion will be critical for long-term performance. | Looking ahead, Select Harvests Limited faces significant challenges to restoring financial stability. Investment outflows remained substantial at AUD (26,151)k, indicating ongoing capital commitments despite weak operating cash flows. Dividend payments were reduced to AUD (2,419)k (from AUD 9,624k), suggesting a more conservative dividend policy in response to losses. The sustainability of cash flows is questionable given the sharp drop in operating cash generation and increased financing inflows. With revenue concentrated in the sale of goods and services (AUD 203,386k) and no clear geographic diversification data for 2023, future performance will depend on the company's ability to improve cost control, restore profitability, and manage leverage. Without a turnaround in core operations and cash flow, financial risks may persist or intensify. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Select Harvests operates as a fully integrated almond company, primarily generating revenue through the growing, processing, value-adding, and sale of almonds and almond products. The company owns and leases over 9,165 hectares of almond orchards in Australia (Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales), and also processes almonds from independent growers. Its state-of-the-art Carina West processing facility has a capacity exceeding 40,000MT, enabling the company to process both its own and third-party almonds. Revenue streams include: (1) sale of raw and value-added almond products (such as blanched, roasted, sliced, diced, meal, and paste) to over 600 customers globally across multiple categories (beverage, bakery, confectionery, cereal, snacking, health, dairy, re-packers, and wholesalers); (2) management services for farm management and development, as well as sub-leasing of non-almond orchards; and (3) processing services for external growers. In FY2024, revenue from the sale of goods and services was $334.7 million, with $45.8 million from value-added products and $288.9 million from non value-added products. The company also generates revenue from management services ($2.2 million in FY2024) and occasional government grants or other income. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. Select Harvests is increasingly focused on mid-stream operations (processing and value-adding), which supports more consistent earnings and reduces agricultural risk. The company also undertakes project management initiatives to drive operational efficiency and margin improvement. | Select Harvests operates as a fully integrated almond company, generating revenue primarily through the growing, processing, value-adding, and sale of almonds and almond products. The company owns and leases almond orchards, processes both its own and external growers' almonds, and sells raw and value-added almond products (such as blanched, roasted, sliced, diced, meal, and paste) to over 600 customers globally across multiple categories including beverage, bakery, confectionery, cereal, snacking, health, dairy, re-packers, and wholesalers. Revenue streams include the sale of goods (almonds and value-added almond products), management services (management and development of farms, sub-leasing of non-almond orchards), and agency services for shipping and insurance. In FY2023, revenue from the sale of goods and services was $203.4 million, with $44.2 million from value-added products and $159.2 million from non value-added products. The company also generates revenue from processing external grower volumes and is developing a circular economy model by commercializing by-products (hull and shell) for compost, energy, and cattle feedlots. The majority of sales are export-oriented and transacted in US dollars. |
| Market Position | Select Harvests is one of the world's largest fully integrated almond companies and is the second largest almond producer in Australia. The company processed a record 40,047MT of product in FY2024, with a crop volume of 29,527MT (49% higher than 2023) and a fivefold increase in external grower volumes to 10,520MT. Contracted sales volume in 2024 was 36,624MT, a 19% increase on the prior year and well above the three-year average of 27,793MT. Select Harvests is a market leader in the Australian almond industry, with a strong presence in both domestic and global markets. The company has leveraged tariff advantages to increase sales to key export markets such as China (sales to China increased by nearly 30% in 2024) and India, and has increased direct supply to manufacturers and retailers by 14%, reducing broker fees and improving margins. Its competitive advantages include a geographically diverse orchard portfolio, world-class processing facilities, a broad range of value-added products, and a focus on operational efficiency and sustainability. While specific global market share percentages are not provided, Select Harvests' scale, processing capacity, and export reach position it as a leading player and a market leader in Australia, with significant influence in key international markets. | Select Harvests is one of the world's largest almond growers and the second largest almond producer in Australia. The company is a market leader in the Australian almond industry, with a geographically diverse orchard portfolio and a state-of-the-art processing facility. Despite being a major player globally, Select Harvests is smaller in volume compared to the US (California) almond industry, which sets global pricing. In FY2023, Select Harvests' crop was 19,771 MT, representing a 30.2% decrease from the previous year due to adverse weather, and the company faced challenges with lower crop quality and global almond prices at historic lows. The company supplies premium value-added almond products under the Renshaw and Allinga Farms brands and is recognized for its leadership in processing scale and efficiency. While specific global or domestic market share percentages are not provided, Select Harvests is described as a leader in the supply of 'better for you' and 'better for the planet' plant-based foods and is well placed to benefit from global demand growth for almonds. The company’s competitive advantages include vertical integration, processing technology, a diversified customer base, and a focus on sustainability. However, in FY2023, Select Harvests' financial performance was significantly impacted by lower crop volumes and prices, resulting in a net operating loss after tax of $114.7 million. The company is positioned as a market leader in Australia and a significant global player, but not the largest globally. |


# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Company faces market risks including foreign currency fluctuations due to the global almond price being transacted in US dollars, which can negatively impact profitability through USD/AUD exchange rate movements. Almond price decreases driven by US supply and global demand levels also pose a risk to earnings. The Company monitors geopolitical tensions, global inflation impacting key supply inputs like fertiliser, and industry trends such as US almond acreage and global consumption patterns. Mitigation includes maintaining contact with key US industry bodies and major traders, developing crop sales plans considering pricing factors, extensive global marketing, and monitoring consumer demand drivers. The Company also manages foreign exchange risk through Treasury and Risk Management policies, hedging instruments, and a Treasury Committee oversight. Broader disruption events such as pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, and supply chain disruptions are risks, mitigated by maintaining a diverse supplier base and varied sales channels. The Company also monitors global almond market outlook and pricing trends to inform strategy. | The Company faces market risks primarily from foreign currency fluctuations, almond price decreases, and global market conditions. Foreign exchange risk arises due to sales and purchases denominated in US dollars and Euros, with profitability impacted by USD/AUD exchange rate movements. The global almond price is determined by the US market, and lower almond prices negatively affect earnings. Demand volatility is noted with subdued global almond prices and lower demand in key markets such as the US. The Company monitors global inflation impacts on key supply inputs like fertiliser. Mitigation includes a Treasury and Risk Management policy with active hedging strategies (FECs and options) and a Treasury Committee that monitors exposures monthly. The Company maintains contact with key industry bodies and customers to monitor pricing and demand trends and develops crop sales plans accordingly. The Company also monitors global food consumption trends and industry supply and demand factors. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and global inflation are continuously monitored. The Company’s diversification of assets across Australia helps mitigate climate-related market risks.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Select Harvests faces economic challenges primarily from global inflation driven by geopolitical tensions, impacting key supply inputs such as fertiliser. Water supply and cost remain significant uncertainties due to drought, government water buyback strategies, and fluctuating water prices, which could increase operational costs and affect profitability. The company manages foreign currency risk as most sales are in US dollars, exposing profitability to USD/AUD exchange rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk is present due to variable rate borrowings amid a high interest rate environment. Climate-related risks including weather volatility, droughts, floods, and transitioning to a low-carbon economy may impact crop quality, water security, operational costs, and compliance with environmental regulations. The company also faces risks from broader disruption events such as global pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, and supply chain disruptions. Cost pressures include increased investment in fertiliser, water, bees, and farm leasing costs, partially offset by labour efficiencies and processing cost reductions. The company forecasts slight increases in water costs and total production costs for FY2025. Market conditions include sensitivity to almond prices influenced by US supply and global demand, with the 2024/25 US crop forecast lower and carryover stocks reduced, supporting price increases. The company continuously monitors these economic factors and employs mitigation strategies such as diversified water portfolios, treasury risk management policies, and strategic pricing and supply planning. | Select Harvests faced significant economic challenges in FY2023 including the impact of a third consecutive La Nina weather pattern causing cooler and wetter conditions that materially reduced crop volume and quality, leading to a 30.2% decrease in almond crop volume and a 34% lower crop than forecast. Global almond prices remained subdued and well below historical averages, with the US market continuing to lower carryout inventory and increased lower grade crop supply weighing down prices. Inflationary pressures increased input costs such as fertiliser and chemicals due to geopolitical tensions (notably the Russia-Ukraine conflict), higher labour costs, and increased orchard lease costs. Water supply and pricing volatility due to drought and floods also posed risks to profitability. The Company experienced a large financial operating loss driven by lower volumes, lower quality, and low pricing, resulting in increased debt levels and negative operating cash flows. Foreign currency fluctuations, particularly USD/AUD exchange rates, and interest rate risks on variable rate borrowings further contributed to economic uncertainties. The Company is managing these risks through cost control, cash flow initiatives, hedging strategies, and operational efficiency improvements. The outlook for FY2024 assumes improved crop volume and quality, higher almond prices, and drier, hotter conditions beneficial to almond growing, but economic uncertainties remain tied to weather, global market conditions, and input cost inflation. |
