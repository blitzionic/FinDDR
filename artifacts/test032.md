# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | NEXTDC Limited's revenue increased steadily from AUD 291,044 thousand in 2022 to AUD 362,369 thousand in 2023, and further to AUD 404,337 thousand in 2024, representing a 39% growth over the three-year period. However, gross margin declined from 85.05% in 2022 to 77.10% in 2023 and further to 76.15% in 2024, indicating rising direct costs relative to revenue. By product/service, colocation revenue grew from AUD 263,070 thousand in 2023 to AUD 285,826 thousand in 2024, while interconnection revenue increased from AUD 25,309 thousand to AUD 28,276 thousand. Other revenue, including power passthrough, also rose from AUD 68,800 thousand in 2023 to AUD 86,587 thousand in 2024. Geographically, NSW/ACT remained the largest contributor, growing from AUD 135,614 thousand in 2022 to AUD 203,689 thousand in 2024, while Victoria increased from AUD 101,870 thousand to AUD 129,354 thousand over the same period. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved significantly from 0.02% in 2022 to 29.18% in 2023, before declining to 26.76% in 2024. Operating income rose from AUD 53,725 thousand in 2022 to AUD 105,755 thousand in 2023 and AUD 108,203 thousand in 2024, while revenue increased at a similar pace, suggesting improved but plateauing operating leverage. Operating expenses decreased sharply from AUD 193,799 thousand in 2022 to AUD 91,497 thousand in 2023, then rose to AUD 109,696 thousand in 2024, indicating some cost discipline in 2023 followed by renewed expense growth in 2024. The company’s ability to maintain operating income growth despite rising costs in 2024 suggests some resilience, but the declining operating margin signals pressure on efficiency. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate was highly volatile, at 651.21% in 2022, (12.24%) in 2023, and (21.59%) in 2024, with the negative rates in 2023 and 2024 indicating tax benefits or deferred tax assets impacting net profit. Income tax expense shifted from a benefit of AUD (10,797) thousand in 2022 to expenses of AUD 2,402 thousand in 2023 and AUD 7,840 thousand in 2024. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, NEXTDC Limited demonstrated a significant strengthening of its balance sheet. Total assets increased markedly to AUD 5,216,697,000 (from AUD 3,903,059,000 in 2023), driven by both current assets (up to AUD 1,334,714,000) and non-current assets (up to AUD 3,881,983,000). Total liabilities rose modestly to AUD 1,649,597,000 (from AUD 1,573,381,000), with current liabilities at AUD 150,592,000 and non-current liabilities at AUD 1,499,005,000. Shareholders' equity saw a substantial increase to AUD 3,567,100,000 (from AUD 2,329,678,000), reflecting strong capital inflows and retained losses. The current ratio remains extremely high at 886.31%, indicating robust short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved to 46.24% (from 67.54%), suggesting a more conservative capital structure with lower relative leverage. However, retained earnings remain negative at AUD (114,587,000), indicating accumulated losses. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2024 is characterized by a strong asset base, high liquidity, and a lower reliance on debt, but persistent negative retained earnings warrant attention. | In 2023, NEXTDC Limited demonstrated a robust balance sheet expansion, with total assets rising to AUD 3,903,059 thousand from AUD 3,026,452 thousand in 2022. Current assets increased significantly to AUD 853,254 thousand, while current liabilities decreased to AUD 91,766 thousand, resulting in a very strong current ratio of 929.81% (up from 505.79% in 2022), indicating exceptional short-term liquidity. Total liabilities increased to AUD 1,573,381 thousand, but shareholders' equity also grew substantially to AUD 2,329,678 thousand, improving the debt to equity ratio to 67.54% from 73.14%. Retained earnings remained negative at (70,441) thousand, reflecting accumulated losses. The capital structure is equity-heavy, with a moderate and improving leverage profile. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 is characterized by strong liquidity, increased asset base, and a healthier capital structure, though negative retained earnings warrant attention. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 showed mixed results. Revenue increased to AUD 404,337,000 (up from AUD 362,369,000), and gross profit rose to AUD 307,899,000. However, gross margin slightly declined to 76.15% (from 77.10%), and operating margin decreased to 26.76% (from 29.18%), reflecting rising costs. Net profit remained negative at AUD (44,146,000), a deterioration from AUD (22,032,000) in 2023, with net profit margin worsening to (10.92%) from (6.08%). Return on equity and return on assets both remained negative, at (1.50%) and (0.97%) respectively, indicating continued challenges in generating returns for shareholders and on assets. Interest expense increased to AUD 91,967,000, further pressuring net results. The effective tax rate shifted to (21.59%), up from (12.24%), reflecting higher tax expenses despite pre-tax losses. Overall, while top-line growth is evident, earnings quality is impacted by higher costs, increased interest expense, and persistent net losses. | Profitability in 2023 showed mixed signals. Revenue grew strongly by 24.5% to AUD 362,369 thousand. However, gross margin declined to 77.10% from 85.05%, indicating higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating margin improved sharply to 29.18% from 0.02%, reflecting much better cost control at the operating expense level (operating expenses fell to AUD 91,497 thousand from AUD 193,799 thousand). Despite these improvements, the company reported a net loss of (22,032) thousand, reversing a net profit of 9,139 thousand in 2022, and net profit margin fell to (6.08%). Return on equity and assets were both negative at (1.08%) and (0.64%) respectively, indicating unprofitable use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate turned negative at (12.24%), and interest expense increased to AUD 73,119 thousand. Overall, while top-line growth and operating efficiency improved, high interest costs and other below-the-line items led to a net loss, raising concerns about earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 was challenged by rising costs and declining asset utilization. Cost of goods sold increased to AUD 96,438,000 (from AUD 82,998,000), and operating expenses rose to AUD 109,696,000 (from AUD 91,497,000), outpacing revenue growth. Asset turnover declined to 8.87% (from 10.46%), indicating less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations was stable at AUD 128,790,000 (vs. AUD 126,472,000 in 2023), suggesting consistent cash generation from core activities. However, net cash used in investing activities increased significantly to AUD (950,910,000), reflecting heavy capital expenditure. Net cash from financing surged to AUD 1,293,776,000, supporting the investment program. The net increase in cash was AUD 471,656,000, indicating strong liquidity inflows. Working capital remains robust, as evidenced by the high current ratio. However, the decline in asset turnover and rising costs signal efficiency pressures. | Operational efficiency improved in several areas in 2023. Asset turnover was 10.46%, indicating effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased to AUD 126,472 thousand, up from AUD 117,176 thousand, showing stronger cash generation from core activities. Operating expenses were sharply reduced, supporting the higher operating margin. However, net cash used in investing activities increased to (695,717) thousand, reflecting significant capital expenditure, while net cash from financing rose to AUD 604,778 thousand, likely to support investment and operations. The net increase in cash was positive at AUD 35,533 thousand, reversing a cash outflow in 2022. Working capital improved, as evidenced by the higher current ratio. Overall, the company demonstrated improved cost control and cash flow from operations, but heavy investment activity continues to consume significant cash. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Key financial risks in 2024 include persistent negative net profit and retained earnings, which may impact long-term sustainability. Leverage risk has moderated, as shown by the improved debt to equity ratio (46.24%), but interest expense increased to AUD 91,967,000, and interest coverage declined to 117.65% (from 144.63%), indicating reduced ability to service debt from operating income. Liquidity risk appears low given the very high current ratio (886.31%), but this may also reflect a large cash position from financing rather than operational strength. The effective tax rate increased to (21.59%), suggesting higher tax outflows despite losses, which could further pressure net results. The decline in asset turnover and operating margin, along with increased capital intensity, are early warning signs of potential operational and financial strain if not offset by future profitability improvements. | Financial risk in 2023 was mitigated by improved liquidity and a lower debt to equity ratio. The current ratio of 929.81% indicates minimal short-term liquidity risk. The debt to equity ratio improved to 67.54%, suggesting a more conservative leverage position. However, interest expense increased to AUD 73,119 thousand, and the company reported a net loss, which could pressure future debt servicing. Interest coverage improved dramatically to 144.63% from 0.11%, but this may be due to non-recurring or non-cash items, given the net loss. The negative effective tax rate and negative retained earnings are early warning signs of underlying profitability challenges. No dividend payments were reported, preserving cash. Overall, while liquidity and leverage metrics are strong, persistent net losses and high interest costs are key risks to monitor. |
| Future financial performance projection | NEXTDC Limited’s substantial investment activity in 2024, with net cash used in investing at AUD (950,910,000), signals a focus on growth and capacity expansion. This is supported by significant financing inflows (AUD 1,293,776,000), which have bolstered cash reserves. The sustainability of cash flow will depend on the company’s ability to translate these investments into profitable growth, as current operations are not yet generating positive net income. No dividends were paid, indicating a retention of cash for reinvestment. Revenue growth was broad-based across products and geographies, with colocation and interconnection revenues increasing, and all major regions (Vic, NSW/ACT, Rest of Australia) showing higher sales. However, the continued net losses and negative retained earnings highlight the need for improved profitability to support future performance. If operational efficiency and margins can be restored, the company is well-positioned for future growth given its expanded asset base and strong liquidity. | NEXTDC Limited’s significant investment outflows in 2023 (AUD 695,717 thousand) and increased financing inflows (AUD 604,778 thousand) suggest ongoing expansion and growth initiatives, likely in data centre infrastructure. The positive net cash position at year-end supports short-term sustainability, but continued net losses and negative retained earnings may constrain future dividend policy and require ongoing external funding. Revenue growth was broad-based across all major regions, with NSW/ACT and Victoria leading, and a small but new international revenue contribution. The company’s focus on colocation and interconnection services, as well as increased power passthrough, indicates diversification of revenue streams. Future performance will depend on the successful monetization of recent investments, continued revenue growth, and the ability to control interest and other below-the-line costs to return to profitability. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
