# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Spark New Zealand Limited's revenue increased from NZD 3,720 million in 2022 to NZD 4,491 million in 2023, before declining to NZD 3,861 million in 2024. Gross margin decreased from 59.88% in 2023 to 54.70% in 2024, indicating rising direct costs relative to revenue. By product/service, Mobile revenue grew from NZD 1,351 million in 2022 to NZD 1,470 million in 2023 and NZD 1,474 million in 2024, showing stability. Procurement and partners revenue increased from NZD 538 million in 2022 to NZD 584 million in 2023, then declined to NZD 548 million in 2024. Broadband revenue decreased from NZD 639 million in 2022 to NZD 626 million in 2023 and further to NZD 613 million in 2024. Revenue by geographic region is not available for any year. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 35.76% in 2023 to 27.53% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating efficiency. Operating income dropped from NZD 1,606 million in 2023 to NZD 1,063 million in 2024, while revenue also fell from NZD 4,491 million to NZD 3,861 million over the same period. Operating expenses remained relatively stable at NZD 967 million in 2023 and NZD 949 million in 2024, but were significantly higher at NZD 2,570 million in 2022, suggesting a major cost reduction initiative between 2022 and 2023. Despite stable operating expenses, the sharp decline in operating income and margin in 2024 points to pressure on profitability from either lower revenue or higher direct costs. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased sharply from (1.48%) in 2023 to (38.52%) in 2024, after being (29.43%) in 2022, significantly impacting net profit, which fell from NZD 1,135 million in 2023 to NZD 316 million in 2024. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Spark New Zealand Limited's total assets increased to NZD 4,635 million from NZD 4,482 million in 2023, indicating modest asset growth. However, total liabilities rose significantly to NZD 3,045 million (from NZD 2,542 million), outpacing asset growth and resulting in a notable decline in shareholders' equity to NZD 1,590 million (from NZD 1,940 million). The current ratio fell sharply to 100.94% from 126.94%, signaling a much tighter liquidity position and reduced short-term financial flexibility. The debt to equity ratio increased substantially to 191.51% (from 131.03%), reflecting a more leveraged capital structure and higher reliance on debt financing. Retained earnings also declined to NZD 1,194 million (from NZD 1,371 million), further weakening the equity base. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2024 is characterized by increased leverage, reduced liquidity, and a shrinking equity cushion. | In 2023, Spark New Zealand Limited demonstrated a strengthened financial position. Total assets increased to NZD 4,482 million from NZD 4,189 million in 2022, driven by a rise in non-current assets (NZD 3,403 million vs. NZD 2,968 million). Total liabilities decreased to NZD 2,542 million from NZD 2,714 million, with both current and non-current liabilities declining. Shareholders' equity rose significantly to NZD 1,940 million (from NZD 1,475 million), reflecting robust retained earnings growth (NZD 1,371 million vs. NZD 722 million). The current ratio remained healthy at 126.94%, only slightly lower than 2022, indicating stable short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved markedly to 131.03% from 184.00%, signaling a more conservative capital structure and reduced reliance on debt financing. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability deteriorated markedly in 2024. Revenue declined to NZD 3,861 million from NZD 4,491 million, and gross profit fell to NZD 2,012 million (from NZD 2,073 million). All key margins contracted: gross margin dropped to 54.70% (from 59.88%), operating margin to 27.53% (from 35.76%), and net profit margin to 8.18% (from 25.27%). Net profit plummeted to NZD 316 million (from NZD 1,135 million), and return on equity fell sharply to 17.90% (from 66.47%), while return on assets decreased to 6.93% (from 26.18%). The effective tax rate swung from a negative (1.48%) to a much higher (38.52%), contributing to the lower net profit. The significant drop in profitability and margins, combined with a much higher tax burden, indicates weaker earnings quality in 2024. | Profitability improved substantially in 2023. Revenue grew to NZD 4,491 million from NZD 3,720 million, and net profit nearly tripled to NZD 1,135 million (from NZD 410 million). Gross margin was strong at 59.88%, and operating margin reached 35.76%. Net profit margin more than doubled to 25.27% (from 11.02%). Return on equity was exceptionally high at 66.47%, and return on assets was 26.18%, both indicating efficient use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate dropped sharply to (1.48%) from (29.43%), contributing to the surge in net profit. Interest coverage was extremely robust at 1622.22%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest obligations. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency weakened in 2024. Asset turnover declined to 84.70% (from 103.59%), indicating less effective use of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses were slightly reduced to NZD 949 million (from NZD 967 million), but this was insufficient to offset the revenue decline. Net cash from operations decreased to NZD 764 million (from NZD 800 million), reflecting lower cash generation from core activities. Working capital pressure is evident as current liabilities increased more than current assets, and the current ratio dropped to near parity. Inventory levels rose slightly to NZD 89 million (from NZD 79 million), but this did not materially impact overall efficiency. Net cash from investing turned negative at (NZD 550 million), suggesting increased capital expenditure or investment outflows. Overall, the company’s ability to convert assets and operations into cash and revenue weakened in 2024. | Operational efficiency was strong in 2023. Operating expenses fell sharply to NZD 967 million from NZD 2,570 million, supporting a significant increase in operating income (NZD 1,606 million). Asset turnover was high at 103.59%, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations was stable at NZD 800 million (vs. NZD 841 million in 2022), while working capital remained positive with current assets exceeding current liabilities. Inventory levels decreased to NZD 79 million from NZD 107 million, suggesting improved inventory management. Net cash from investing turned positive at NZD 425 million (from negative NZD 492 million), while net cash from financing was a significant outflow at NZD (1,196) million, likely reflecting debt repayments or dividend distributions. The company ended the year with a net increase in cash of NZD 29 million. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk increased in 2024. The debt to equity ratio rose sharply to 191.51%, indicating higher leverage and greater financial risk. The current ratio fell to 100.94%, just above breakeven, highlighting potential liquidity concerns. Interest expense increased to NZD 144 million (from NZD 99 million), and interest coverage dropped to 738.19% (from 1,622.22%), though still at a comfortable level, the trend is negative. The effective tax rate increased significantly to (38.52%), which, combined with lower pre-tax income, further pressured net results. The decline in retained earnings and equity, alongside higher liabilities, signals increased vulnerability to financial shocks. No geographic diversification data is available to assess concentration risk. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023. The debt to equity ratio declined to 131.03%, reducing leverage risk. The current ratio remained above 1, indicating adequate liquidity. Interest coverage was extremely high at 1622.22%, minimizing short-term solvency risk. The effective tax rate was unusually low at (1.48%), which may not be sustainable and could pose a risk if tax obligations normalize. Net cash from financing was a large outflow, which, if related to debt repayment, reduces future interest risk but could constrain liquidity if not managed carefully. No geographic revenue breakdown is available, limiting assessment of concentration risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | Future performance faces headwinds. The negative net cash from investing (NZD 550 million) suggests ongoing or increased investment activity, which could support future growth if returns materialize. However, the sustainability of cash flows is in question as net cash from operations declined and net cash from financing was negative (NZD 255 million), possibly reflecting debt repayments or reduced new borrowings. Dividend payments increased slightly to NZD 494 million (from NZD 486 million), which may strain cash reserves given lower profits and cash flow. Segment data shows mobile revenue was stable, but most other segments (notably voice, IT services, procurement and partners, and broadband) declined, with only high-tech and data centres showing growth. This points to a need for successful execution in growth segments to offset declines elsewhere. Overall, unless profitability and cash generation recover, the current dividend policy and investment pace may not be sustainable. | Spark New Zealand Limited's 2023 results position it well for future performance. The positive net cash from investing (NZD 425 million) suggests divestments or reduced capital expenditure, which may impact future growth if not reinvested. The large dividend payment (NZD 486 million) and strong retained earnings indicate a shareholder-friendly policy, but ongoing high payouts should be balanced against reinvestment needs. Revenue growth was broad-based, with mobile and procurement/partners segments leading, while voice revenue declined, reflecting industry trends. Sustained operational efficiency and improved capital structure support future resilience, but the abnormally low tax rate and reduced investment cash flows warrant monitoring for sustainability. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Spark faces market risks primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, managed through derivative financial instruments and a Board-approved treasury policy. The economic environment is challenging with high costs, elevated interest rates, and rising unemployment impacting customer behavior, especially in the SME sector with higher business closures and reduced government and private sector spending. Competition and market saturation affect traditional revenue streams like mobile and broadband, while new revenue streams face rapid technological changes and market acceptance risks. Transition risks include telecommunications market disruption from satellite and alternative technologies, regulation and government intervention potentially mandating inefficient investments, supply chain disruptions due to rapid adoption of low-emissions technologies, economic disruption from climate events and economic transformation, and meeting stakeholder expectations on ESG performance. Spark mitigates these risks by adapting strategies, engaging with satellite providers, advocating for coordinated regulation, maintaining flexible business plans, and integrating ESG into business strategy with clear governance and sustainability targets. | Spark faces market risks primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which can affect cash flows and financial performance. The economic environment, including rising interest rates, inflation, and a technical recession in New Zealand, impacts consumer behavior and business confidence, especially in the SME segment where business closures are increasing. Recent severe weather events also influence customer behavior and increase costs. Competition for skilled labor in key technology areas is high, with talent shortages and increased costs for attracting and retaining staff. Spark mitigates these risks through hedging strategies, workforce planning, succession projects, upskilling, and strategic development programs. Additionally, evolving industry trends such as digital transformation and climate-related opportunities are integrated into Spark's strategy to support New Zealand's transition to a low-carbon economy. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include potential damage to infrastructure from increased weather events and climate change, causing increased maintenance costs, customer disruptions, and higher insurance costs. Disruptions to supporting infrastructure such as passive tower infrastructure, electricity grid outages, fibre backhaul outages, and road transport damage can impact network availability. Supply chain disruptions from physical climate impacts and increased global demand for network spares can constrain equipment supply and affect customer device availability. Spark mitigates these risks through significant investments in network resilience, including site strengthening, geographically diverse data centres, battery life extension on critical sites, use of portable and fixed generators, satellite-connected temporary small cells, backup satellite backhaul, and collaboration with industry peers for coordinated disaster response. Business continuity and crisis management are governed by policies benchmarked to ISO 22301 and ISO 22313, with regular reviews and external testing to ensure effectiveness. Operational risk management processes in technology units provide visibility and coordinated responses to risks, supported by strong governance and formal delivery methodologies to ensure operational standards and customer service are maintained during cost optimizations and transformations. | Operational risks include exposure to cyber-attacks and data breaches, requiring robust security and privacy frameworks managed by dedicated teams and supported by external reviews and certifications. Business continuity risks arise from disruptive events such as extreme weather (e.g., Cyclone Gabrielle), which can cause power outages and infrastructure damage affecting network availability. Spark invests over $100 million annually in network resilience, including upgrading to a self-healing fibre backbone (OTN2.0) to enhance capacity and reliability. Supply chain risks involve increased lead times, costs, and potential disruptions due to global extreme weather and competition for resources, mitigated by enhanced supplier relationship management and adherence to a Supplier Code of Conduct. Operational challenges also include executing product simplification and customer migrations, managed through strong governance and formal delivery methodologies. Talent shortages and workforce challenges are addressed through internal talent mobility, internships, and targeted development programs.
