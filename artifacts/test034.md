Operating expenses increased from AUD 37,882,754 in 2022 to AUD 39,623,352 in 2023 and AUD 42,767,740 in 2024, but the rate of revenue growth and gross margin expansion outpaced expense growth, reflecting improved cost management and operating leverage. |

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Ai-Media Technologies Limited demonstrated a solid improvement in its financial health. Total assets decreased to AUD 93,139,500 from AUD 100,797,387 in 2023, primarily due to reductions in both current and non-current assets. However, total liabilities fell more sharply to AUD 17,226,897 from AUD 23,674,478, resulting in a stronger balance sheet. The current ratio improved to 189.69% (from 150.55%), indicating enhanced short-term liquidity and a comfortable buffer to cover current obligations. Shareholders' equity remained robust at AUD 75,912,603, only slightly lower than the prior year, despite continued negative retained earnings. The debt to equity ratio improved to 22.69% (from 30.70%), reflecting a more conservative capital structure with reduced reliance on debt financing. | In 2023, Ai-Media Technologies Limited reported total assets of AUD 100,797,387 and total liabilities of AUD 23,674,478, resulting in shareholders' equity of AUD 77,122,909. The current ratio stands at 150.55%, indicating a strong liquidity position with current assets (AUD 30,962,270) comfortably covering current liabilities (AUD 20,566,743). The company’s capital structure is conservative, with a debt to equity ratio of 30.70%, suggesting moderate leverage. Retained earnings remain negative at (AUD 42,220,386), reflecting accumulated losses, but the equity base is still substantial. Overall, the balance sheet demonstrates solid liquidity and manageable leverage, though persistent negative retained earnings highlight ongoing profitability challenges. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved in 2024, with revenue rising to AUD 66,236,058 (up from AUD 61,769,967). Gross profit increased to AUD 42,471,457, and the gross margin strengthened to 64.12% (from 59.67%), indicating better cost control or pricing power. Operating loss narrowed significantly to AUD -298,618 (from AUD -1,594,639), and the operating margin improved to -0.45% (from -2.58%). Net loss also reduced to AUD -1,340,996 (from AUD -4,017,064), and the net profit margin improved to -2.02% (from -6.50%). Return on equity improved to -1.75% (from -5.15%), and return on assets was -1.38%. The effective tax rate was highly negative at -352.61%, likely due to the interplay of losses and tax adjustments. Overall, while the company remains unprofitable, the quality of earnings improved with narrowing losses and stronger margins. | Profitability improved in 2023, with revenue rising to AUD 61,769,967 from AUD 59,784,026 in 2022. Gross profit increased to AUD 36,860,819, and gross margin strengthened to 59.67% (up from 54.98%). Operating loss narrowed to AUD -1,594,639 (from AUD -3,352,099), and net loss improved to AUD -4,017,064 (from AUD -4,923,715). Operating and net profit margins both improved, at (2.58%) and (6.50%) respectively, though still negative. Return on equity was (5.15%), indicating continued negative returns for shareholders. The effective tax rate spiked to 74.20%, driven by a high income tax expense relative to pre-tax loss, which may reflect non-recurring or non-cash tax items. Overall, while losses persist, margins and earnings quality are trending positively. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed notable gains in 2024. Cost of goods sold decreased to AUD 23,764,601 (from AUD 24,909,148) despite higher revenue, supporting the improved gross margin. Operating expenses rose slightly to AUD 42,767,740 (from AUD 39,623,352), but the increase was proportionally less than the revenue growth. Asset turnover was 68.31%, indicating moderate utilization of assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations was stable at AUD 3,566,414 (vs. AUD 3,477,003), suggesting consistent cash generation from core activities. However, net cash from investing was a significant outflow at AUD -9,297,098 (vs. AUD -1,648,578), likely reflecting increased investment activity. Working capital improved, as evidenced by the higher current ratio and lower current liabilities. Inventory levels increased to AUD 2,417,646 (from AUD 892,246), which may warrant monitoring for efficiency. | Operational efficiency showed improvement in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased to AUD 24,909,148 despite higher revenue, supporting the rise in gross margin. Operating expenses increased to AUD 39,623,352, but the growth in gross profit outpaced this, reducing the operating loss. Net cash from operations more than doubled to AUD 3,477,003 (from AUD 1,893,490), indicating better cash conversion from earnings. Inventory levels rose modestly to AUD 892,246. Net cash used in investing increased to AUD (1,648,578), suggesting ongoing investment in assets or technology. Net cash from financing was negative at AUD (280,990), reflecting limited new debt or equity issuance. The company generated a positive net increase in cash of AUD 1,547,435, highlighting improved cash flow management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators improved in 2024. The debt to equity ratio declined to 22.69%, and total liabilities dropped significantly, reducing leverage risk. The current ratio rose to 189.69%, indicating strong liquidity. Interest expense fell to AUD 162,487 (from AUD 761,594), and interest coverage, while still negative at -183.78%, improved from -209.38%. The effective tax rate was highly negative at -352.61%, which is unusual and may reflect deferred tax assets or other non-recurring tax items, representing a potential area of risk or volatility. The company remains loss-making, but the narrowing losses and improved liquidity reduce immediate financial distress risk. No dividend payments were made, preserving cash. | Financial risk remains moderate. The current ratio of 150.55% signals strong short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio of 30.70% indicates moderate leverage, and interest expense fell to AUD 761,594. Interest coverage improved but remains negative at (209.38%), as operating income is still negative, signaling ongoing risk in meeting interest obligations from operations. The effective tax rate was unusually high at 74.20%, likely due to non-standard tax items or deferred tax adjustments, which could introduce volatility. No dividend payments were made, preserving cash. While liquidity and leverage are well managed, continued operating losses and negative interest coverage are early warning signs that profitability must improve to ensure long-term financial stability. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company’s significant investment outflows in 2024 (AUD -9,297,098) suggest a focus on growth or transformation, particularly in technology, as technology revenue surpassed services revenue (AUD 32,921,310 vs. AUD 33,314,748). The shift in revenue mix and strong growth in North America (AUD 43,317,480, up from AUD 35,840,467) indicate strategic geographic and product focus. Cash flow from operations remains positive and stable, supporting ongoing operations, but the large investing outflows led to a net decrease in cash of AUD -5,991,921. The absence of dividends suggests a reinvestment strategy. If investments yield expected returns, future profitability and cash flow could improve, especially given the company’s improving margins and cost structure. However, continued monitoring of cash reserves and investment outcomes is warranted. | The company’s positive operating cash flow and net cash increase in 2023 provide a foundation for future investment and operational stability. Ongoing investment outflows suggest a focus on technology and service development. No dividends were paid, indicating a priority on reinvestment or cash preservation. Revenue growth was driven by both Services (AUD 37,799,014) and Technology (AUD 23,970,953), with North America remaining the largest geographic market (AUD 35,840,467). The shift in revenue mix and geographic expansion, particularly in APAC and EMEA, may support future growth. However, persistent net losses and negative retained earnings highlight the need for continued margin improvement and cost control. If current trends in margin and cash flow improvement continue, the company is positioned for gradual financial recovery, but risks remain until sustained profitability is achieved. |
