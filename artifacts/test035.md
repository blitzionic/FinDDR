# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Metcash Limited's revenue increased steadily from AUD 15,164.8 million in 2022 to AUD 15,803.4 million in 2023 and reached AUD 15,912.4 million in 2024. Gross profit also rose from AUD 1,682.5 million in 2022 to AUD 1,842.3 million in 2023 and further to AUD 1,941.7 million in 2024. The gross margin improved each year, from 11.09% in 2022 to 11.66% in 2023 and 12.20% in 2024, indicating enhanced cost control or pricing power. By product, Food remained the largest contributor (2024: AUD 8,307.8 million), followed by Liquor (AUD 5,133.6 million) and Hardware (AUD 2,471.0 million). Hardware revenue showed the strongest growth, rising from AUD 2,033.1 million in 2022 to AUD 2,344.1 million in 2023 and AUD 2,471.0 million in 2024. Geographically, Australia consistently accounted for approximately 95% of total revenue across all three years, with New Zealand contributing less than 5%. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 3.95% in 2022 to 2.91% in 2023 and further to 2.86% in 2024, despite rising gross margins. Operating income decreased from AUD 599.3 million in 2022 to AUD 460.6 million in 2023 and AUD 454.3 million in 2024, while revenue increased, indicating that operating expenses grew faster than revenue. Operating expenses rose sharply from AUD 1,083.2 million in 2022 to AUD 1,381.7 million in 2023 and further to AUD 1,487.4 million in 2024, suggesting cost pressures or increased investment in operations. This erosion in operating efficiency offset improvements in gross margin, resulting in relatively flat net profit margins (2024: 1.62%, 2023: 1.65%, 2022: 1.62%). |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, at 31.02% in 2022, 30.86% in 2023, and 30.58% in 2024, with only a slight decrease over the period, resulting in minimal impact on net profitability. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Metcash Limited demonstrated a strengthened financial position. Total assets increased to AUD 5,796.4 million from AUD 5,379.1 million in 2023, driven by growth in both current and non-current assets. Total liabilities slightly decreased to AUD 4,268.0 million (from AUD 4,294.0 million), with reductions in both current and non-current liabilities. Shareholders' equity rose significantly to AUD 1,528.4 million (from AUD 1,085.1 million), reflecting improved retained earnings and overall capital structure. The current ratio improved to 112.94% (from 106.73%), indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. Debt to equity declined markedly to 279.25% (from 395.72%), signaling a less leveraged balance sheet and a shift toward equity financing. Overall, the company’s capital structure is more robust, with improved liquidity and lower relative leverage. | In 2023, Metcash Limited's total assets increased to AUD 5,379.1 million from AUD 5,200.9 million in 2022, indicating asset growth. Current assets rose slightly to AUD 3,091.4 million, while non-current assets increased to AUD 2,287.7 million. Total liabilities also increased to AUD 4,294.0 million (from AUD 4,110.5 million), with current liabilities at AUD 2,896.4 million and non-current liabilities at AUD 1,397.6 million. Shareholders' equity marginally decreased to AUD 1,085.1 million (from AUD 1,090.4 million), and retained earnings declined to AUD 257.2 million. The current ratio decreased to 106.73% (from 111.79%), suggesting a slight weakening in short-term liquidity but still above 1.0. The debt to equity ratio rose to 395.72% (from 376.97%), reflecting a highly leveraged capital structure with increasing reliance on debt financing. Overall, while asset growth is positive, the company’s high leverage and declining equity position warrant close monitoring. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 was stable but showed slight margin compression. Revenue grew modestly to AUD 15,912.4 million (from AUD 15,803.4 million). Gross profit increased to AUD 1,941.7 million, and gross margin improved to 12.20% (from 11.66%), indicating better cost of goods sold management. However, operating expenses rose to AUD 1,487.4 million, resulting in a slight decrease in operating income to AUD 454.3 million and a marginally lower operating margin of 2.86% (from 2.91%). Net profit was AUD 258.1 million, with a net margin of 1.62% (down from 1.65%). Return on equity decreased to 19.75% (from 23.93%), and return on assets fell to 4.62% (from 4.92%), reflecting lower earnings relative to the expanded asset and equity base. The effective tax rate remained stable at 30.58%. Overall, while revenue and gross profit improved, higher operating expenses and interest costs slightly eroded margins and returns. | Metcash reported revenue growth in 2023, reaching AUD 15,803.4 million (up from AUD 15,164.8 million). Gross profit improved to AUD 1,842.3 million, with gross margin rising to 11.66% (from 11.09%), indicating better cost of goods sold management. However, operating income declined to AUD 460.6 million (from AUD 599.3 million), and operating margin fell to 2.91% (from 3.95%), reflecting increased operating expenses (AUD 1,381.7 million vs. AUD 1,083.2 million). Net profit increased to AUD 260.3 million (from AUD 245.4 million), and net profit margin slightly improved to 1.65%. Return on equity was strong at 23.93%, and return on assets was 4.92%. The effective tax rate remained stable at 30.86%. Overall, while top-line and net profit improved, the decline in operating margin and income suggests pressure from rising operating costs. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 showed mixed results. Asset turnover declined to 284.77% (from 298.74%), indicating slightly less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Inventory levels increased modestly to AUD 1,196.9 million. Net cash from operations improved significantly to AUD 482.6 million (from AUD 372.7 million), suggesting better working capital management and cash conversion. Net cash used in investing activities increased to AUD (287.9) million, indicating higher capital expenditure or investment outflows. Net cash used in financing activities decreased to AUD (186.9) million, and dividend payments were reduced to AUD (155.3) million (from AUD (226.6) million), supporting cash retention. The company achieved a positive net increase in cash of AUD 7.8 million (versus a decrease of AUD 15.2 million in 2023), reflecting improved cash flow management. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed results. Asset turnover was 298.74%, indicating effective use of assets to generate revenue. Inventory increased to AUD 1,183.4 million, which may reflect higher sales or potential inventory buildup. Net cash from operations decreased to AUD 372.7 million (from AUD 432.3 million), suggesting reduced cash generation from core activities. Net cash used in investing increased to AUD (156.6) million, indicating higher investment activity. Net cash used in financing was lower at AUD (231.3) million, and dividends paid increased to AUD (226.6) million. The net decrease in cash was AUD (15.2) million, a slight improvement over 2022. The increase in operating expenses and lower operating cash flow point to some challenges in cost control and working capital management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 generally improved. The current ratio rose to 112.94%, enhancing liquidity. Debt to equity dropped to 279.25%, reducing financial leverage risk. Interest expense increased to AUD 92.6 million (from AUD 64.7 million), but interest coverage, while lower at 490.60% (from 711.90%), remains strong and indicates ample ability to service debt. The effective tax rate was stable at 30.58%. No significant tax rate changes or geographic concentration risks were observed, as revenue remains heavily weighted toward Australia (~95%). The reduction in dividend payments and net cash outflows from financing also suggest a more conservative financial posture. However, the increase in interest expense and lower interest coverage warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 highlight several areas of concern. The debt to equity ratio increased to 395.72%, underscoring high leverage. The current ratio declined to 106.73%, indicating slightly reduced liquidity. Interest expense rose to AUD 64.7 million, and interest coverage dropped to 711.90% (from 1235.67%), though still at a comfortable level. The effective tax rate remained stable at 30.86%. The combination of high leverage, rising interest expense, and declining liquidity could increase financial risk if not managed carefully. No significant changes in tax rate were observed. The company should monitor its debt levels and liquidity closely to mitigate potential risks. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Metcash Limited’s increased investment outflows (net cash from investing at AUD (287.9) million) suggest ongoing capital investment, potentially supporting future growth. The improved operating cash flow and reduced dividend payments enhance cash flow sustainability and provide flexibility for further investment or debt reduction. Segment data shows hardware and liquor revenue growth (hardware: AUD 2,471.0 million, liquor: AUD 5,133.6 million), while food revenue declined slightly, indicating potential growth opportunities in hardware and liquor. Geographic revenue concentration remains unchanged, with limited exposure outside Australia. The strengthened balance sheet, improved liquidity, and lower leverage position the company well for future stability, though continued margin pressure and rising interest costs should be monitored. | Looking ahead, Metcash’s increased investment outflows (AUD 156.6 million) suggest ongoing capital expenditure, which could support future growth. However, the decline in operating cash flow and continued high dividend payments (AUD 226.6 million) may pressure cash reserves if not offset by improved earnings or cash generation. Revenue growth was broad-based across all segments: Food (AUD 8,410.1 million), Hardware (AUD 2,344.1 million), and Liquor (AUD 5,049.2 million), with Australia remaining the dominant market. Sustained growth in these segments, especially Hardware and Liquor, could support future performance. However, the high leverage and declining liquidity highlight the need for prudent financial management to ensure cash flow sustainability and maintain dividend policy. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Metcash faces market risks from increased competition including acquisitions by competitors of independent stores, competitors soliciting customers to operate under non-Metcash banners, price wars, new market entrants with wholesaler models, customers forming buying groups, and indirect competitors changing business models. Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks include inflation, interest rate variability, changes in government fiscal policies, energy and input cost variability, and geopolitical tensions that may disrupt supply chains and increase costs. Changes in consumer behavior, such as cost-conscious purchasing and healthy living trends, also pose risks. The company manages these risks through strategic planning, execution of initiatives, maintaining vigilance over cost structures, and forecasting and planning to maintain supply levels. | Metcash faces market risks from increased competitive activity including acquisitions by competitors, new market entrants with disruptive models, suppliers selling directly to customers, customers forming buying groups, and indirect competitors changing business models. Changes in consumer behavior and preferences influenced by economic conditions, digital disruption, healthy living trends, sustainability preferences, and increased retail options may impact sales mix and earnings. Macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rate variability, government fiscal policy, energy and input costs, and geopolitical tensions (trade wars, territorial disputes, war) may adversely affect customers, supply chains, costs, and profitability. Tobacco sales are impacted by healthy living trends, cost of living pressures, and illicit tobacco supply. Large customers (Multiple Store Owners and contract customers) reducing or ceasing sourcing from Metcash could adversely impact long-term performance. Risk mitigation includes delivery of strategic plans, execution of initiatives, building strong retailer and supplier relationships, and maintaining a healthy retail network. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include reliance on the success of suppliers and retailers, risks associated with transformation programs such as delays, cost overruns, or failure to deliver benefits, and potential disruption or inefficiency in supply chain and key support systems. Technology and cyber security risks arise from reliance on complex IT systems, risks related to the Program Horizon transformation project, outsourcing to Tata Consulting Services, and increasing cyber threats.
