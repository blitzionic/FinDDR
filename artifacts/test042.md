# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Compass Minerals International, Inc. experienced a consistent decline in total revenue from USD 1,245.2 million in 2022 to USD 1,204.7 million in 2023, and further to USD 1,117.4 million in 2024. Gross margin improved from 16.05% in 2022 to 19.26% in 2023, but then declined to 17.45% in 2024. By product, Salt Sales decreased from $1,011.4 million in 2022 to $1,010.8 million in 2023 and then to $907.8 million in 2024, while Plant Nutrition Sales dropped from $222.3 million in 2022 to $172.1 million in 2023 and slightly increased to $181.0 million in 2024. Geographically, the U.S. remained the dominant market, accounting for 74% of 2024 revenue, with U.S. revenue at $860.4 million in 2023 and $894.9 million in 2022, while Canada and the U.K. together contributed 26% in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 3.65% in 2022 to 6.42% in 2023, but sharply deteriorated to (10.45%) in 2024. Operating income followed a similar trend, rising from $45.4 million in 2022 to $77.4 million in 2023, then dropping to a loss of $(116.8) million in 2024, despite revenue only declining by $87.3 million from 2023 to 2024. Operating expenses remained stable at $154.4 million in 2022 and $154.6 million in 2023, but surged to $311.8 million in 2024, indicating significant cost management challenges that contributed to the negative operating income and margin in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate was highly volatile, at 16,750.00% in 2022, dropping to 61.96% in 2023, and turning negative at (9.51%) in 2024, which likely impacted net profitability, especially in 2022 and 2023. No explicit non-recurring items are listed in the provided data. No external factors affecting profitability are explicitly mentioned in the financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Compass Minerals International, Inc. experienced a notable deterioration in its financial health. Total assets declined to $1,640.1 million from $1,816.9 million in 2023, primarily due to a reduction in non-current assets. Total liabilities increased to $1,323.5 million (up from $1,295.9 million), driven by a rise in non-current liabilities, while current liabilities decreased to $217.0 million. Shareholders' equity fell sharply to $316.6 million from $521.0 million, reflecting a significant erosion of retained earnings (down to $2.2 million from $220.9 million). The current ratio improved to 270.65% (from 218.83%), indicating strong short-term liquidity, but the debt to equity ratio surged to 418.04% (from 248.73%), highlighting a much more leveraged capital structure and increased long-term solvency risk. | In 2023, Compass Minerals International, Inc. demonstrated a notable strengthening of its financial position. Total assets increased to $1,816.9 million from $1,652.4 million in 2022, driven by growth in both current and non-current assets. Shareholders' equity nearly doubled to $521.0 million from $265.2 million, reflecting improved profitability and possibly capital infusions. Total liabilities decreased to $1,295.9 million from $1,387.1 million, with a significant reduction in non-current liabilities (down to $1,021.3 million from $1,154.0 million), though current liabilities rose to $274.6 million. The current ratio, while still robust at 218.83%, declined from 241.10%, indicating slightly reduced short-term liquidity but still well above typical benchmarks. The debt to equity ratio improved markedly to 248.73% from 523.04%, signaling a much healthier capital structure with reduced leverage. Retained earnings decreased to $220.9 million from $235.3 million, likely due to dividend payments exceeding net profit. Overall, the company’s balance sheet in 2023 reflects improved solvency, lower leverage, and strong liquidity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 worsened significantly. Revenue declined to $1,117.4 million (from $1,204.7 million), and gross profit dropped to $195.0 million. Gross margin narrowed to 17.45% (from 19.26%). Operating expenses nearly doubled to $311.8 million, resulting in a negative operating income of $(116.8) million and an operating margin of (10.45%), compared to a positive 6.42% in 2023. Net profit turned sharply negative at $(206.1) million, with a net margin of (18.44%) versus 0.87% previously. Return on equity and return on assets both turned deeply negative at (49.21%) and (11.92%), respectively, indicating significant value destruction for shareholders and poor asset utilization. The effective tax rate was negative at (9.51%), reflecting the pre-tax loss position. | Profitability improved in 2023 despite a slight decline in revenue to $1,204.7 million from $1,245.2 million. Gross profit rose to $232.0 million (up from $199.8 million), and gross margin expanded to 19.26% from 16.05%, indicating better cost control or pricing. Operating income increased to $77.4 million from $45.4 million, with operating margin rising to 6.42% from 3.65%. Net profit turned positive at $10.5 million, reversing a net loss of $(21.1) million in 2022, and net profit margin improved to 0.87% from (1.69%). Return on equity (ROE) was 2.67% and return on assets (ROA) was 0.61%, both positive, though modest. The effective tax rate normalized to 61.96% from an anomalously high 16,750% in 2022. Overall, earnings quality improved, with higher margins and a return to profitability, though net margins remain thin. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency declined in 2024. Asset turnover decreased to 64.65% from 69.45%, indicating less effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations plummeted to $14.4 million (from $106.0 million), suggesting weaker cash generation from core activities. Inventories increased to $414.1 million, potentially signaling slower inventory turnover or demand issues. Working capital improved as current liabilities fell, but this was offset by the overall decline in profitability and cash flow. Net cash used in investing was $(116.1) million, lower than the prior year, while net cash from financing increased to $83.1 million, likely reflecting increased reliance on external funding. The net decrease in cash was $(18.5) million, a larger outflow than in 2023. | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased to $972.7 million from $1,045.4 million, supporting higher gross margins. Operating expenses were stable at $154.6 million. Asset turnover was 69.45%, indicating moderate utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations declined to $106.0 million from $120.4 million, suggesting some pressure on cash generation despite improved profitability. Inventories increased significantly to $399.5 million from $304.4 million, which may indicate slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. Working capital remains strong, with current assets of $600.9 million versus current liabilities of $274.6 million. However, net cash from investing was a larger outflow at $(177.9) million (vs. $(79.9) million), likely reflecting increased capital expenditures or investments. Net cash from financing was positive at $64.0 million, compared to an outflow in 2022, possibly due to new debt or equity issuance. The net decrease in cash of $(7.4) million contrasts with a net increase in 2022, highlighting higher investment outflows. Dividend payments increased to $(24.9) million. In summary, while operational profitability improved, cash flow from operations declined and inventory build-up warrants monitoring. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk increased in 2024. The debt to equity ratio rose sharply to 418.04%, indicating a much higher reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased to $69.5 million, and interest coverage turned negative at (168.06%), reflecting the company's inability to cover interest costs from operating income. The current ratio improved, but this is overshadowed by the significant decline in equity and profitability. The negative effective tax rate and large net loss are early warning signs of ongoing financial distress. The reduction in dividends paid (to $12.6 million from $24.9 million) may indicate efforts to conserve cash amid financial strain. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023. The debt to equity ratio fell sharply to 248.73% from 523.04%, reflecting reduced leverage and a stronger equity base. Interest coverage improved to 139.46% from 82.25%, indicating better ability to service debt from operating income. The current ratio, while lower, remains strong at 218.83%. The effective tax rate normalized to 61.96% from an extreme 16,750% in 2022, reducing tax-related volatility. However, the increase in current liabilities and inventories could signal potential liquidity or operational risks if not managed. The company’s net cash from operations declined, and net cash from investing was a significant outflow, which could pressure liquidity if sustained. Dividend payments exceeded net profit, reducing retained earnings. Overall, while leverage and interest coverage improved, attention should be paid to cash flow trends and inventory management. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Compass Minerals faces significant challenges. The sharp decline in net cash from operations and increased reliance on financing activities raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. Investment outflows decreased, possibly reflecting reduced capital expenditures or divestitures. The reduction in dividends suggests a more conservative capital allocation policy. Segment data shows Salt Sales declined to $907.8 million, while Plant Nutrition Sales increased modestly to $181.0 million, indicating some resilience in the latter segment. Geographically, the U.S. remains the dominant market (74% of revenue), but overall revenue contraction and margin compression signal the need for operational turnaround and cost control to restore profitability and financial stability. | Looking ahead, Compass Minerals International, Inc. appears to be investing heavily, as evidenced by the substantial increase in net cash used for investing activities ($(177.9) million in 2023). This could support future growth but may pressure short-term liquidity. The company’s ability to generate positive net profit and improved margins in 2023 is encouraging, but thin net margins and declining cash from operations suggest the need for continued focus on operational efficiency. Dividend payments increased despite modest net profit, which may not be sustainable if profitability does not improve further. Segment data shows Salt Sales remained stable ($1,010.8 million), while Plant Nutrition Sales declined to $172.1 million, indicating reliance on the salt segment. Geographically, U.S. and Canadian revenues declined, while U.K. revenue increased, suggesting some diversification but also potential regional headwinds. Sustained investment, improved capital structure, and margin expansion position the company for future growth, but cash flow sustainability and segment/geographic performance should be closely monitored. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Compass Minerals operates primarily through two core segments: Salt and Plant Nutrition. The company generates the vast majority of its revenue from product sales, specifically the production and sale of salt (sodium chloride and magnesium chloride) and sulfate of potash (SOP) specialty fertilizers. The Salt segment provides highway deicing salt, consumer deicing and water conditioning products, food-grade salt, and industrial salt products, primarily in North America and the U.K. Sales are made through annual tendered bid contracts, multi-year contracts, and direct sales to governmental entities, distributors, and retailers. The Plant Nutrition segment generates nearly all of its sales and earnings through the production and sale of SOP, marketed under the Protassium+ brand, to distributors, retailers, and growers, primarily in the U.S. (92% of segment sales in 2024). SOP is sold in various grades for use in high-value and chloride-sensitive crops, as well as turf and industrial applications. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the goods transfers to the customer, typically upon shipment. The company also has smaller operations in fire retardants (Fortress) and records management (DeepStore), but these are not material to overall results. Overall, Compass Minerals' business model is based on large-scale manufacturing, mining, and distribution of essential mineral products, with revenue primarily from product sales to a diversified customer base. | Compass Minerals operates primarily as a producer and marketer of essential minerals, with its business divided into two main segments: Salt and Plant Nutrition. The company generates revenue predominantly through the sale of physical products, including salt (sodium chloride and magnesium chloride) for highway deicing, consumer, industrial, chemical, water conditioning, and agricultural applications, as well as sulfate of potash (SOP) specialty fertilizers for high-value crops and turf. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of goods transfers to the customer, typically upon shipment. The Salt segment accounted for approximately 84% of total sales in fiscal 2023, with highway deicing salt making up 63% of Salt segment sales and consumer & industrial salt 37%. The Plant Nutrition segment generates nearly all its sales from SOP, marketed under the Protassium+ brand, sold to distributors, retailers, and growers, primarily in the U.S. (91% of segment sales in 2023). The company also operates a fire retardant business (Fortress), which supplies magnesium chloride-based fire retardants to the US Forest Service, and a records management business in the UK, though these are not material contributors to overall revenue. The company’s revenue model is based on product sales, with some service and equipment leasing components in the fire retardant business. Payment is typically due within 30 days of delivery, and the company does not generally offer product returns or credits. The company’s operations are supported by 12 production and packaging facilities in the U.S., Canada, and the UK, and it leverages extensive logistics and distribution networks, especially for salt products. |
| Market Position | Compass Minerals is a market leader in several of its key markets. In the Plant Nutrition segment, the company is the leading producer and marketer of sulfate of potash (SOP) in North America and operates the largest SOP production site in the Western Hemisphere. As the only SOP producer with production facilities in North America, Compass Minerals estimates its share of the North American SOP market is sizable, though a specific percentage is not provided. The company faces competition from imports, primarily from the European Union, but benefits from a logistically favorable production site near Ogden, Utah. Globally, SOP represents about 10% of all potash production, with 55% of global SOP capacity located in China. In the Salt segment, Compass Minerals is the third largest producer of consumer and industrial salt products in North America and operates the largest rock salt mine in the world (Goderich, Ontario) and the largest dedicated rock salt mine in the U.K. (Winsford, Cheshire). The company is a key supplier to the U.K.'s Highways Agency, with approximately 75% of U.K. highway deicing customers on multi-year contracts. In North America, Compass Minerals is among the largest private-label producers of water conditioning salt and table salt in Canada. The salt market is highly competitive and commoditized, with competition from both large multinational and regional producers, as well as importers, especially on the U.S. coasts. The company's competitive advantages include extensive, high-grade mineral deposits, favorable logistics and distribution networks, and strong brand recognition (e.g., Sifto, Protassium+). Other business lines, such as fire retardants (Fortress) and records management (DeepStore), do not have significant market share and are not material to the company's overall competitive position. | Compass Minerals is a market leader in several of its key markets. In the Plant Nutrition segment, it is the leading producer and marketer of sulfate of potash (SOP) in North America and the only SOP producer with production facilities in North America, giving it a sizable share of the North American SOP market. Globally, SOP represents about 9% of all potash production, with 55% of global SOP capacity located in China. The company’s SOP sales are primarily concentrated in the Western and Southeastern U.S., targeting high-value and chloride-sensitive crops. In the Salt segment, Compass Minerals operates the largest rock salt mine in the world (Goderich, Ontario) and the largest dedicated rock salt mine in the UK (Winsford, Cheshire). It is a key supplier of highway deicing salt in North America and the UK, with an extensive distribution network and favorable logistics, and is viewed as a key supplier by the UK’s Highways Agency. The company is the third largest producer of consumer and industrial salt products in North America and is among the largest private-label producers of water conditioning salt in North America and table salt in Canada. The salt market is highly competitive and commoditized, with competition based on price, logistics, and service, but Compass Minerals’ advantageous geographic locations and distribution network provide a competitive edge. In the fire retardant market, Fortress is a new entrant and the only alternative to fertilizer-based fire retardants approved by the USFS, but this business is not yet material in size. The records management business in the UK (DeepStore) does not have a significant market share. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of total sales. Overall, Compass Minerals is a market leader in North American SOP and a leading, though not dominant, player in salt markets, with strong competitive advantages in logistics, production scale, and geographic positioning. |


# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Compass Minerals faces significant market risks including seasonality in demand for salt, plant nutrition, and fire retardant products, which are highly dependent on weather conditions such as snow events, rainfall, and drought. Demand volatility can lead to inventory imbalances, increased storage costs, or inventory write-downs. The plant nutrition segment is sensitive to potash price fluctuations and grower application rates influenced by crop prices, input costs, and economic conditions. The company faces strong competition from larger and more diversified competitors, with competition based on product quality, price, logistics, and customer service. Technological advances or substitutes could reduce demand for their products. International operations expose the company to currency fluctuations, inflation, political instability, tariffs, and trade protection measures, which can affect sales and costs. Hedging activities are used to mitigate foreign currency and commodity price risks but may not fully eliminate exposure. Changes in economic and political environments in Canada and the U.K. also pose risks.

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Risk assessment procedures | Compass Minerals International, Inc. uses the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as the basis for evaluating internal control over financial reporting. However, due to limited allocation of trained, knowledgeable resources, the Company did not conduct an effective risk assessment process to identify and evaluate all relevant risks of material misstatement, including fraud risks associated with transaction approvals, at a sufficient level of detail. Cybersecurity risk assessment is integrated into the enterprise risk management (ERM) program, which includes continuous monitoring systems and technologies, application and modification of cybersecurity policies and procedures, administrative, technical and physical controls, employee training, and awareness initiatives. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated alongside other critical business risks under the ERM program and are subject to oversight by the Board of Directors. The internal audit department independently performs an annual risk assessment, including cybersecurity risks. Third-party independent cybersecurity consultants and auditors periodically assess and enhance cybersecurity risk assessment and practices through penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. | The Company uses the COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) as criteria for evaluating internal control over financial reporting. Management conducts evaluations and assessments of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls, including disclosure controls and procedures, under the supervision and participation of senior executives such as the CEO and CFO. Risk identification and evaluation involve management judgment, including cost-benefit considerations, recognizing inherent limitations in control systems. Specific methodologies include management's evaluation of control design and operation, and the use of third-party qualified consultants for valuation and technical assessments in business combinations and goodwill impairment testing. The Company also monitors risks related to IT general controls, sales processes, and inventory existence, and implements remediation plans accordingly. |
| Control activities | The Company implements control activities based on the COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Control activities include policies and procedures designed to ensure accurate and fair recording of transactions, authorization of receipts and expenditures, and prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets.

Employee training and awareness programs are part of control activities to mitigate cybersecurity risks. | Control activities include disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure timely and accurate reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company maintains policies and procedures to control privileged user access to systems supporting financial reporting, pricing and order entry controls in the sales process, and controls over inventory existence at certain locations. The Company has a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to all employees and directors. Control activities also encompass management review controls, operational procedures for mining and production, compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations, and adherence to accounting standards such as ASC Topic 805 for business combinations and ASC Topic 350 for goodwill. The Company uses automated and manual business process controls, and has implemented SafeStart® safety methodology and environmental, health and safety frameworks that go beyond compliance. |
| Monitoring mechanisms | Monitoring mechanisms include management's evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, with participation from the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and oversight by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of the Board reviews cybersecurity frameworks, policies, programs, risks, and incidents with management and legal advisors. The Audit Committee receives regular updates and may request follow-up data or presentations. The Company employs continuous monitoring systems and managed detection and response services providing 24x7x365 monitoring, threat hunting, remediation, and escalation. Incident response teams are established for significant cybersecurity incidents, involving crisis management and subject matter experts. The internal audit department independently performs annual risk assessments, including cybersecurity. Third-party independent cybersecurity consultants conduct periodic assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments. The Company monitors safety performance through safety committees at operational sites and uses key performance indicators for safety and environmental compliance. | Monitoring mechanisms include management's ongoing evaluation of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, with participation from the CEO, CFO, and Chief Accounting Officer. The Audit Committee of the Board oversees internal control matters. The Company engages independent registered public accounting firms (Ernst & Young LLP) to audit internal controls and financial statements, providing an external opinion on effectiveness based on COSO criteria. Safety committees at operational sites, including employee and management representatives, monitor health and safety performance. The Company conducts periodic reviews, including management's assessment of control effectiveness as of fiscal year-end, and monitors remediation progress on identified material weaknesses. Internal controls are also monitored through continuous improvement initiatives and increased frequency of privileged access reviews. |
| Identified material weaknesses or deficiencies | Material weaknesses identified include: (1) Ineffective risk assessment process due to limited allocation of trained, knowledgeable resources, resulting in failure to identify and evaluate all relevant risks of material misstatement, including fraud risks related to transaction approvals; (2) Ineffective information and communication processes that failed to identify and assess sources and controls necessary to ensure reliability of information used in financial reporting, and to ensure complete, reliable information was timely available to financial reporting personnel. These weaknesses caused internal control deficiencies related to the design and operation of process-level controls to be ineffective throughout the Company's financial reporting processes. These material weaknesses were not remediated as of September 30, 2024. | During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company identified three material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting: (1) Ineffective information technology general controls related to privileged user access to certain systems, which adversely impacted automated and manual business process controls; (2) Inadequate controls over pricing and order entry in the sales process; (3) Inadequate controls related to the existence of inventory held at certain locations. These material weaknesses did not result in identified misstatements to the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2022. The Company has since defined and enhanced management review controls, improved the control environment, increased privileged access reviews, and implemented enhanced internal controls over sales and inventory processes in accordance with remediation plans. |
| Effectiveness | Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, using the COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the identified material weaknesses. The independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. The Board of Directors and Audit Committee provide oversight of internal controls and cybersecurity risks. Disclosure controls and procedures were also deemed ineffective as a result of the material weaknesses. Management is developing a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses, which will be monitored and tested for effectiveness in future assessments. | Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, using COSO (2013) criteria, including enhanced controls addressing previously identified material weaknesses. Management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of that date. The independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting and expressed an unqualified opinion that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting in all material respects as of September 30, 2023, based on COSO criteria. Management's assessment excluded internal controls related to the Fortress business acquired in May 2023, which accounted for approximately 8% of total assets and less than 1% of sales. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control. |
