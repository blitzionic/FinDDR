## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Centene Corporation demonstrates a solid financial position. Total assets stand at $82,445 million, a slight decrease from $84,641 million in 2023, primarily due to a reduction in current assets (from $40,756 million to $37,999 million), while non-current assets increased modestly. Total liabilities decreased to $55,935 million from $58,685 million, with both current and non-current liabilities declining. Shareholders' equity increased to $26,500 million from $25,937 million, and retained earnings rose significantly to $15,348 million from $12,043 million, reflecting improved profitability. The current ratio remains stable at 110.91% (2023: 111.00%), indicating consistent short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved to 211.08% from 226.26%, suggesting a more conservative capital structure and reduced leverage. Overall, the company’s balance sheet in 2024 reflects improved equity, lower leverage, and stable liquidity. | Centene Corporation demonstrated an improvement in overall financial health in 2023. Total assets increased to $84,641 million from $76,870 million in 2022, driven primarily by a significant rise in current assets (from $30,128 million to $40,756 million), while non-current assets declined slightly. Total liabilities also increased to $58,685 million (from $52,633 million), with current liabilities rising more sharply than non-current liabilities. Shareholders' equity grew to $25,937 million (from $24,181 million), and retained earnings increased to $12,043 million (from $9,341 million), reflecting improved profitability. The current ratio improved to 111.00% (from 105.85%), indicating slightly better short-term liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio rose to 226.26% (from 217.66%), suggesting a higher reliance on leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved in 2024. Revenue increased to $163,071 million (2023: $153,999 million), and net profit rose to $3,294 million (2023: $2,699 million). Gross margin improved to 21.24% (2023: 20.48%), and operating margin edged up to 1.95% (2023: 1.90%). Net profit margin increased to 2.02% from 1.75%, indicating better cost management and earnings quality. Return on equity (ROE) rose to 12.56% (2023: 10.77%), and return on assets (ROA) increased to 3.94% (2023: 3.34%), both reflecting enhanced profitability and efficient use of capital. The effective tax rate decreased to 22.62% from 24.99%, supporting net income growth. Overall, Centene’s 2024 earnings quality is strong, with improved margins and returns. | Profitability improved across all major metrics in 2023. Revenue grew to $153,999 million (up from $144,547 million), and gross profit increased to $17,637 million. Gross margin expanded to 20.48% (from 17.98%), and operating margin doubled to 1.90% (from 0.91%), indicating better cost management and operational leverage. Net profit more than doubled to $2,699 million (from $1,202 million), with net profit margin rising to 1.75% (from 0.83%). Return on equity was reported at 10.77% and return on assets at 3.34%, both indicating solid returns relative to capital employed. The effective tax rate decreased significantly to 24.99% (from 38.74%), supporting net income growth. Overall, earnings quality improved, with higher margins and returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 shows mixed signals. Asset turnover increased to 195.19% (2023: 190.70%), indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses rose to $31,460 million (2023: $28,611 million), but the company still achieved higher operating income ($3,175 million vs. $2,930 million). However, net cash from operations dropped sharply to $154 million from $8,053 million, signaling potential issues in working capital management or cash conversion. Net cash used in investing and financing activities remained negative, with higher outflows in financing ($2,406 million vs. $1,658 million). The net decrease in cash was $3,296 million, a reversal from the $5,172 million increase in 2023. While profitability and asset utilization improved, the significant decline in operating cash flow is a concern for operational efficiency. | Operational efficiency strengthened in 2023. Cost of goods sold increased at a slower pace than revenue, supporting margin expansion. Operating expenses rose to $28,611 million (from $24,668 million), but the increase in operating income to $2,930 million (from $1,318 million) suggests improved cost control relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover was reported at 190.70%, indicating strong utilization of assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations increased to $8,053 million (from $6,261 million), reflecting robust cash generation. Net cash used in investing decreased to $(1,191) million, and net cash used in financing also declined, resulting in a positive net increase in cash of $5,172 million (compared to a decrease of $868 million in 2022). Working capital improved, as evidenced by the rise in current assets outpacing current liabilities. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Centene’s financial risk profile in 2024 shows improvement in leverage and coverage metrics. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 211.08% (2023: 226.26%), and interest coverage improved to 452.28% (2023: 404.14%), indicating a stronger ability to service debt. The current ratio remains stable at 110.91%, suggesting adequate liquidity. The effective tax rate declined to 22.62% from 24.99%, reducing tax burden. However, the dramatic drop in net cash from operations and the net cash outflow of $3,296 million raise early warning signals regarding liquidity and cash management. No dividend data is available for 2024. Overall, while leverage and coverage improved, the cash flow situation warrants close monitoring. | Financial risk indicators present a mixed picture. The current ratio improved to 111.00%, suggesting adequate liquidity to cover short-term obligations. However, the debt to equity ratio increased to 226.26%, indicating higher leverage and potential vulnerability to changes in credit conditions. Interest expense rose slightly, but interest coverage more than doubled to 404.14% (from 198.20%), reflecting a much stronger ability to service debt from operating income. The effective tax rate dropped significantly, which may not be sustainable and could pose a risk if it normalizes upward. No dividend data is available, and there is no information on inventories or geographic revenue diversification. Overall, while liquidity and interest coverage improved, the higher leverage warrants monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Centene’s increased retained earnings and equity position provide a solid foundation for future growth. The company continues to invest, as seen in the negative cash flow from investing activities, though at a slightly lower level than 2023. The sharp decline in operating cash flow and net cash outflow may constrain future investment or require attention to working capital. Revenue growth is driven primarily by the Commercial segment, which increased significantly to $33,702 million (2023: $24,845 million), while Medicaid and Medicare revenues were relatively stable. This shift suggests a strategic focus on the Commercial market. No dividend policy information is available. Sustained profitability, improved margins, and a stronger capital structure support a positive outlook, but future performance will depend on restoring operating cash flow and maintaining liquidity. | Centene's 2023 financials suggest a positive outlook for future performance. The company reduced net cash outflows from investing and financing activities, and generated strong operational cash flow, resulting in a substantial increase in cash reserves. The absence of dividend payments may indicate a focus on reinvestment or debt reduction. Revenue growth was driven by Medicaid and Commercial segments, with Medicaid revenue rising to $100,759 million and Commercial to $24,845 million, while Medicare and Other segments were flat or declined. This concentration in Medicaid and Commercial may shape future growth opportunities and risks. Sustained cash flow generation and improved profitability support future investment capacity, but the elevated leverage and reliance on specific segments should be monitored for potential impact on long-term sustainability. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Centene Corporation operates primarily as a managed care organization (MCO) providing managed healthcare products and services through four main segments: Medicaid, Medicare, Commercial, and Other. The company generates the majority of its revenue from premiums received from state Medicaid agencies, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and members of its commercial health plans. These premiums are typically paid on a fixed per member per month basis under government contracts (capitation), with some contracts subject to risk adjustment based on member acuity. Additional revenue is generated from subsidies (e.g., CMS subsidies for Marketplace plans), performance-based incentives, and supplemental services. The Commercial segment includes products offered through the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace (Ambetter Health) and employer group plans. The Other segment includes specialty pharmacy (AcariaHealth), behavioral health (Magellan Health), vision and dental services (Envolve Benefit Options), clinical healthcare, and administrative services (e.g., TRICARE contract, which concluded in 2024). Specialty companies generate revenue through contracts with state and federal programs, healthcare organizations, and commercial entities, with revenue recognized as services are provided. Centene's business model is thus primarily based on capitation and premium-based managed care, supplemented by service fees and performance-based payments for specialty and administrative services. | Centene Corporation's primary business model is managed healthcare, focusing on government-sponsored and subsidized health insurance programs. The company operates through four main segments: Medicaid, Medicare, Commercial, and Other. The majority of revenue is generated from premiums received from state Medicaid agencies, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for Medicare products, and members of commercial health plans. Premiums are typically paid on a per member per month basis, with risk adjustment mechanisms based on the acuity of the membership. In the Commercial segment, revenues also include subsidies from CMS for Marketplace products. The company also generates service revenue from specialty pharmacy, behavioral health, vision and dental services, clinical healthcare, and administrative services (e.g., TRICARE contract for the Department of Defense). In 2023, external revenues by segment were: Medicaid (66%), Medicare (14%), Commercial (16%), and Other (4%). Centene's business model is characterized by long-term contracts with government agencies, value-based provider arrangements, and a local approach to care delivery. The company has transitioned its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business to a third party as of January 2023, but continues to provide certain pharmacy and specialty pharmacy services. |
| Market Position | Centene is a market leader in several key segments of the U.S. healthcare industry. As of December 31, 2024, Centene is the largest Medicaid health insurer in the country, serving more than 13 million Medicaid recipients in 30 states. It is also the largest Marketplace carrier, serving 4.4 million members across 29 states under the Ambetter Health brand. In Medicare, Centene serves 1.1 million Medicare Advantage members across 37 states (primarily under the Wellcare brand) and is the largest stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) provider, serving 6.9 million members in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The company’s total membership is 28.6 million. Centene’s competitive advantages include its local approach with tailored programs, strong provider networks, expertise in serving low-income and complex populations, and a partnership-driven model rather than provider ownership. The company competes effectively on quality, network size, product diversity, and local presence, and is well-positioned for future growth in dual-eligible integration and ICHRA-driven commercial market disruption. While the company faces intense competition from other MCOs and non-traditional entrants, it maintains leadership positions in Medicaid and Marketplace segments and an established presence in Medicare. Specific market share percentages are not provided, but Centene’s status as the largest Medicaid and Marketplace carrier and largest stand-alone PDP provider indicates a leading market share in these segments. | Centene is a market leader in its key segments. As of December 31, 2023, Centene was the largest Medicaid health insurer in the United States, serving more than 14 million Medicaid recipients in 30 states, and the largest Marketplace (ACA exchange) carrier, serving 3.9 million members across 28 states under the Ambetter Health brand. The company also served 1.3 million Medicare Advantage members across 36 states (primarily under the Wellcare brand) and 4.6 million Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) members in all 50 states and DC. Centene's total membership was 27.5 million as of year-end 2023. The company attributes its leadership to the 'power of incumbency' in Medicaid, a local approach to care, and strong partnerships with providers. Centene competes effectively on the basis of provider network size and quality, benefit design, service quality, and local market presence. In the Commercial segment, Centene experienced 88% membership growth in the Marketplace business in 2023, driven by strong product positioning and market growth. The company is recognized for its ability to address complex, low-income populations and has a competitive advantage in value-based provider arrangements and local market customization. While Centene is the market leader in Medicaid and Marketplace, it is a significant but not leading player in Medicare Advantage, with a focus on lower-income, complex members. The company faces intense competition from other MCOs and non-traditional entrants, but maintains a strong competitive position due to its scale, local expertise, and government relationships. Specific market share percentages are not provided, but Centene's status as the largest Medicaid and Marketplace carrier is explicitly stated. |


# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Centene operates in a highly competitive, dynamic, and rapidly evolving healthcare industry subject to significant changes such as business consolidations, new strategic alliances, market pressures, and regulatory reforms. Competition arises from other managed care organizations (MCOs), specialty companies, non-traditional competitors, and traditional state Medicaid programs. Key competitive factors include quality and access to care, provider networks, pricing, service quality, financial stability, and product diversity. Industry shifts, including mergers, new entrants, and technological innovations like artificial intelligence, may alter market dynamics and adversely affect Centene's ability to compete, attract, or retain members and providers. Demand volatility is influenced by factors such as changes in eligibility for premium tax credits, broker distribution channels, and program integrity initiatives. Failure to adapt to these market conditions could negatively impact business results. Additionally, the Health Insurance Marketplace and Medicare Advantage products face pricing and demand uncertainties, with risks from inaccurate pricing, adverse selection, and competitive pressures potentially affecting revenue and profitability. | Centene operates in a highly competitive, dynamic, and rapidly evolving healthcare industry subject to significant changes including business consolidations, new strategic alliances, market pressures, and regulatory reforms at federal and state levels. Competition arises from other managed care organizations (MCOs), specialty companies, non-traditional competitors, and traditional state Medicaid programs. Key competitive factors include quality of care, financial condition, provider network size and quality, pricing, customer service, and market presence. Industry consolidation and new market entrants may intensify competition, potentially limiting Centene's ability to increase market penetration, retain members and providers, and maintain revenue growth and pricing flexibility. Changes in healthcare practices, new technologies, and advances in medicine also pose risks. Additionally, economic conditions such as inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events may impact market conditions. The company faces risks related to demand volatility, including the impact of Medicaid redeterminations and changes in broker distribution channels. Failure to adapt to industry shifts could adversely affect Centene's competitive position and business results. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include challenges in accurately estimating and managing medical expenses and administrative costs, which are critical due to narrow margins. Factors beyond control such as healthcare regulations, utilization rates, provider fraud, natural disasters, pandemics, and economic conditions can impact cost management. The company faces risks from ineffective state-operated systems and subcontractors affecting enrollment and eligibility accuracy. Integration and management of information systems and networks are vital; failures or disruptions, including those caused by cyber-attacks or third-party vendor issues, could materially affect operations. The use of artificial intelligence introduces risks related to accuracy, bias, and cybersecurity. Dependence on third-party vendors for services like pharmacy benefit management exposes Centene to risks of non-compliance, operational failures, and reputational harm. Attracting, retaining, and managing key personnel amid competitive labor markets and hybrid work challenges also pose operational risks. Additionally, failures or breaches in operational or security systems, including those of third-party vendors, could materially harm the business. | Operational risks include challenges in business operations such as integration and management of information systems and networks, reliance on third-party vendors and subcontractors, and potential disruptions from natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or other external events. Failure of vendors to meet contractual obligations or comply with laws can lead to reputational harm, litigation, regulatory action, and operational disruptions. Cybersecurity risks are significant, with threats from external hackers, internal breaches, and vulnerabilities in third-party systems potentially leading to unauthorized access or data breaches. Centene maintains a comprehensive cybersecurity risk management program with policies, training, monitoring, and incident response plans, but cannot eliminate all risks. The company also faces risks related to attracting, retaining, and managing key personnel amid intense competition and evolving work environments.
