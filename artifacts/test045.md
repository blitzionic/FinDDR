# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |

Geographically, U.S. revenue decreased from $144,840 million in 2022 to $140,083 million in 2023, then rebounded to $147,007 million in 2024, while revenue outside the U.S. remained stable ($12,563 million in 2022, $12,586 million in 2023, $12,507 million in 2024). |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined each year, from 15.27% in 2022 to 14.21% in 2023 and 13.49% in 2024, indicating pressure on operating efficiency. Operating income fell from $24,039 million in 2022 to $21,689 million in 2023 and $21,526 million in 2024, despite revenue growth in 2024, suggesting rising costs. Operating expenses increased from $28,739 million in 2022 to $29,271 million in 2023 and further to $31,782 million in 2024, reflecting cost management challenges. The gap between operating income and revenue widened, with operating income as a percentage of revenue dropping from 15.27% in 2022 to 13.49% in 2024. |

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. demonstrated a significant strengthening of its balance sheet. Total assets increased to $96,119 million from $76,530 million in 2023, driven primarily by a substantial rise in non-current assets (from $46,755 million to $64,436 million). Total liabilities also rose to $89,479 million (2023: $75,486 million), with both current and non-current liabilities increasing. Notably, shareholders' equity expanded markedly to $6,640 million from $1,044 million, indicating improved capitalization and a healthier capital structure. The current ratio declined to 110.54% (2023: 135.25%), suggesting reduced short-term liquidity, but it remains above 100%, indicating current assets still cover current liabilities. Debt to equity dropped sharply to 1,347.58% from an extremely high 7,230.46% in 2023, reflecting a more balanced leverage profile, though leverage remains high. Retained earnings increased to $89,533 million (2023: $83,656 million), supporting equity growth. Overall, the company’s financial health improved in terms of equity and asset base, but liquidity and leverage require ongoing monitoring. | In 2023, The Home Depot, Inc. reported total assets of $76,530 million and total liabilities of $75,486 million, resulting in a very low shareholders' equity of $1,044 million. The current assets stood at $29,775 million against current liabilities of $22,015 million, yielding a current ratio of 135.25%, which indicates adequate short-term liquidity. However, the capital structure is highly leveraged, as evidenced by a debt to equity ratio of 7,230.46%, reflecting a significant reliance on debt financing. Retained earnings increased to $83,656 million, suggesting continued profitability over time. The company’s balance sheet shows a heavy tilt toward liabilities, which, while manageable in the short term, could pose long-term risks if not supported by strong cash flows and earnings. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 showed mixed trends. Revenue grew to $159,514 million (2023: $152,669 million), and gross profit increased to $53,308 million (2023: $50,960 million). Gross margin was stable at 33.42% (2023: 33.38%). However, operating income slightly decreased to $21,526 million (2023: $21,689 million), and net profit declined to $14,806 million (2023: $15,143 million). Operating margin fell to 13.49% (2023: 14.21%), and net profit margin decreased to 9.28% (2023: 9.92%), indicating higher operating expenses and interest costs. Return on equity was exceptionally high at 385.37%, reflecting strong earnings relative to equity, while return on assets was robust at 17.15%. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 23.70% (2023: 24.00%). Overall, while top-line growth was solid and margins remained healthy, increased expenses and interest costs pressured bottom-line profitability. | Profitability declined in 2023 compared to 2022. Revenue decreased from $157,403 million to $152,669 million. Gross profit fell from $52,778 million to $50,960 million, and net profit dropped from $17,105 million to $15,143 million. Margins also compressed: gross margin slightly decreased from 33.53% to 33.38%, operating margin from 15.27% to 14.21%, and net profit margin from 10.87% to 9.92%. The effective tax rate remained stable at 24.00% (vs. 23.90% in 2022). Return on equity and return on assets were not provided. Overall, the company remained profitable, but the downward trend in revenue and margins signals some pressure on earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 was characterized by both strengths and challenges. Asset turnover was strong at 184.78%, indicating effective use of assets to generate revenue. Inventory increased to $23,451 million (2023: $20,976 million), which may reflect higher sales or potential inventory buildup. Net cash from operations decreased to $19,810 million (2023: $21,172 million), suggesting some pressure on cash generation. Operating expenses rose to $31,782 million (2023: $29,271 million), impacting operating income. Net cash from investing was significantly more negative at $(21,031) million (2023: $(4,729) million), indicating increased investment activity. Net cash from financing was less negative at $(694) million (2023: $(15,443) million), reflecting reduced outflows, possibly due to lower debt repayments or share repurchases. The net decrease in cash was $(1,915) million (2023: increase of $1,000 million). Dividend payments increased to $(8,929) million (2023: $(8,383) million), showing a continued commitment to shareholder returns. Overall, the company maintained efficient asset utilization but faced higher costs and lower operating cash flow. | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased in line with revenue, but operating expenses increased from $28,739 million to $29,271 million, indicating some cost pressure. Net cash from operations improved significantly from $14,615 million in 2022 to $21,172 million in 2023, suggesting better cash conversion and working capital management. Inventory at year-end was $20,976 million. Despite lower earnings, the company generated higher operating cash flow, which is a positive sign for operational efficiency. However, the lack of asset turnover data limits a full assessment of asset utilization. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Key financial risks in 2024 include elevated leverage and reduced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio, while much improved, remains high at 1,347.58%, indicating significant reliance on debt financing. The current ratio declined to 110.54%, suggesting tighter liquidity and a reduced buffer for meeting short-term obligations. Interest expense increased to $2,321 million (2023: $1,943 million), and interest coverage fell to 927.45% (2023: 1,116.26%), though coverage remains strong. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, but no material tax risk is evident. The substantial increase in non-current liabilities and investment outflows may signal higher long-term obligations and potential exposure to investment risk. The net decrease in cash also warrants attention. Overall, while the company’s risk profile improved in terms of equity and interest coverage, high leverage and lower liquidity are early warning indicators that should be closely monitored. | The company’s financial risk profile in 2023 is characterized by high leverage, as shown by the debt to equity ratio of 7,230.46%. While the current ratio of 135.25% indicates sufficient liquidity to cover short-term obligations, the low equity base increases vulnerability to earnings volatility. Interest expense rose from $1,617 million to $1,943 million, and interest coverage declined from 1,486.64% to 1,116.26%, though it remains at a comfortable level. The effective tax rate was stable. The high leverage and declining margins are early warning signs that warrant close monitoring, especially if profitability continues to decline. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, The Home Depot, Inc. appears to be investing heavily in its future, as evidenced by the significant increase in net cash used for investing activities ($(21,031) million in 2024 vs. $(4,729) million in 2023). This may support future growth, particularly given the increase in non-current assets. The company’s ability to sustain dividends, with payments rising to $(8,929) million, suggests confidence in ongoing cash flow generation. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the U.S. market (2024: $147,007 million vs. $140,083 million in 2023), while international revenue was stable. By product, Hardlines and Décor saw modest increases, and a new 'Other' category contributed $6,406 million, indicating potential diversification. However, the decline in net cash from operations and the net decrease in cash highlight the need for careful cash flow management. If investment yields expected returns, future performance could strengthen, but ongoing high leverage and lower liquidity may constrain flexibility. Continued focus on operational efficiency and prudent capital allocation will be critical for sustaining growth and shareholder returns. | Investment activity increased, as net cash used in investing rose from $(3,140) million to $(4,729) million. Net cash used in financing also increased, primarily due to higher dividend payments ($8,383 million in 2023 vs. $7,789 million in 2022) and other financing outflows. Despite these outflows, the company generated a net increase in cash of $1,000 million, supported by strong operating cash flow. Revenue by product and region declined or remained flat, with U.S. revenue falling from $144,840 million to $140,083 million and international revenue nearly flat. The sustainability of cash flows and dividend policy appears solid for now, but future performance may be challenged if revenue and margin pressures persist, especially given the high leverage and limited equity cushion. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Home Depot faces significant market risks including intense competition from a wide range of retailers (brick-and-mortar, multichannel, online), specialty stores, and service providers. The internet increases competitive entry and price transparency. Customer demand is subject to seasonal influences and economic conditions, including housing market stability, GDP changes, inflation, interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical events. Inflation and deflation in commodity prices, such as lumber and raw materials, can impact prices, demand, sales, and profit margins. Failure to respond to changing customer preferences, expectations, and trends, including sustainability concerns and delivery options, could adversely affect market share and financial performance.
