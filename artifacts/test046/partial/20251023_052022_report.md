| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue increased steadily from USD 12,293,368 thousand in 2022 to USD 12,368,198 thousand in 2023 and further to USD 12,984,399 thousand in 2024. Despite this growth, gross profit declined from USD 4,711,886 thousand in 2022 to USD 4,284,558 thousand in 2023, before recovering to USD 4,533,735 thousand in 2024. Gross margin decreased from 38.33% in 2022 to 34.64% in 2023, with a slight improvement to 34.92% in 2024. By product, Hardlines revenue declined from USD 4,952.2 thousand in 2022 to USD 4,899.3 thousand in 2024, while Apparel increased from USD 4,218.1 thousand to USD 4,425.4 thousand, and Footwear grew significantly from USD 2,979.1 thousand to USD 3,829.0 thousand over the same period.

| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined consistently from 16.55% in 2022 to 11.83% in 2023 and further to 9.88% in 2024, indicating reduced operating efficiency. Operating income fell from USD 2,034,503 thousand in 2022 to USD 1,463,019 thousand in 2023 and then to USD 1,282,365 thousand in 2024, even as revenue increased each year. Operating expenses rose from USD 2,677,383 thousand in 2022 to USD 2,821,539 thousand in 2023 and sharply to USD 3,251,370 thousand in 2024, suggesting that cost management has not kept pace with revenue growth, pressuring profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 23.79% in 2022 to 24.62% in 2023, then dropped significantly to 20.61% in 2024, which helped support net profit in 2024 despite lower operating income.

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. demonstrated a stable financial position with total assets increasing to 9,311,752 (thousands USD) from 8,992,196 in 2023. Shareholders' equity rose to 2,617,281, and retained earnings increased significantly to 5,588,914, indicating strong profit retention. Total liabilities also increased to 6,694,471, with both current and non-current liabilities rising. The current ratio declined to 177.67% from 187.90%, reflecting a slight reduction in short-term liquidity but still indicating coverage of current liabilities by current assets. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at 255.78%, suggesting a consistent capital structure with high leverage. Overall, the company maintained a solid asset base and equity growth, though liquidity and leverage levels warrant ongoing monitoring. | In 2023, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. reported total assets of $8,992,196 thousand and total liabilities of $6,467,573 thousand, resulting in shareholders' equity of $2,524,623 thousand. The current assets stood at $4,963,186 thousand versus current liabilities of $2,641,446 thousand, yielding a strong current ratio of 187.90%, indicating robust short-term liquidity. The company’s capital structure is highly leveraged, as evidenced by a debt to equity ratio of 256.18%, suggesting a significant reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Retained earnings increased to $4,878,404 thousand, reflecting cumulative profitability. Inventory levels were $2,830,917 thousand, a substantial component of current assets. Overall, the balance sheet shows solid liquidity but a high degree of financial leverage. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 showed mixed trends. Revenue grew to 12,984,399 from 12,368,198, and gross profit increased to 4,533,735. The gross margin improved slightly to 34.92%. However, operating income declined to 1,282,365, and the operating margin fell to 9.88% from 11.83%, reflecting higher operating expenses (3,251,370 vs. 2,821,539). Net profit was nearly flat at 1,046,519, with the net margin decreasing to 8.06%. Return on equity and assets were low at 0.04% and 0.01%, respectively, indicating modest returns relative to the balance sheet. The effective tax rate dropped to 20.61%, supporting net profit stability. Overall, while top-line growth and gross margin improved, higher expenses compressed operating and net margins, and returns on capital were subdued. | Profitability declined in 2023 compared to 2022. Revenue was relatively flat, increasing slightly from $12,293,368 thousand to $12,368,198 thousand. However, gross profit fell from $4,711,886 thousand to $4,284,558 thousand, and all key margins deteriorated: gross margin dropped from 38.33% to 34.64%, operating margin from 16.55% to 11.83%, and net profit margin from 12.36% to 8.43%. Operating income decreased from $2,034,503 thousand to $1,463,019 thousand, and net profit declined from $1,519,871 thousand to $1,043,138 thousand. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 24.62%. The data indicates margin compression and lower earnings quality, with profitability under pressure despite stable top-line performance. Return on equity and assets were not reported. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 was characterized by improved cash generation and asset utilization. Net cash from operations surged to 1,527,335 from 921,881, indicating stronger cash conversion from earnings. Asset turnover was 0.14, suggesting moderate efficiency in using assets to generate sales. Inventory levels were stable (2,848,797 vs. 2,830,917), and working capital management remained effective despite a slight decrease in the current ratio. Operating expenses increased, impacting operating income, but the company managed to generate higher cash flows. Net cash used in investing rose to (614,676), reflecting increased investment activity, while net cash used in financing decreased to (1,035,748), possibly due to lower debt repayments or share repurchases. The net decrease in cash was reduced to (123,166), indicating improved cash flow management. | Operational efficiency weakened in 2023. Cost of goods sold increased by $502,158 thousand, outpacing the modest revenue growth, which led to a lower gross margin. Operating expenses also rose from $2,677,383 thousand to $2,821,539 thousand, further pressuring operating income. Net cash from operations dropped significantly from $1,616,872 thousand in 2022 to $921,881 thousand in 2023, indicating reduced cash generation from core activities. Working capital appears healthy given the current ratio, but the decline in operating cash flow and the increase in inventories may signal less efficient asset utilization. Net cash used in investing increased slightly, while net cash used in financing activities rose sharply, primarily due to higher outflows, including dividends and possibly debt repayments. The net decrease in cash of $718,819 thousand contrasts with a net increase in 2022, highlighting weaker cash flow dynamics. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 were mixed. The current ratio declined but remained above 1, suggesting adequate liquidity. The debt to equity ratio was stable at a high 255.78%, indicating significant leverage. Interest expense decreased to 58,023, and interest coverage improved markedly to 2,210.10%, reducing short-term solvency risk. The effective tax rate fell to 20.61%, which may reflect favorable tax developments. No geographic revenue breakdown was available, limiting risk assessment from a diversification perspective. Overall, while leverage remains high, strong interest coverage and liquidity mitigate immediate financial risk, but ongoing monitoring of debt levels is recommended. | Financial risk increased in 2023. The debt to equity ratio of 256.18% reflects high leverage, raising concerns about long-term solvency. Interest expense rose from $57,839 thousand to $95,220 thousand, and interest coverage fell from 3,517.53% to 1,536.46%, though still at a comfortable level. The current ratio of 187.90% suggests low short-term liquidity risk. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 24.62%. The sharp increase in net cash outflows from financing activities and the significant decrease in cash on hand may indicate increased financial risk if these trends persist. No data is available for asset turnover or returns on equity/assets, limiting further risk assessment. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. appears positioned for continued stability. Increased net cash from operations and higher retained earnings support future investment and dividend capacity. The company increased dividends paid to (351,201), signaling confidence in cash flow sustainability. Net cash used in investing rose, suggesting ongoing capital investments that could drive future growth. Revenue growth was led by footwear (up to 3,829.0 from 3,388.7), while hardlines and other categories were flat or declined, indicating potential for segmental shifts. The absence of geographic data limits regional outlooks. Overall, sustained operational cash flow, investment activity, and a stable capital structure support a cautiously optimistic outlook, though margin pressures and high leverage should be monitored. | Future performance will depend on the company’s ability to restore profitability and manage leverage. Investment activity remained stable, with net cash used in investing at $(392,894) thousand, suggesting ongoing capital expenditures. The sharp reduction in dividends paid (from $(602,964) thousand to $(163,081) thousand) may indicate a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. The sustainability of cash flows is a concern, given the significant drop in operating cash flow and the net decrease in cash. Revenue by product shows growth in Apparel and Footwear, with Hardlines slightly down, indicating potential for segmental shifts. No geographic data is available. The company’s high leverage and declining margins suggest that future financial performance will hinge on improving operational efficiency, margin recovery, and prudent capital management. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | DICK'S Sporting Goods faces market risks from macroeconomic conditions that may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, including inflation, elevated interest rates, recessionary pressures, changes in disposable income, geopolitical conflicts, pandemics, and consumer confidence. Intense competition in the sporting goods industry from various retail formats and online competitors, as well as technological developments such as AI and machine learning, pose risks to growth and profitability. Consumer ability to compare prices in real-time increases pricing pressure. Changes in consumer demand and shopping patterns, including shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, also present risks. Seasonality and weather conditions impact sales, with poor performance during key quarters potentially affecting annual results. Additionally, poor performance or disruptions in professional sports teams and leagues can affect sales of related merchandise. | The Company faces market risks from macroeconomic conditions that may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, including inflation, elevated interest rates, recessionary pressures, geopolitical conflicts, pandemics, and changes in consumer confidence and disposable income. Intense competition in the fragmented sporting goods industry from various retail formats and online competitors, as well as technological developments such as AI and machine learning, pose risks to growth and profitability. Consumer ability to compare prices and product offerings in real-time increases pressure to maintain competitive pricing and assortments. Changes in consumer demand, shopping patterns, and preferences, including shifts toward athletic apparel and athleisure, also present risks. Seasonality and weather-related risks, including unseasonable weather and extreme weather events, can materially affect sales and operating results. Poor performance of professional sports teams, league disruptions, or scandals involving athletes may negatively impact sales of professional sports merchandise. Additionally, anti-ESG and anti-DEI sentiment and related policies could result in compliance obligations, litigation, reputational harm, or loss of consumer demand. The Company’s real estate strategy execution risks, including locating desirable properties and negotiating favorable lease terms, also impact financial results. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include supply chain disruptions due to inflationary pressures, fuel price uncertainty, labor shortages, geopolitical conflicts, port congestion, and natural disasters, which can increase product costs and delay deliveries. Dependence on third-party transportation providers and international manufacturing exposes the company to risks of shipment delays, increased costs, and political instability. Inventory shrinkage due to theft or damage has increased, adversely affecting results.

Inflation may impact the company's ability to maintain gross margins if selling prices do not keep pace. Additionally, inventory shrink due to theft and damage has increased, affecting merchandise margins. The company also faces risks from seasonal fluctuations, unseasonable weather, and natural disasters potentially disrupting operations and consumer demand. Changes in tax laws and regulations, including the Inflation Reduction Act and global tax initiatives, add further uncertainty.
