# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. experienced a consistent decline in revenue over the period, with revenue decreasing from 563,011 (USD, thousands) in 2022 to 535,286 in 2023 and further to 515,561 in 2024. Despite this, gross margin remained relatively stable, moving from 65.95% in 2022 to 65.04% in 2023 and slightly improving to 66.03% in 2024, indicating effective management of direct costs relative to revenue. By product/service, Malls consistently generated the majority of revenue but declined from $495,736 in 2022 to $468,138 in 2023 and $446,043 in 2024, while Outlet Centers and Open-Air Centers showed modest growth (Outlet Centers: $30,356 in 2022 to $34,688 in 2024; Open-Air Centers: $66,821 in 2022 to $69,924 in 2024). By geographic region, the Southeastern United States remained the largest contributor, accounting for 50.3% of total pro-rata share of revenues in 2024 and 51.2% in 2023, with the Midwestern United States contributing 21.8% in 2024 and 22.3% in 2023. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a slight downward trend, from 18.66% in 2022 to 17.87% in 2023, before recovering to 18.12% in 2024. Operating income followed a similar pattern, declining from 105,066 (USD, thousands) in 2022 to 95,665 in 2023 and 93,429 in 2024, while revenue also declined over the same period. Operating expenses were reduced from 266,215 in 2022 to 252,482 in 2023 and further to 246,983 in 2024, reflecting ongoing cost management efforts that helped stabilize margins despite falling revenues. The company’s ability to maintain gross and operating margins in the face of declining revenue suggests disciplined cost control and operational efficiency. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate fluctuated significantly, moving from (3.19%) in 2022 to 21.82% in 2023 and dropping sharply to 1.81% in 2024. This volatility in tax expense (2022: 3,079; 2023: 894; 2024: 1,055) had a pronounced impact on net profit, with net profit swinging from a loss of (99,515) in 2022 to a modest profit of 3,204 in 2023 and a substantial profit of 57,117 in 2024. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. demonstrated an increase in total assets to 2,747,191 (thousands USD) from 2,405,905 in 2023, indicating asset growth. Total liabilities also rose to 2,434,327 from 2,075,288, outpacing asset growth and resulting in a decrease in shareholders' equity to 323,546 from 339,321. The debt to equity ratio increased significantly to 752.39% from 611.60%, highlighting a more leveraged capital structure and greater reliance on debt financing. Retained earnings remain negative, though the deficit narrowed to (371,833) from (380,446), reflecting improved profitability but an ongoing accumulated loss. Liquidity ratios such as current ratio are unavailable, limiting assessment of short-term liquidity. Overall, while asset growth and improved retained earnings are positive, the rising leverage and declining equity base signal increased financial risk. | In 2023, CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. demonstrated a moderate improvement in its financial health. Total assets decreased to $2,405,905 thousand from $2,678,243 thousand in 2022, while total liabilities also declined to $2,075,288 thousand from $2,311,114 thousand. Shareholders' equity fell to $339,321 thousand from $370,541 thousand, indicating a reduction in the equity base. The debt to equity ratio improved slightly to 611.60% from 623.71%, but remains very high, reflecting a highly leveraged capital structure. Retained earnings became more negative, moving from $(338,934) thousand to $(380,446) thousand, suggesting continued historical losses. Liquidity metrics such as current ratio are unavailable, limiting assessment of short-term liquidity. Overall, while leverage remains a significant concern, the reduction in both assets and liabilities points to some deleveraging, and the company returned to positive net profit in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved markedly in 2024. Revenue declined to 515,561 from 535,286, but cost of goods sold also decreased, resulting in a slightly higher gross margin of 66.03% (up from 65.04%). Operating margin improved to 18.12% from 17.87%. Most notably, net profit surged to 57,117 from 3,204, driving net profit margin up to 11.08% from 0.60%. Return on equity (ROE) rose sharply to 17.23% from 0.90%, and return on assets (ROA) increased to 2.22% from 0.13%, reflecting much stronger earnings generation relative to both equity and assets. The effective tax rate dropped significantly to 1.81% from 21.82%, contributing to the net profit increase. Overall, earnings quality improved, with higher margins and returns despite lower revenue. | Profitability improved markedly in 2023. Revenue declined to $535,286 thousand from $563,011 thousand, but net profit turned positive at $3,204 thousand compared to a net loss of $(99,515) thousand in 2022. Gross margin remained stable at 65.04% (2022: 65.95%), and operating margin was 17.87% (2022: 18.66%), indicating consistent cost control at the gross and operating levels. Net profit margin improved significantly to 0.60% from (17.68%), reflecting a return to profitability. Return on equity was 0.90% and return on assets was 0.13%, both modest but positive. The effective tax rate normalized to 21.82% from a negative rate in 2022, and interest expense decreased substantially. Overall, earnings quality improved, with the company achieving positive margins and returns, though absolute profitability remains low. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2024. Operating expenses decreased to 246,983 from 252,482, indicating cost control. Asset turnover declined slightly to 20.01% from 21.06%, suggesting marginally less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased to 202,223 from 183,516, supporting strong cash generation from core activities. Net cash from investing rose significantly to 65,006 from 1,701, indicating increased investment activity. Net cash from financing was more negative at (236,501) versus (204,090), reflecting higher outflows, possibly due to debt repayments or dividend payments. The net increase in cash was positive at 30,728, reversing the prior year's decrease of (16,873). Dividends paid decreased to (50,357) from (116,093), indicating a more conservative dividend policy. Overall, the company improved cost control and cash generation, but asset utilization efficiency declined slightly. | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased to $187,139 thousand from $191,730 thousand, and operating expenses fell to $252,482 thousand from $266,215 thousand, indicating effective cost management. Asset turnover was 21.06%, but without prior year data, trend analysis is limited. Net cash from operations was $183,516 thousand, down from $208,234 thousand, suggesting slightly reduced cash generation from core activities. Net cash from investing was positive at $1,701 thousand, a significant improvement from $(156,685) thousand, indicating reduced capital outflows or asset sales. Net cash from financing was more negative at $(204,090) thousand (2022: $(145,798) thousand), reflecting higher outflows, likely due to increased dividends ($116,093 thousand vs. $23,873 thousand in 2022). The net decrease in cash was $(16,873) thousand, an improvement over 2022. Overall, the company managed costs well and improved investing cash flows, but operational cash generation declined and financing outflows increased. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk increased in 2024. The debt to equity ratio rose to 752.39%, indicating higher leverage and greater financial risk. Interest expense decreased to 154,486 from 172,905, and interest coverage improved to 60.48% from 55.33%, but remains low, suggesting limited buffer to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate dropped sharply to 1.81%, which may not be sustainable and could revert, impacting future net income. The negative retained earnings, though improved, still indicate an accumulated deficit. Liquidity ratios are unavailable, limiting assessment of short-term risk. The increased reliance on debt and thin interest coverage are early warning signs of heightened financial risk. | Financial risk remains elevated in 2023. The debt to equity ratio, while slightly improved, is still extremely high at 611.60%, indicating significant leverage. Interest coverage improved to 55.33% from 48.34%, but remains low, suggesting ongoing vulnerability to interest rate increases or earnings volatility. The effective tax rate normalized to 21.82%, removing the prior year's anomaly. The company paid out substantially higher dividends, which, combined with negative retained earnings and high leverage, could strain future liquidity. Liquidity ratios are unavailable, limiting assessment of short-term risk. The reduction in interest expense and liabilities is positive, but the capital structure remains risky, and the company is exposed to refinancing and cash flow risks. |
| Future financial performance projection | Future performance will depend on the sustainability of recent profitability improvements and the company's ability to manage its high leverage. Increased net cash from investing suggests active investment, potentially supporting future growth. The reduction in dividends paid indicates a more cautious approach to capital allocation, possibly to preserve cash. Cash flow from operations remains strong, supporting ongoing operations and debt servicing. Revenue by product/service shows a decline in malls and lifestyle centers, but growth in outlet and open-air centers, suggesting a potential shift in segment focus. Geographically, the Southeastern and Midwestern U.S. remain the largest contributors, with minor shifts in regional revenue shares. Continued high leverage and low equity base pose risks if profitability or cash flow weakens. The company’s ability to sustain improved margins and manage debt will be critical for future stability and growth. | Looking ahead, CBL & Associates Properties, Inc.'s future performance will depend on its ability to sustain positive earnings and manage its high leverage. The sharp increase in dividends in 2023 may not be sustainable given modest net profit and negative retained earnings. The positive net cash from investing suggests limited new investment or asset sales, which could constrain future growth. Revenue concentration in the Southeastern United States (51.2%) and other specific regions may expose the company to geographic risks. The stabilization of margins and return to profitability are encouraging, but ongoing deleveraging and prudent capital allocation will be critical. Unless revenue growth resumes and leverage is further reduced, financial flexibility may remain constrained. |

The company’s portfolio includes 45 malls, 27 open-air centers, 5 outlet centers, 5 lifestyle centers, and 5 other properties.

The company’s top 25 tenants accounted for 33.28% of total revenues, with no single tenant exceeding 2.72%. CBL faces significant competition from other shopping facilities, online retail, and large real estate investors, and acknowledges that its relative size may limit its ability to invest in technology compared to larger REITs. The company is not identified as a market leader on a national scale but maintains a strong or dominant position in its local and regional markets, especially where its properties are the primary or only major retail centers.

There is no specific market share percentage or national ranking provided in the report. The company’s competitive advantages include its dominant locations in mid-tier markets, a diverse property portfolio, and active asset management and redevelopment strategies. However, CBL’s market position is challenged by evolving consumer habits, the rise of e-commerce, and competition for both tenants and investment opportunities. Overall, CBL is best characterized as a regional player with strong positions in its core markets but not a national market leader. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. faces significant economic challenges including risks from inflation, recession, and volatility in capital and credit markets. Inflation has increased operating expenses, construction costs, and borrowing costs, potentially reducing net operating income and profitability if rent increases do not keep pace. Economic recessions could lead to decreased consumer spending, impacting tenant sales and their ability to meet lease obligations, which in turn could reduce rental revenues and property values. Volatility in capital and credit markets may disrupt access to financing needed for growth and debt service, while rising interest rates increase borrowing costs and may reduce stock price due to investor yield preferences. The company is also exposed to regional economic conditions, particularly in the southeastern and midwestern U.S., where most properties are located. Additional economic uncertainties include increased operating costs (repairs, taxes, utilities, insurance), potential delays and cost overruns in development projects, adverse changes in consumer confidence and spending patterns, and risks from public health emergencies that could reduce customer traffic and tenant viability. These factors collectively could materially and adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. | CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. faces significant economic challenges including the risk of economic recession which could cause extreme volatility and disruption in capital and credit markets, leading to decreased consumer spending and reduced tenant revenues. Inflationary pressures have increased operating expenses, construction costs, and borrowing costs, potentially reducing profitability. The company is exposed to rising interest rates which increase borrowing costs and may reduce stock price. Access to capital and credit markets may be disrupted, impairing the ability to refinance debt or obtain new financing. Regional economic conditions, particularly in the southeastern and midwestern U.S. where most properties are located, heavily influence performance. The COVID-19 pandemic and potential future public health emergencies pose risks to tenant operations, consumer traffic, and leasing activities. Additional economic uncertainties include increased operating costs, tenant bankruptcies, and adverse changes in consumer confidence and spending patterns. Inflation may outpace scheduled rent increases, negatively impacting net operating income. The illiquidity of real estate investments limits the company's ability to respond quickly to adverse economic changes. Social unrest, acts of violence, and terrorism could also negatively affect consumer confidence and spending, thereby impacting revenues and property values. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. operates in a highly competitive environment facing pressures from numerous shopping facilities competing to attract retailers, as well as competition from alternative retail channels such as online shopping, discount and outlet centers, wholesale clubs, direct mail, and television shopping networks. The company must aggressively market properties and adapt to evolving retail technologies and omnichannel strategies adopted by tenants. The rise of e-commerce and digital/mobile shopping has shifted consumer behavior, potentially reducing physical store traffic and occupancy rates, and complicating rent collection based on tenant sales. Competition also arises from other major real estate investors, including REITs, investment banks, and private investors with greater financial resources or different investment criteria, intensifying competition for acquisitions, developments, and key tenants. Technological disruption and changing customer-retailer relationships require timely adaptation, but the company's relative size may limit capital available for strategic technology investments, potentially making properties less attractive. Additionally, tenant bankruptcies, store closings, and the decline of traditional department store anchors pose challenges to maintaining occupancy and rental rates. These competitive dynamics could adversely impact revenues, cash available for distribution, and the company's market position. | The company operates in a highly competitive environment facing competition from various shopping facilities for tenant leases and from alternative retail channels including online shopping, discount and outlet centers, wholesale clubs, and television shopping networks. Retailers at CBL's properties increasingly adopt omnichannel strategies, which may reduce in-store sales and impact rent collections based on sales. Emerging technologies and evolving customer-retailer relationships require adaptation, but CBL's relative size may limit investment in strategic technology enhancements, potentially making its malls less attractive. Competition extends to acquiring, developing, or redeveloping retail properties, with other REITs, investment banks, and institutional investors possessing greater financial resources and economies of scale. The shift toward e-commerce accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic challenges the traditional brick-and-mortar model, potentially leading to store closures and reduced occupancy. Tenant bankruptcies, store closings, and the decline of traditional department store anchors further intensify competitive pressures. Co-tenancy and sales-based lease provisions may reduce rental income if occupancy or sales thresholds are not met. The company also faces challenges in replacing anchors and re-tenanting spaces, especially when properties are partially owned by third parties with conflicting interests. Overall, these competitive dynamics could adversely affect revenues, occupancy rates, and the company's market position. |
