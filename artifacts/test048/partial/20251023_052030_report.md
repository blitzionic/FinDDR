# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Energy Transfer LP's revenue decreased from USD 89,876 million in 2022 to USD 78,586 million in 2023, then rebounded to USD 82,671 million in 2024. Gross margin improved each year, rising from 19.63% in 2022 to 22.96% in 2023 and reaching 25.03% in 2024, indicating better cost control or pricing power. By product/service, Crude oil transportation and services was the largest contributor in 2024 at USD 28,539 million, followed by NGL and refined products transportation and services at USD 24,530 million. Notably, Midstream revenue more than doubled from USD 4,114 million in 2022 to USD 11,199 million in 2024, while Intrastate transportation and storage declined from USD 6,954 million in 2022 to USD 3,053 million in 2024. By geographic region, revenue is overwhelmingly from the United States, with USD 7,101 million in 2024 and minimal foreign revenue. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved steadily from 8.61% in 2022 to 10.56% in 2023 and 11.05% in 2024. Operating income increased from USD 7,738 million in 2022 to USD 8,295 million in 2023 and USD 9,138 million in 2024, outpacing the revenue recovery in 2024. Operating expenses rose from USD 5,356 million in 2022 to USD 5,353 million in 2023 and then to USD 6,341 million in 2024, but the increase in gross profit (from USD 17,644 million in 2022 to USD 20,696 million in 2024) more than offset this, reflecting improved cost management and operational leverage. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 3.36% in 2022 to 5.41% in 2023 and 7.61% in 2024, resulting in higher income tax expense (USD 204 million in 2022, USD 303 million in 2023, and USD 541 million in 2024), which partially offset net profit growth. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Energy Transfer LP demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets rising to $125,380 million from $113,698 million in 2023, indicating asset growth. Total liabilities also increased to $78,946 million (from $69,759 million), but shareholders' equity improved to $46,017 million (from $43,939 million), reflecting retained value creation. The current ratio improved slightly to 112.22% (from 110.25%), suggesting a modest enhancement in short-term liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio increased to 171.56% (from 158.76%), indicating a higher reliance on debt financing and a more leveraged capital structure. Non-current assets and liabilities both grew, consistent with ongoing investment and long-term obligations. Overall, the company maintains adequate liquidity and a strong asset base, but the rising leverage warrants monitoring. | In 2023, Energy Transfer LP demonstrated a solid financial position. Total assets increased to $113,698 million from $105,643 million in 2022, reflecting ongoing investment and growth. Total liabilities also rose to $69,759 million (from $64,984 million), but shareholders' equity strengthened to $43,939 million (up from $40,659 million), indicating improved capitalization. The current ratio declined slightly to 110.25% from 116.52%, suggesting a modest reduction in short-term liquidity, but it remains above 100%, indicating current assets still cover current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio was stable at 158.76% (2022: 159.83%), showing a consistent capital structure with significant leverage but no material increase in risk. Overall, the company maintained a balanced approach to asset growth and capital structure, with a slight tightening in liquidity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved across all key metrics in 2024. Revenue increased to $82,671 million (up from $78,586 million), and gross profit rose to $20,696 million (from $18,045 million). Gross margin expanded to 25.03% (from 22.96%), and operating margin increased to 11.05% (from 10.56%), indicating better cost management and pricing power. Net profit climbed to $6,565 million (from $5,294 million), with net profit margin improving to 7.94% (from 6.74%). Return on equity (ROE) rose to 14.60% (from 12.52%), and return on assets (ROA) increased to 5.49% (from 4.83%), both reflecting enhanced earnings quality and efficient capital deployment. The effective tax rate increased to 7.61% (from 5.41%), but this did not materially impact net profitability. Overall, 2024 saw stronger earnings and improved margins. | Profitability in 2023 was mixed. Revenue declined to $78,586 million from $89,876 million, but gross profit increased to $18,045 million (2022: $17,644 million), and operating income rose to $8,295 million (2022: $7,738 million), indicating improved cost management. Gross margin improved to 22.96% (from 19.63%), and operating margin increased to 10.56% (from 8.61%), reflecting better operational efficiency. Net profit margin edged up to 6.74% (2022: 6.53%), despite a decrease in net profit to $5,294 million (from $5,868 million), due to lower revenue. Return on equity was 12.52% and return on assets was 4.83% (2022: N/A), both indicating solid earnings generation relative to capital deployed. The effective tax rate increased to 5.41% (from 3.36%), and interest expense rose, slightly pressuring net results. Overall, earnings quality improved through margin expansion, even as top-line growth softened. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2024. While asset turnover declined to 69.16% (from 71.66%), indicating slightly less efficient use of assets to generate revenue, cost control was effective as evidenced by higher gross and operating margins. Operating expenses increased to $6,341 million (from $5,353 million), but this was offset by higher gross profit. Net cash from operations increased significantly to $11,506 million (from $9,555 million), supporting robust cash generation. Inventories rose to $3,070 million (from $2,478 million), and working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) improved to $1,546 million (from $1,156 million), indicating better liquidity management. Net cash from investing was more negative at $(5,904) million (from $(4,325) million), reflecting increased investment activity. Net cash from financing remained negative at $(5,451) million, consistent with ongoing debt service and dividend payments. Overall, the company maintained strong cash flow and working capital, despite higher investment outflows. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023. Cost of goods sold fell to $60,541 million (2022: $72,232 million), outpacing the revenue decline and supporting higher gross profit. Operating expenses were stable at $5,353 million (2022: $5,356 million), demonstrating effective cost control. Asset turnover was 71.66% (2022: N/A), indicating reasonable utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased to $9,555 million (from $9,051 million), supporting liquidity and ongoing operations. Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was $1,156 million, slightly down from $1,713 million in 2022, reflecting tighter short-term resources. Cash outflows for investing and financing activities increased modestly, and dividends paid rose to $6,057 million (from $4,643 million), indicating a higher return to shareholders. The net decrease in cash was $96 million, similar to the prior year, suggesting stable cash management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk increased moderately in 2024. The debt to equity ratio rose to 171.56%, indicating higher leverage and greater financial risk. Interest expense increased to $3,125 million (from $2,578 million), and interest coverage declined to 292.42% (from 321.76%), though coverage remains strong. The current ratio improved slightly, suggesting stable short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate increased to 7.61%, which could signal higher future tax obligations. The company’s higher leverage and increased interest expense are early warning signs that should be monitored, especially if earnings growth slows. No significant deterioration in liquidity or coverage ratios is evident, but the trend toward higher leverage and investment outflows could elevate risk if not matched by future earnings growth. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 were largely stable. The debt to equity ratio remained high at 158.76% but was nearly unchanged from 2022, indicating continued reliance on leverage. Interest coverage declined slightly to 321.76% (from 335.56%), but remains robust, suggesting the company can comfortably meet interest obligations. The current ratio decreased to 110.25%, reflecting a modest reduction in liquidity buffer. The effective tax rate increased to 5.41% (from 3.36%), which could impact future net income if the trend continues. Rising interest expense (to $2,578 million from $2,306 million) and higher dividend payouts may pressure free cash flow. No significant new risks are evident, but the high leverage and tightening liquidity warrant ongoing monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Future financial performance appears cautiously optimistic. Increased net cash from operations and higher investment outflows suggest ongoing capital projects or acquisitions, which could drive future growth. Dividend payments increased to $6,470 million (from $6,057 million), indicating a continued commitment to shareholder returns, but also placing demands on cash flow. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in NGL and refined products transportation and services ($24,530 million), crude oil transportation and services ($28,539 million), and midstream ($11,199 million), while some segments (e.g., intrastate and interstate transportation) saw declines. Geographic revenue remains overwhelmingly U.S.-focused, with only marginal foreign revenue. Sustained cash flow from operations and a diversified revenue base support future stability, but higher leverage and investment spending require careful management to ensure ongoing dividend sustainability and balance sheet strength. | Looking ahead, Energy Transfer LP's increased investment outflows ($4,325 million in 2023 vs. $4,022 million in 2022) and higher dividends suggest a focus on both growth and shareholder returns. Sustained strong cash flow from operations ($9,555 million) supports ongoing capital expenditures and dividend policy, but the rising payout may limit flexibility if cash generation weakens. Segment data shows a significant increase in midstream revenue ($10,406 million vs. $4,114 million), partially offsetting declines in intrastate transportation and storage. Geographic revenue remains overwhelmingly U.S.-focused. The company’s ability to maintain or grow cash flows, manage leverage, and control costs will be key to future performance. Continued investment in high-growth segments and prudent capital management will be critical for sustaining financial health and supporting future dividends. |
