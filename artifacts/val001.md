| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 was significant, increasing from £17,988,687 to £20,934,837, representing a growth of approximately 10.8%. The growth continued into 2024, with revenue reaching £24,383, indicating a substantial increase. Gross margin has shown a slight decline from 121.11% in 2022 to 120.17% in 2024, suggesting a decrease in profitability per unit sold. Revenue by product/service indicates a strong performance in healthcare services, which grew from £16,360m in 2022 to £23,027m in 2024. Laboratories services saw a slight decrease, while management fees remained stable. Geographic revenue distribution shows growth across all regions, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, with Singapore's revenue increasing from £4,824m in 2022 to £6,304m in 2024. |
