# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 was significant, increasing from RM17,988,687 to RM20,934,837, which represents a growth of approximately 10.8%. The growth continued into 2024, reaching RM24,383, indicating a substantial increase. Gross margin performance showed a slight decline from 128.52% in 2023 to 127.93% in 2024, suggesting a minor decrease in profitability relative to revenue.

The geographic distribution of revenue shows that all regions experienced growth, with Singapore leading at RM6,304m in 2024, up from RM4,912m in 2022, indicating a strong market presence. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin data is not available for the years analyzed. However, the relationship between operating income and revenue cannot be assessed due to missing operating income figures. Cost management appears to be effective as operating expenses increased at a slower rate compared to revenue growth, with operating expenses rising from RM1,259,272 in 2023 to RM13,495 in 2024, indicating a focus on controlling costs despite revenue increases. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 25.80% in 2022 to 15.81% in 2024, which positively impacted net profit margins, increasing from 9.15% in 2022 to 12.97% in 2024. This reduction in the tax rate suggests improved tax efficiency.
