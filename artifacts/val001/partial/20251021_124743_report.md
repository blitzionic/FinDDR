# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue shows a significant decline from 20,934,837 RM in 2023 to 24,383 RM in 2024, indicating a possible data inconsistency or a major business contraction. Despite this, product/service revenue trends from 2022 to 2024 show growth in Healthcare services from 16,359 RM to 23,027 RM, Laboratories services slightly decreased from 1,064.9 RM to 1,032 RM, and Management fees increased from 26.2 RM to 40 RM. Education services revenue dropped sharply from 267.1 RM in 2022 to 57.6 RM in 2023 and is absent in 2024. Geographic revenue distribution shows growth across all regions from 2022 to 2024, with Türkiye and Europe increasing from 4,348 RM to 7,423 RM, Singapore from 4,824 RM to 6,304 RM, Malaysia from 3,045 RM to 4,267 RM, India from 3,175 RM to 4,707 RM, and Greater China from 998.4 RM to 1,528 RM. Gross margin data is unavailable, limiting margin trend analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin data is not provided, restricting direct margin trend analysis. Operating expenses in 2024 total approximately -14,365 RM (sum of -9,241, -1,247, -434, -53, -123, -70, -3,091), compared to a much larger scale in 2023 (-11,010,881 RM total), reflecting the revenue scale difference or data inconsistency. Net profit margin declined from 16.20% in 2023 to 12.97% in 2024, indicating reduced profitability relative to revenue. Operating income figures are missing, preventing detailed analysis of operating income versus revenue. Cost management effectiveness appears challenged given the net profit margin decline and large operating expenses relative to revenue in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | Effective tax rate slightly decreased from 16.26% in 2023 to 15.81% in 2024, marginally improving after-tax profitability. Income tax expense dropped from -658,346 RM in 2023 to -594 RM in 2024, consistent with the revenue and profit scale changes. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors impacting profitability cannot be conclusively identified from the provided data, but the sharp revenue and expense scale changes suggest possible structural or reporting changes affecting financial results. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows an increase in total assets to RM56,759 million from RM50,192 million in 2023, indicating asset growth. Current assets increased slightly from RM6,712 million to RM6,871 million, while non-current assets rose from RM43,479 million to RM49,888 million, reflecting investment in long-term assets. Total liabilities increased from RM17,833 million to RM22,851 million, with current liabilities rising from RM7,457 million to RM9,576 million and non-current liabilities from RM10,377 million to RM13,275 million, indicating higher leverage. Shareholders' equity improved from RM32,359 million to RM33,908 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from RM7,840 million to RM9,708 million, which strengthens the equity base. The current ratio declined from 90.02% to 71.75%, suggesting a reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased from 55.11% to 67.39%, indicating a higher reliance on debt financing. Overall, the balance sheet shows growth in assets and equity but with increased liabilities and a weakening liquidity position. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from RM48,467,487 million in 2022 to RM50,192,160 million, reflecting asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from RM40,185,165 million to RM43,479,250 million. Total liabilities decreased from RM19,308,430 million to RM17,833,510 million, indicating effective liability management. However, current liabilities increased from RM6,600,000 million to RM7,456,817 million, while current assets declined from RM8,282,322 million to RM6,712,910 million, resulting in a lower current ratio of 90.02% in 2023 compared to 125.49% in 2022, suggesting reduced short-term liquidity. Shareholders' equity improved significantly from RM29,159,057 million to RM32,358,650 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from RM6,665,236 million to RM7,840,027 million, strengthening the equity base and capital structure. The debt to equity ratio improved to 55.11% from 66.22%, indicating reduced leverage and a stronger balance sheet. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue for 2024 is RM24,383 million, up from RM20,935 million in 2023, showing top-line growth. However, net profit decreased to RM3,162 million from RM3,391 million, reflecting a decline in profitability. The net profit margin fell from 16.20% in 2023 to 12.97% in 2024, indicating reduced earnings efficiency relative to revenue. Income before taxes decreased from RM4,049 million to RM3,756 million, and income tax expense declined slightly from RM658 million to RM594 million, maintaining a similar effective tax rate around 15.8%. Return on equity dropped sharply from 11.02% to 0.02%, and return on assets declined from 6.87% to 0.01%, signaling a significant deterioration in earnings quality and returns generated on invested capital. Gross and operating margins are unavailable, limiting margin analysis. Overall, while revenue grew, profitability and returns weakened substantially in 2024. | The company reported revenue of RM20,934,837 million in 2023, with no comparable 2022 figure available. Net profit stood at RM3,390,955 million, yielding a net profit margin of 16.20%, which indicates healthy profitability. Income before taxes was RM4,049,301 million, with an effective tax rate of -16.26%, reflecting a tax benefit or credit situation. Interest expense was RM941,319 million, impacting earnings but not preventing solid net profitability. Gross profit and operating income figures are unavailable, limiting margin analysis, but the net margin and return ratios provide insight. Return on equity was 11.02%, and return on assets was 6.87%, indicating reasonable earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets to generate profits. The revenue mix shows growth in healthcare services revenue to RM19,582 million, offset by declines in laboratories and education services, suggesting a concentration in healthcare driving earnings. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses in 2024 totaled approximately RM17,259 million (sum of components: -9241, -1247, -434, -53, -123, -70, -3091), compared to a much larger total in 2023, but direct comparison is limited due to data format differences. Asset turnover declined drastically from 42.44% in 2023 to 0.10% in 2024, indicating a significant drop in how efficiently assets generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased slightly to RM4,285 million from RM3,759 million, showing improved cash generation despite lower profitability. Inventories increased marginally from RM640 million to RM681 million, suggesting stable inventory management. Overall, operational efficiency appears to have worsened in terms of asset utilization, but cash flow from operations remains positive and slightly improved. | Operating expenses aggregated to RM-13,010,295 million (sum of all components), reflecting significant cost outlays. Without gross profit and operating income data, operating margin cannot be precisely calculated, but the net profit margin of 16.20% suggests effective cost control relative to revenue. Asset turnover was exceptionally high at 42.44, indicating very efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased slightly to RM3,759,434 million from RM3,667,643 million in 2022, demonstrating stable cash generation capacity. Inventories increased from RM519,431 million to RM639,837 million, which may require monitoring for inventory management efficiency. Working capital appears constrained given the decline in current assets and increase in current liabilities, which could impact operational liquidity. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased in 2024 as evidenced by the rise in debt to equity ratio from 55.11% to 67.39%, indicating higher financial risk due to greater debt reliance. The current ratio decreased from 90.02% to 71.75%, signaling reduced liquidity and potential short-term solvency concerns. Interest expense increased slightly from RM941 million to RM1,065 million, but interest coverage ratio is unavailable, limiting assessment of the company's ability to service debt. The effective tax rate remained stable around 15.8%, showing no significant tax risk changes. The decline in return ratios and margins alongside increased liabilities suggests elevated financial risk and early warning signs of stress in profitability and liquidity. | Leverage decreased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio falling to 55.11% from 66.22%, reducing financial risk. However, the current ratio declined to 90.02% from 125.49%, indicating potential liquidity pressure in the short term. Interest coverage ratio is unavailable, but interest expense of RM941,319 million against income before taxes of RM4,049,301 million suggests some capacity to cover interest, though exact coverage cannot be confirmed. The negative effective tax rate (-16.26%) may indicate tax credits or deferred tax assets, which could pose future tax risk or benefit. The increase in current liabilities alongside a decrease in current assets warrants attention to short-term obligations. No explicit data on market or currency risks is provided. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a net cash outflow from investing of RM8,247 million in 2024, slightly less than RM936 million outflow in 2023 (note: 2023 figure is negative but smaller in magnitude), indicating continued capital expenditure or acquisitions supporting growth. Net cash from financing turned positive to RM3,033 million from a negative RM3,999 million in 2023, suggesting new financing inflows or debt issuance. Dividends paid decreased to RM881 million from RM1,770 million, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue growth is supported by increases across all geographic regions, notably Türkiye and Europe rising from RM5,674 million to RM7,423 million and Healthcare services revenue increasing from RM19,582 million to RM23,027 million, signaling strong market expansion. Cash flow from operations remains positive and slightly improved, supporting sustainability. Overall, the company appears to be investing for growth with cautious dividend payments and expanding market presence, but profitability challenges may impact future performance. | Investment activities show a reduction in net cash used in investing from RM-1,853,894 million in 2022 to RM-936,291 million in 2023, indicating a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset purchases, which may impact future growth. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow to RM-3,998,581 million from RM-2,919,853 million, driven partly by higher dividends paid (RM1,770,205 million vs RM528,162 million), suggesting a strong dividend policy but potentially less cash retained for reinvestment. Revenue growth in key geographic regions such as Singapore, Malaysia, India, Greater China, and Türkiye and Europe indicates expanding market presence, with healthcare services revenue notably increasing. The stable operational cash flow and increased equity base support sustainable financial performance, but the reduced liquidity and increased dividend payout may constrain flexibility for future investments. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks from geopolitical shifts, regional conflicts, and changes in international trade dynamics that could disrupt business strategies and operations. Prolonged global economic uncertainty, including inflation and energy market disruptions, may increase operational costs. Rising global healthcare costs driven by medical advancements and pressure from insurance payors for price adjustments pose financial challenges. The healthcare industry is also impacted by evolving customer behavior and demand volatility due to an ageing population, increasing chronic diseases, and rapid medical technology advancements.
