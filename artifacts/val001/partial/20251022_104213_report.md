# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | IHH HEALTHCARE BERHAD's revenue shows a strong upward trend from RM17,988,687 million in 2022 to RM20,935 million in 2023, and further to RM24,383 million in 2024, indicating robust growth. Gross margin remains consistently high but slightly declining from 130.56% in 2022 to 130.24% in 2023 and 127.97% in 2024, suggesting stable profitability on direct costs despite minor compression. Revenue by product/service is dominated by Healthcare services, increasing from RM16,359,826 million in 2022 to RM23,027 million in 2024, while Laboratories services show a slight decrease from RM1,064,862 million in 2022 to RM1,032 million in 2024. Management fees remain minimal but stable. Geographically, revenue growth is broad-based with significant increases in Türkiye and Europe from RM4,384,857 million in 2022 to RM7,423 million in 2024, and steady growth in Singapore from RM5,143,114 million to RM6,304 million, reflecting successful regional expansion and diversification. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin exhibits a notable improvement from 12.68% in 2022 to 57.36% in 2023, before declining to 51.36% in 2024, indicating enhanced operational leverage in 2023 with some normalization in 2024. Operating income increased substantially from RM2,281,792 million in 2022 to RM12,008 million in 2023 and RM12,523 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and reflecting improved cost control and operational efficiency. Operating expenses decreased significantly from RM10,210,342 million in 2022 to RM2,596 million in 2023 and RM3,091 million in 2024, demonstrating effective cost management. This reduction in operating expenses relative to revenue growth has driven the improved operating margins, highlighting the company's focus on optimizing operational costs while scaling revenue. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has decreased from 25.80% in 2022 to 16.25% in 2023 and further to 15.81% in 2024, positively impacting net profitability by reducing tax burden. This decline in tax rate corresponds with an increase in net profit margin from 9.15% in 2022 to 16.20% in 2023, though it slightly decreased to 12.97% in 2024, indicating some variability in after-tax profitability. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided financial data, suggesting that the observed profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance and tax efficiency improvements. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, IHH Healthcare Berhad demonstrated growth in total assets, increasing from RM50,192 million in 2023 to RM56,759 million, driven primarily by a rise in non-current assets from RM43,479 million to RM49,888 million. Total liabilities also increased significantly by 28.1% from RM17,833 million to RM22,851 million, with both current liabilities (RM7,456 million to RM9,576 million) and non-current liabilities (RM10,377 million to RM13,275 million) rising. Shareholders' equity grew modestly by 3.5% to RM30,140 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from RM7,840 million to RM9,708 million. The current ratio declined from 90.03% to 71.75%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased from 61.27% to 75.82%, reflecting a higher leverage and a shift towards greater reliance on debt financing. Overall, the company’s financial health shows asset growth and equity strengthening but with increased leverage and reduced liquidity, suggesting a more aggressive capital structure in 2024. | In 2023, IHH Healthcare Berhad demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from RM48,467 million in 2022 to RM50,192 million, reflecting asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from RM40,185 million to RM43,479 million. Total liabilities decreased from RM19,308 million to RM17,833 million, indicating improved liability management. However, current liabilities increased slightly from RM6,601 million to RM7,456 million, while current assets decreased from RM7,358 million to RM6,713 million, resulting in a lower current ratio of 90.03% compared to 111.47% in 2022, suggesting a slight decline in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved significantly from 73.72% to 61.27%, indicating a stronger capital structure with less reliance on debt financing. Shareholders' equity rose from RM26,192 million to RM29,106 million, supported by increased retained earnings from RM6,665 million to RM7,840 million, reflecting retained profitability and reinvestment in the business. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue for 2024 rose substantially by 16.5% to RM24,383 million from RM20,935 million in 2023, driven mainly by healthcare services (RM23,027 million) and growth across all geographic regions, notably Türkiye and Europe increasing from RM5,673 million to RM7,423 million. Gross profit increased by 20.2% to RM17,564 million, though the gross margin slightly declined from 130.24% to 127.97%, indicating marginally higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income improved modestly by 4.3% to RM12,523 million, but the operating margin decreased from 57.36% to 51.36%, reflecting increased operating expenses. Net profit decreased by 6.8% to RM3,162 million, with net profit margin falling from 16.20% to 12.97%. Return on equity declined from 12.26% to 10.67%, and return on assets dropped from 6.87% to 5.91%, indicating reduced earnings efficiency and quality despite revenue growth. The effective tax rate remained stable around 15.8%. Overall, profitability improved in absolute terms but margins and returns weakened, suggesting pressure on cost control and earnings quality. | Revenue for 2023 was RM20,935 million, up from RM17,988.7 million in 2022, showing a positive growth trend. Gross profit increased to RM14,604 million from RM12,491.1 million, maintaining a stable gross margin of 130.24%, slightly lower than 130.56% in 2022. Operating income surged to RM12,008 million from RM2,281.8 million, driving a substantial increase in operating margin to 57.36% from 12.68%, indicating improved operational profitability. Net profit rose to RM3,391 million from RM1,645.1 million, with net profit margin improving to 16.20% from 9.15%, reflecting enhanced earnings quality. Income before taxes increased to RM4,049 million from RM2,217.1 million, while income tax expense decreased proportionally, resulting in a lower effective tax rate of 16.25% compared to 25.80% in 2022. Return on equity and return on assets were reported at 12.26% and 6.87% respectively in 2023, indicating efficient use of equity and assets to generate profits. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, the company showed improved asset utilization with asset turnover increasing from 42.44% to 45.60%, indicating more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Cost of goods sold increased by 7.7% to RM6,819 million, while operating expenses rose by 19% to RM3,091 million, outpacing revenue growth and contributing to margin compression. Inventories increased slightly from RM640 million to RM681 million, consistent with business expansion. Net cash from operations increased from RM3,759 million to RM4,285 million, reflecting stronger cash generation from core activities. However, net cash used in investing activities remained high at RM8,247 million, though slightly lower than the previous year, indicating continued capital expenditure. Working capital pressure is evident from the decline in current ratio and increased current liabilities. Cash flow from financing turned positive to RM3,033 million from a large outflow previously, possibly reflecting new debt or equity financing. Overall, operational efficiency improved in asset turnover and cash from operations but cost control challenges and working capital management require attention. | Cost control appears effective as cost of goods sold increased moderately from RM5,497.6 million to RM6,331 million, consistent with revenue growth. Operating expenses decreased significantly from RM10,210.3 million to RM2,596 million, contributing to the improved operating margin. Asset turnover was notably high at 42.44, indicating strong revenue generation relative to asset base. Net cash from operations increased slightly to RM3,759.4 million from RM3,667.6 million, demonstrating stable cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased from RM519 million to RM640 million, which may reflect higher operational activity or stockpiling. Working capital management shows a decrease in current assets and an increase in current liabilities, which may require monitoring. Overall, cash flow from operations remains robust, supporting operational needs. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show increased leverage with debt to equity rising to 75.82% from 61.27%, signaling higher financial risk and potential vulnerability to interest rate changes. Interest expense increased from RM941 million to RM1,065 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased slightly from 1276.09% to 1175.87%, still indicating strong ability to cover interest but with some erosion. The current ratio decline to 71.75% suggests tighter liquidity and potential short-term solvency concerns. The effective tax rate remained stable, so no tax risk changes are evident. The increase in both current and non-current liabilities, alongside reduced liquidity ratios, points to elevated financial risk. The company should monitor its leverage and liquidity closely to avoid stress under adverse conditions. | Leverage risk has decreased as evidenced by a lower debt to equity ratio of 61.27% in 2023 from 73.72% in 2022, indicating reduced financial risk. However, the current ratio declined to 90.03% from 111.47%, suggesting tighter liquidity and potential short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense increased from RM657.4 million to RM941 million, but interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 1276.09% from 347.09%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest obligations and low risk of default. The effective tax rate decreased significantly to 16.25% from 25.80%, which may impact future tax liabilities and cash flows. The increase in current liabilities alongside decreased current assets warrants attention to short-term obligations. No other explicit financial risks are evident from the data provided. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity remains significant with net cash used in investing at RM8,247 million, slightly lower than 2023, indicating ongoing capital expenditure likely to support future growth. The positive net cash from financing of RM3,033 million contrasts with prior year outflows, suggesting new financing inflows that may fund expansion or refinance debt. Dividend payments decreased substantially to RM881 million from RM1,770 million, implying a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue growth across all major geographic regions, especially Türkiye and Europe, and healthcare services segment expansion, signals strong growth prospects. However, margin compression and increased leverage may constrain future profitability. Cash flow sustainability appears adequate given positive operating cash flow, but the company must balance investment and financing strategies to maintain financial stability. Overall, the outlook is cautiously optimistic with growth investments balanced against financial risk management. | Investment activity in 2023 shows a reduction in net cash used in investing activities to RM936.3 million from RM1,853.9 million in 2022, indicating a slowdown in capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash used in financing activities increased to RM3,998.6 million from RM2,919.9 million, driven largely by a significant increase in dividends paid from RM528.2 million to RM1,770.2 million, suggesting a more aggressive dividend policy which may impact cash reserves. Revenue growth across key geographic regions such as Singapore, Malaysia, India, Greater China, and Türkiye and Europe indicates diversified and expanding market presence, with Türkiye and Europe showing notable revenue increase to RM5,673 million from RM4,384.9 million. The sustainability of cash flows from operations and strong profitability metrics support continued operational funding and dividend payments, but the increased financing outflows and tighter liquidity ratios suggest the need for careful cash flow management going forward. |
