# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | IHH HEALTHCARE BERHAD's revenue shows a strong upward trend from RM17,988,687 million in 2022 to RM20,935 million in 2023, and further to RM24,383 million in 2024. Despite this growth, the gross margin slightly declined from 130.56% in 2022 to 129.80% in 2023 and 127.97% in 2024, indicating a marginal increase in cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service is predominantly driven by Hospital and Healthcare, increasing from RM16,615 million in 2022 to RM23,080 million in 2024, while Labs revenue remained relatively stable around RM1,000 million. Geographically, Türkiye and Europe show significant revenue growth from RM4,384,857 million in 2022 to RM7,423 million in 2024, followed by steady increases in Singapore and India, highlighting expanding market presence in these regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 9.99% in 2022 to 15.06% in 2023 but slightly decreased to 14.88% in 2024, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency over the period. Operating income rose from RM1,797,354 million in 2022 to RM3,152 million in 2023 and RM3,627 million in 2024, though the increase is less pronounced relative to revenue growth, suggesting some pressure on operating income conversion. Operating expenses increased from RM10,693,780 million in 2022 to RM11,545 million in 2023 and RM13,936 million in 2024, indicating rising costs but at a slower pace than revenue, which supports the improved operating margin. This suggests effective cost management despite expanding operations. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased significantly from 25.80% in 2022 to 16.25% in 2023 and further to 15.81% in 2024, positively impacting net profitability by reducing tax expenses relative to pre-tax income. Income tax expense decreased from RM571,949 million in 2022 to RM658 million in 2023 and RM594 million in 2024, consistent with the lower tax rate. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided financial data, indicating that the profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance and tax rate changes. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, IHH Healthcare Berhad demonstrated growth in total assets, increasing from RM50,192 million in 2023 to RM56,759 million, driven primarily by a rise in non-current assets from RM43,479 million to RM49,888 million. Total liabilities also increased significantly by 28.1% from RM17,833 million to RM22,851 million, with both current liabilities (RM7,456 million to RM9,576 million) and non-current liabilities (RM10,377 million to RM13,275 million) rising. Shareholders' equity grew modestly by 3.5% from RM29,106 million to RM30,140 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from RM7,840 million to RM9,708 million. The current ratio declined from 90.03% to 71.75%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio worsened from 61.27% to 75.82%, reflecting a higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company expanded its asset base and liabilities, but liquidity and capital structure metrics suggest increased financial risk and tighter short-term financial flexibility in 2024. | In 2023, IHH Healthcare Berhad showed a moderate increase in total assets to RM50,192 million from RM48,467 million in 2022, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets (RM43,479 million vs. RM40,185 million). Total liabilities decreased significantly to RM17,833 million from RM19,308 million, reflecting improved balance sheet strength. Current liabilities slightly increased to RM7,456 million from RM7,259 million, while non-current liabilities decreased to RM10,377 million from RM12,049 million. Shareholders' equity rose to RM29,106 million from RM26,192 million, indicating enhanced net worth. The current ratio declined to 90.03% from 114.10%, suggesting a reduction in short-term liquidity but still near parity. The debt to equity ratio improved drastically to 61.27% from an extremely high 73,718.81%, signaling a much healthier capital structure with lower leverage risk. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 reflects stronger equity base, reduced liabilities, and a more balanced capital structure, though liquidity tightened somewhat compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 16.5% from RM20,935 million in 2023 to RM24,383 million in 2024, driven mainly by growth in the Hospital and Healthcare segment (RM20,062 million to RM23,080 million) and geographic regions such as Türkiye and Europe (RM5,673 million to RM7,423 million). Gross profit rose by 19.5% to RM17,563 million, though the gross margin slightly declined from 129.80% to 127.97%, indicating a marginally higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income improved by 15.1% to RM3,627 million, but the operating margin slightly decreased from 15.06% to 14.88%. Net profit decreased by 6.8% to RM3,162 million, with net profit margin declining from 16.20% to 12.97%, reflecting increased interest expenses (RM941 million to RM1,065 million) and a lower effective tax rate (16.25% to 15.81%). Return on equity and return on assets both declined, from 12.26% to 10.67% and 6.87% to 5.91% respectively, indicating reduced earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets in 2024. | Revenue increased to RM20,935 million in 2023 from RM17,988.7 million in 2022, indicating top-line growth. Gross profit rose to RM14,697 million from RM12,491.1 million, maintaining a stable gross margin of 129.80% (slightly down from 130.56%). Operating income improved significantly to RM3,152 million from RM1,797.4 million, lifting the operating margin to 15.06% from 9.99%. Net profit more than doubled to RM3,391 million from RM1,645.1 million, with net profit margin increasing to 16.20% from 9.15%, reflecting improved earnings quality and operational leverage. Income before taxes rose to RM4,049 million from RM2,217.1 million, while income tax expense increased moderately to RM658 million from RM571.9 million, resulting in a lower effective tax rate of 16.25% compared to 25.80% in 2022. Return on equity was 12.26% and return on assets 6.87%, both indicating solid profitability relative to capital employed and asset base. Interest expense increased to RM941 million from RM657.4 million, but interest coverage improved to 334.96% from 273.40%, showing strong ability to service debt. Overall, 2023 profitability and earnings quality improved markedly with higher margins and returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, IHH Healthcare improved asset utilization as reflected by an increase in asset turnover from 42.44% in 2023 to 45.60% in 2024, indicating more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Cost of goods sold increased by 9.4%, but operating expenses rose more sharply by 20.7%, from RM11,545 million to RM13,936 million, suggesting some challenges in cost control. Net cash from operations increased by 14% to RM4,285 million, supporting operational cash flow strength. Inventories rose slightly from RM640 million to RM681 million, while working capital pressure is implied by the decline in current ratio and increase in current liabilities. Cash flow from investing activities turned positive to RM8,247 million from a negative RM936 million in 2023, indicating significant asset disposals or divestments. Net cash from financing decreased from RM3,999 million to RM3,033 million, and dividends paid reversed from RM1,770 million outflow to RM881 million inflow, possibly indicating dividend suspension or share buybacks. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with improved asset turnover and operating cash flow but rising operating expenses and working capital constraints. | Cost of goods sold increased to RM6,238 million from RM5,497.6 million, but gross profit growth outpaced cost increases, indicating effective cost control. Operating expenses rose to RM11,545 million from RM10,693.8 million, a moderate increase relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover was high at 42.44, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased slightly to RM3,759 million from RM3,667.6 million, supporting operational cash flow stability. Inventories increased to RM640 million from RM519.4 million, which may reflect inventory buildup but remains manageable. Working capital dynamics show current assets at RM6,713 million versus current liabilities of RM7,456 million, resulting in a current ratio below 1, indicating potential short-term liquidity pressure. Cash flow from investing was negative at RM936 million, suggesting investment outflows, while cash flow from financing was positive at RM3,999 million, indicating capital raising or debt management activities. Overall, operational efficiency improved with strong asset utilization and stable operating cash flow, though working capital management may require attention. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators point to increased leverage and liquidity risk in 2024. The debt to equity ratio rose substantially from 61.27% to 75.82%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. The current ratio declined from 90.03% to 71.75%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity and potential challenges in meeting current obligations. Interest expense increased by 13.2% to RM1,065 million, but interest coverage ratio improved slightly from 334.96% to 340.56%, suggesting operating income remains sufficient to cover interest costs comfortably. The effective tax rate decreased marginally from 16.25% to 15.81%, which does not indicate significant tax risk changes. The large positive net cash from investing in 2024 (RM8,247 million) may reflect asset sales that could impact future earnings capacity. Overall, the company faces heightened financial risk due to increased leverage and weaker liquidity, though interest coverage remains strong. | Leverage risk decreased substantially as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio dropping to 61.27% from an extremely high 73,718.81% in 2022, indicating a significant reduction in financial risk. Interest coverage ratio improved to 334.96% from 273.40%, showing enhanced ability to meet interest obligations despite higher interest expense (RM941 million vs. RM657.4 million). The current ratio declined to 90.03% from 114.10%, signaling tighter liquidity and potential short-term risk. The effective tax rate decreased to 16.25% from 25.80%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially impacting future tax liabilities. The increase in net cash from financing (RM3,999 million) alongside negative investing cash flow (-RM936 million) suggests active financing and investment strategies that could affect future risk profile. Overall, financial risk has diminished due to lower leverage and improved interest coverage, but liquidity constraints and tax rate changes warrant monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | The substantial positive net cash from investing activities in 2024 (RM8,247 million) contrasts with the prior year's outflow, suggesting significant divestment or asset monetization that may provide liquidity but could reduce future asset base and earnings potential. Net cash from financing activities decreased to RM3,033 million, and the reversal of dividends from an outflow of RM1,770 million in 2023 to an inflow of RM881 million in 2024 suggests a change in dividend policy, possibly suspending dividends or engaging in share repurchases. Revenue growth was broad-based across key geographic regions, notably Türkiye and Europe, which increased from RM5,673 million to RM7,423 million, indicating potential growth drivers. However, the decline in profitability margins and increased leverage may constrain future performance. The improved asset turnover and operational cash flow provide some support for sustainability. In summary, while investment activity and geographic expansion signal growth opportunities, the company must manage leverage and profitability pressures to sustain future financial performance. | Investment activity in 2023 showed a net cash outflow from investing of RM936 million, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing was positive at RM3,999 million, suggesting new capital inflows or debt restructuring to fund operations or investments. Dividend payments increased to RM1,770 million from RM528.2 million, reflecting a more generous dividend policy and confidence in cash flow sustainability. Revenue growth was driven mainly by the Hospital and Healthcare segment (RM20,062 million in 2023 vs. RM16,615 million in 2022), while Labs and IMU Health segments saw declines, indicating a strategic focus on core hospital services. Geographically, revenue increased across all major regions, notably Türkiye and Europe (RM5,673 million vs. RM4,384.9 million) and Singapore (RM5,746 million vs. RM5,143.1 million), suggesting geographic diversification and expansion. The strong operational cash flow and improved profitability metrics support a positive outlook for sustainable financial performance. However, attention to liquidity and working capital management will be important to maintain this trajectory. |
