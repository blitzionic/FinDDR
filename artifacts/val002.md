# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Golden Agri-Resources Ltd's revenue declined from 11,438,798 thousand USD in 2022 to 9,756,197 thousand USD in 2023, then partially recovered to 10,909,719 thousand USD in 2024. Despite this fluctuation, the gross margin improved steadily from 173.55% in 2022 to 181.02% in 2023 and slightly to 181.19% in 2024, indicating better cost control or pricing power relative to cost of goods sold. Revenue by product shows a significant increase in 'Palm, laurics and others' from 9,642,728 thousand USD in 2023 to 10,800,164 thousand USD in 2024, while 'Plantations and palm oil mills' revenue decreased from 113,469 thousand USD in 2023 to 109,555 thousand USD in 2024. Geographically, revenue from China decreased from 1,226,530 thousand USD in 2022 to 944,260 thousand USD in 2024, while Indonesia and Rest of Asia showed growth, with Indonesia rising from 1,993,065 thousand USD in 2023 to 2,345,730 thousand USD in 2024 and Rest of Asia from 2,616,773 thousand USD in 2023 to 2,977,858 thousand USD in 2024, suggesting shifting market dynamics and regional demand variations. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 12.72% in 2022 to 4.88% in 2023 but improved slightly to 5.60% in 2024, reflecting challenges in maintaining operating profitability despite revenue recovery. Operating income followed a similar pattern, dropping from 1,455,229 thousand USD in 2022 to 476,038 thousand USD in 2023, then increasing to 611,439 thousand USD in 2024, while revenue decreased overall. Operating expenses decreased from 1,570,349 thousand USD in 2022 to 1,375,258 thousand USD in 2023 but rose again to 1,441,057 thousand USD in 2024, indicating some cost management efforts but also rising expenses in 2024. The disparity between improving gross margin and weaker operating margin suggests increased operating costs or inefficiencies beyond direct costs impacting profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate fluctuated notably, increasing from 31.45% in 2022 to 43.94% in 2023 before decreasing to 26.05% in 2024, which significantly impacted net profit margins that fell from 6.84% in 2022 to 2.18% in 2023 and then rose to 3.78% in 2024. Income tax expense decreased from 388,361 thousand USD in 2022 to 166,671 thousand USD in 2023 and further to 145,164 thousand USD in 2024, reflecting the tax rate changes and possibly tax planning or regulatory impacts. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd demonstrated an overall strengthening in financial health. Total assets increased from USD 9,716,488 thousand in 2023 to USD 10,693,368 thousand, reflecting asset growth primarily in current assets (up from USD 3,916,771 thousand to USD 4,651,435 thousand) and non-current assets (up from USD 5,799,717 thousand to USD 6,041,933 thousand). Total liabilities rose from USD 4,536,584 thousand to USD 5,315,135 thousand, with both current liabilities (USD 3,207,148 thousand) and non-current liabilities (USD 2,106,987 thousand) increasing. Shareholders' equity improved modestly from USD 4,926,401 thousand to USD 5,102,192 thousand, supported by retained earnings growth from USD 3,530,202 thousand to USD 3,842,504 thousand. The current ratio slightly improved to 144.99% from 142.02%, indicating stable liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio increased to 104.17% from 92.09%, suggesting a higher leverage position. Overall, the company maintains a solid capital structure with increased asset base and equity, but with a moderate rise in leverage that warrants monitoring. | In 2023, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd showed a slight decrease in total assets to USD 9,716,488 thousand from USD 9,902,072 thousand in 2022, indicating a modest contraction in asset base. Current assets decreased to USD 3,916,771 thousand from USD 4,158,498 thousand, while non-current assets slightly increased to USD 5,799,717 thousand from USD 5,743,574 thousand, suggesting a shift towards longer-term asset holdings. Total liabilities decreased marginally to USD 4,536,584 thousand from USD 4,647,723 thousand, with current liabilities reducing significantly to USD 2,757,953 thousand from USD 3,193,889 thousand, improving short-term obligations. However, non-current liabilities increased to USD 1,778,631 thousand from USD 1,453,834 thousand, indicating higher long-term debt or obligations. Shareholders' equity slightly declined to USD 4,926,401 thousand from USD 5,001,461 thousand, despite a substantial increase in retained earnings to USD 3,530,202 thousand from USD 970,627 thousand, which may reflect dividend payments or other equity adjustments. The current ratio improved to 142.02% from 130.20%, indicating better liquidity. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 92%, reflecting a consistent capital structure with moderate leverage. Overall, the company maintained a stable financial position with improved liquidity and a balanced capital structure, though the slight decline in equity and asset base warrants monitoring. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Golden Agri-Resources Ltd showed marked improvement in profitability in 2024. Revenue increased by approximately 11.8% to USD 10,909,719 thousand from USD 9,756,197 thousand in 2023. Gross profit rose to USD 2,052,496 thousand from USD 1,851,296 thousand, maintaining a stable gross margin of 181.19%, slightly up from 181.02%. Operating income increased significantly by 28.4% to USD 611,439 thousand, improving the operating margin to 5.60% from 4.88%. Net profit nearly doubled to USD 412,095 thousand from USD 212,677 thousand, lifting the net profit margin to 3.78% from 2.18%. Return on equity (ROE) improved substantially to 8.22% from 4.28%, and return on assets (ROA) increased to 4.04% from 2.17%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate decreased sharply to 26.05% from 43.94%, contributing positively to net profitability. Interest expense increased slightly, but interest coverage improved to 251.15% from 212.82%, reflecting better ability to service debt. Overall, profitability and earnings quality showed strong improvement in 2024. | Golden Agri-Resources Ltd experienced a notable decline in profitability in 2023 compared to 2022. Revenue decreased by approximately 14.7% to USD 9,756,197 thousand from USD 11,438,798 thousand. Gross profit dropped significantly to USD 1,851,296 thousand from USD 3,025,578 thousand, reflecting a contraction in core profitability. Despite this, the gross margin improved slightly to 181.02% from 173.55%, indicating better cost management relative to revenue. Operating income fell sharply to USD 476,038 thousand from USD 1,455,229 thousand, with operating margin declining to 4.88% from 12.72%, signaling reduced operational efficiency or higher operating expenses relative to sales. Net profit declined drastically to USD 212,677 thousand from USD 782,103 thousand, with net profit margin shrinking to 2.18% from 6.84%, highlighting significant pressure on bottom-line earnings. Income before taxes and income tax expense both decreased, but the effective tax rate increased substantially to 43.94% from 31.45%, negatively impacting net profitability. Return on equity and return on assets were reported at 4.28% and 2.17% respectively in 2023, indicating modest returns on invested capital. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2023 with lower revenues and profits, compressed margins, and higher tax burden, suggesting challenges in sustaining profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 showed mixed signals. Cost of goods sold increased to USD 8,857,223 thousand from USD 7,904,901 thousand, but this was offset by higher revenue, resulting in a stable gross margin. Operating expenses rose moderately to USD 1,441,057 thousand from USD 1,375,258 thousand, indicating controlled cost growth relative to revenue. Asset turnover improved to 106.91% from 99.46%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations turned negative to USD (80,234) thousand from a positive USD 554,538 thousand in 2023, signaling potential challenges in cash generation from core operations. Inventories increased significantly to USD 1,950,294 thousand from USD 1,500,432 thousand, which may indicate higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Working capital increased with current assets outpacing current liabilities, supporting operational liquidity. Cash flow from investing remained negative but stable, while financing cash flow turned positive to USD 649,085 thousand from negative USD 175,966 thousand, possibly reflecting new financing activities. Overall, while asset utilization and cost control improved, the negative operating cash flow is a concern for operational cash efficiency. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed results. Cost of goods sold decreased to USD 7,904,901 thousand from USD 8,413,220 thousand in 2022, reflecting some cost control amid lower revenues. Operating expenses also declined to USD 1,375,258 thousand from USD 1,570,349 thousand, indicating efforts to reduce overheads. However, the sharp decline in operating income suggests that cost reductions were insufficient to offset revenue declines. Asset turnover was high at 99.46%, indicating strong utilization of assets to generate sales, though this figure appears unusually high and may reflect the multiplier or data specifics. Net cash from operations halved to USD 554,538 thousand from USD 1,085,130 thousand, signaling reduced cash generation capacity. Inventories slightly decreased to USD 1,500,432 thousand from USD 1,570,356 thousand, which may reflect inventory management adjustments. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supported by an improved current ratio of 142.02%. Cash flow from investing activities remained negative at USD (604,613) thousand, slightly less than the prior year, indicating ongoing investment. Net cash from financing activities was negative at USD (175,966) thousand, less than 2022, reflecting lower financing outflows. Overall, operational efficiency faced pressure from reduced cash flow generation and profitability, though asset utilization and cost control showed some positive aspects. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 suggest increased leverage and some liquidity pressures. The debt to equity ratio rose to 104.17% from 92.09%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. Current ratio improved slightly to 144.99%, suggesting adequate short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased to USD 243,451 thousand from USD 223,678 thousand, but interest coverage ratio improved to 251.15% from 212.82%, showing the company’s earnings sufficiently cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate decreased significantly to 26.05% from 43.94%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, reducing tax burden risk. Negative net cash from operations (USD (80,234) thousand) raises concerns about cash flow sustainability and potential liquidity risk if operational cash generation does not improve. The increase in inventories and liabilities also suggests potential working capital management risks. Overall, while the company maintains adequate liquidity and interest coverage, rising leverage and negative operating cash flow warrant close monitoring for early warning signs. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest moderate risk with some early warning signs. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at 92.09%, indicating consistent leverage but a relatively high level of debt compared to equity. The current ratio improved to 142.02%, suggesting adequate short-term liquidity to cover current liabilities. Interest expense increased to USD 223,678 thousand from USD 182,493 thousand, while interest coverage ratio deteriorated significantly to 212.82% from 797.42%, reflecting reduced earnings available to cover interest costs and increased financial risk. The effective tax rate rose sharply to 43.94% from 31.45%, which could impact net profitability and cash flows. The net decrease in cash of USD 226,041 thousand compared to a net increase in 2022 indicates liquidity strain. The increase in non-current liabilities to USD 1,778,631 thousand from USD 1,453,834 thousand may signal rising long-term obligations. These factors combined suggest heightened financial risk, particularly from reduced earnings coverage of interest and increased tax burden, warranting close monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd’s future financial performance may be influenced by its investment and financing activities. Net cash from investing remained negative at USD (595,231) thousand, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions that could support growth. The positive net cash from financing of USD 649,085 thousand in 2024, reversing the prior year's outflow, suggests new debt or equity financing, which may fund expansion but also increases leverage. Dividend payments decreased to USD 57,337 thousand from USD 93,996 thousand, possibly reflecting a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. Revenue growth was driven by the 'Palm, laurics and others' segment increasing to USD 10,800,164 thousand from USD 9,642,728 thousand, and geographic revenue growth in Indonesia, India, Rest of Asia, Europe, and Others, despite a decline in China. This geographic diversification and segment growth bode well for sustained revenue expansion. However, the negative operating cash flow and increased inventories highlight the need for improved cash flow management. Overall, the company appears positioned for growth with active investment and financing, but cash flow sustainability and leverage management will be critical for future financial stability. | Looking ahead, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd's future financial performance may face challenges but also shows areas of potential stability. The company continued investing with net cash used in investing activities at USD (604,613) thousand, slightly less than 2022, indicating ongoing capital expenditure or acquisitions to support growth. Net cash from operations declined but remained positive at USD 554,538 thousand, suggesting some cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments were reduced to USD 93,996 thousand from USD 170,984 thousand, reflecting a more conservative dividend policy likely aimed at preserving cash. Revenue by product shows a significant decrease in the 'Palm, laurics and others' segment to USD 9,642,728 thousand from USD 11,366,030 thousand, while 'Plantations and palm oil mills' revenue increased to USD 113,469 thousand from USD 72,768 thousand, indicating a possible strategic shift or market dynamics. Geographically, revenues declined across all major regions, notably India and Rest of Asia, which may impact future growth prospects. The company’s ability to manage costs, improve profitability, and maintain liquidity will be critical. The stable capital structure and ongoing investments suggest a focus on long-term growth, but the reduced profitability and cash flow pressures highlight the need for cautious financial management going forward. |
