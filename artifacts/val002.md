# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Golden Agri-Resources Ltd's revenue decreased from USD 11,438,798 thousand in 2022 to USD 9,756,197 thousand in 2023, then partially recovered to USD 10,909,719 thousand in 2024. Despite this fluctuation, the gross margin improved steadily from 173.55% in 2022 to 181.02% in 2023 and slightly to 181.19% in 2024, indicating better cost control or pricing power relative to cost of goods sold. Revenue by product shows a strong dominance of 'Palm, laurics and others' segment, increasing from USD 9,642,728 thousand in 2023 to USD 10,800,164 thousand in 2024, while 'Plantations and palm oil mills' also grew from USD 2,007,019 thousand to USD 2,173,821 thousand in the same period. Geographically, revenue from Indonesia and Rest of Asia increased notably from 2023 to 2024 (Indonesia: USD 1,993,065 thousand to USD 2,345,730 thousand; Rest of Asia: USD 2,616,773 thousand to USD 2,977,858 thousand), while China and India saw declines, reflecting possible market shifts or demand changes in these regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 12.72% in 2022 to 4.88% in 2023 but improved slightly to 5.60% in 2024, indicating pressure on operating profitability despite revenue recovery. Operating income followed a similar pattern, dropping from USD 1,455,229 thousand in 2022 to USD 476,038 thousand in 2023, then rising to USD 611,439 thousand in 2024, but still well below 2022 levels. Operating expenses decreased from USD 1,570,349 thousand in 2022 to USD 1,375,258 thousand in 2023 and then increased to USD 1,441,057 thousand in 2024, suggesting some cost management efforts but also rising costs in 2024 that may have constrained margin expansion. The ratio of operating income to revenue shows a recovery trend but highlights ongoing challenges in restoring operating efficiency to prior peak levels. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate fluctuated notably, increasing from 31.45% in 2022 to 43.94% in 2023 before decreasing to 26.05% in 2024, which positively impacted net profitability in 2024 compared to 2023. Income tax expense decreased from USD 388,361 thousand in 2022 to USD 166,671 thousand in 2023 and further to USD 145,164 thousand in 2024, aligning with the lower effective tax rate in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, so the tax rate changes appear to be the primary external factor influencing net profit trends during this period. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd demonstrated an overall strengthening in financial health. Total assets increased by approximately 10.1% from 9,716,488 to 10,693,368 (thousands USD), driven by growth in both current assets (up 18.8%) and non-current assets (up 4.2%). Total liabilities rose by 17.2% from 4,536,584 to 5,315,135, with current liabilities increasing by 16.3% and non-current liabilities by 18.4%. Shareholders' equity grew modestly by 3.6% to 5,102,192, supported by a 8.8% increase in retained earnings. The current ratio improved slightly from 142.02% to 144.99%, indicating stable liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio increased from 92.09% to 104.17%, reflecting a higher leverage position. Overall, the company maintained a solid capital structure with a balanced increase in assets and liabilities, while preserving liquidity and equity growth. | In 2023, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd's total assets slightly decreased to USD 9,716,488 thousand from USD 9,902,072 thousand in 2022, indicating a marginal contraction in asset base. Current assets also declined from USD 4,158,498 thousand to USD 3,916,771 thousand, while non-current assets increased slightly to USD 5,799,717 thousand. Total liabilities decreased to USD 4,536,584 thousand from USD 4,647,723 thousand, driven by a notable reduction in current liabilities from USD 3,193,889 thousand to USD 2,757,953 thousand, although non-current liabilities increased to USD 1,778,631 thousand from USD 1,453,834 thousand. Shareholders' equity decreased slightly to USD 4,926,401 thousand from USD 5,001,461 thousand, reflecting a modest decline in net worth. The current ratio improved to 142.02% from 130.20%, indicating better short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 92%, suggesting a consistent capital structure with moderate leverage. Overall, the company maintained a stable financial position with improved liquidity but slight pressure on equity and asset base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Golden Agri-Resources Ltd showed marked improvement in profitability in 2024. Revenue increased by 11.8% to 10,909,719 (thousands USD), with gross profit rising 10.9% to 2,052,496. Gross margin remained stable at 181.19%, slightly up from 181.02%. Operating income grew 28.4% to 611,439, improving operating margin from 4.88% to 5.60%. Net profit nearly doubled, increasing 93.7% to 412,095, with net profit margin rising from 2.18% to 3.78%. Return on equity improved significantly from 4.28% to 8.22%, and return on assets increased from 2.17% to 4.04%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of capital. The effective tax rate decreased substantially from 43.94% to 26.05%, contributing to higher net profitability. Interest expense increased slightly, but interest coverage improved from 212.82% to 251.15%, reflecting better ability to service debt. | Golden Agri-Resources Ltd experienced a decline in revenue to USD 9,756,197 thousand in 2023 from USD 11,438,798 thousand in 2022, a decrease of approximately 14.7%. Gross profit dropped significantly to USD 1,851,296 thousand from USD 3,025,578 thousand, reflecting a contraction in absolute profitability. Despite this, the gross margin improved slightly to 181.02% from 173.55%, indicating better cost efficiency relative to revenue. Operating income fell sharply to USD 476,038 thousand from USD 1,455,229 thousand, with operating margin declining to 4.88% from 12.72%, signaling reduced operational profitability. Net profit also decreased substantially to USD 212,677 thousand from USD 782,103 thousand, with net profit margin dropping to 2.18% from 6.84%. Return on equity and return on assets were reported at 4.28% and 2.17% respectively in 2023, with no comparable data for 2022. The effective tax rate increased markedly to 43.94% from 31.45%, negatively impacting net earnings. Interest expense increased to USD 223,678 thousand from USD 186,508 thousand, further pressuring profitability. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2023 with lower absolute profits and margins despite improved gross margin percentage. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed signals in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased by 12.0% to 8,857,223, slightly outpacing revenue growth, but gross profit still improved. Operating expenses rose moderately by 4.8% to 1,441,057, indicating some control over overhead costs relative to revenue. Asset turnover improved from 99.46% to 106.91%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations dropped sharply from 64,960 to 425, signaling potential challenges in converting earnings into cash. Inventories increased significantly by 30.0% to 1,950,294, which may indicate stock buildup or slower inventory turnover. Working capital increased as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, while profitability and asset use improved, cash flow from operations weakened, warranting attention. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed results. Cost of goods sold decreased to USD 7,904,901 thousand from USD 8,413,220 thousand in 2022, consistent with lower revenue. Operating expenses also declined to USD 1,375,258 thousand from USD 1,570,349 thousand, indicating some cost control. However, the sharp decline in operating income suggests that cost reductions were insufficient to offset revenue decline. Asset turnover was reported at 99.46%, indicating high utilization of assets to generate revenue, though no prior year comparison is available. Inventories slightly decreased to USD 1,500,432 thousand from USD 1,570,356 thousand, reflecting stable inventory management. Net cash from operations plunged dramatically to USD 64,960 thousand from USD 1,085,130 thousand, signaling potential challenges in converting earnings to cash. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supporting liquidity. Net cash from investing activities turned positive at USD 604,613 thousand from a negative USD 705,861 thousand, suggesting asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities improved to positive USD 175,966 thousand from negative USD 292,867 thousand, indicating possible debt issuance or equity inflows. Overall, operational efficiency was challenged by cash flow generation despite some cost control and strong asset turnover. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators suggest a moderate increase in leverage and some liquidity concerns. The debt to equity ratio rose from 92.09% to 104.17%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. Despite this, interest coverage improved from 212.82% to 251.15%, showing the company’s earnings comfortably cover interest expenses. The current ratio improved slightly to 144.99%, maintaining adequate short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate decreased significantly from 43.94% to 26.05%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially impacting future tax liabilities. The sharp decline in net cash from operations to near zero raises early warning flags about cash flow sustainability. Increased inventories and rising liabilities also suggest potential working capital management risks. Overall, while leverage and liquidity remain manageable, cash flow weakness and inventory buildup require monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 reveal emerging concerns. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at 92.09%, indicating consistent leverage but still relatively high. The current ratio improved to 142.02%, suggesting adequate short-term liquidity. However, interest coverage ratio deteriorated drastically to negative 212.82% from a very strong 780.25% in 2022, reflecting that operating income was insufficient to cover interest expenses, signaling potential solvency risk. The effective tax rate increased significantly to 43.94% from 31.45%, which may pressure net profitability. Interest expense increased to USD 223,678 thousand from USD 186,508 thousand despite lower income, possibly due to higher debt costs or increased borrowings. The sharp decline in net cash from operations to USD 64,960 thousand raises concerns about cash flow sufficiency to meet obligations. The increase in non-current liabilities to USD 1,778,631 thousand from USD 1,453,834 thousand may indicate rising long-term debt or obligations. These factors collectively suggest heightened financial risk and warrant close monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd’s future financial performance appears cautiously optimistic but with some risks. The company maintained strong investment activity with net cash from investing stable at around 595,231, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from financing increased substantially to 649,085, suggesting increased borrowing or capital raising, which may support growth but also raises leverage. Dividend payments decreased by 39% to 57,337, possibly reflecting a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. Revenue growth was broad-based across product lines and geographic regions, with notable increases in plantations and palm oil mills revenue and in key markets such as Indonesia, Rest of Asia, India, Europe, and Others, though China revenue declined. This geographic diversification supports revenue resilience. However, the near-zero operational cash flow and inventory buildup may pressure liquidity and operational flexibility. Sustained profitability improvements and asset utilization gains provide a positive outlook if cash flow issues are addressed. | Looking ahead, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd's positive net cash from investing activities of USD 604,613 thousand in 2023, reversing a prior year outflow, may indicate asset sales or reduced capital expenditures, potentially limiting growth investments. Net cash from financing activities was positive at USD 175,966 thousand, suggesting new financing inflows that could support liquidity or strategic initiatives. The company paid lower dividends of USD 93,996 thousand compared to USD 170,984 thousand in 2022, possibly reflecting cautious cash deployment. Revenue by product shows dominance of 'Palm, laurics and others' at USD 9,642,728 thousand compared to USD 2,007,019 thousand from 'Plantations and palm oil mills', indicating reliance on downstream products. Geographically, revenue concentration remains highest in Indonesia (USD 1,993,065 thousand) and Rest of Asia (USD 2,616,773 thousand), with declines in India and Europe, suggesting regional market shifts. The sustainability of cash flows is uncertain given the sharp drop in operating cash flow, though improved liquidity ratios and financing inflows provide some buffer. Overall, future performance may depend on stabilizing operational cash generation, managing financial risks, and strategic focus on key product segments and regions. |
