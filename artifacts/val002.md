# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue decreased from USD 11,438,798K to USD 9,756,197K, a decline of approximately 14.7%. However, revenue rebounded in 2024 to USD 10,909,719K, a 11.8% increase from 2023 but still 4.6% below 2022 levels. Gross profit followed a similar pattern, dropping from USD 3,025,578K in 2022 to USD 1,851,296K in 2023 (-38.8%), then rising to USD 2,052,496K in 2024 (+10.9% vs 2023). Gross margin improved steadily from 173.55% in 2022 to 181.02% in 2023 and slightly to 181.19% in 2024, indicating better cost control or pricing power despite revenue volatility. Revenue by product/service in 2024 shows dominance of 'Palm, laurics and others' at USD 10,800,164K (99.0% of total revenue), up from USD 9,642,728K in 2023 (+12.0%), while 'Plantations and palm oil mills' revenue increased modestly by 8.3% to USD 2,173,821K. Geographic revenue distribution in 2024 highlights Indonesia as the largest market (USD 2,345,730K, 21.5% of total), followed by Rest of Asia (USD 2,977,858K, 27.3%), China (USD 944,260K, 8.7%), India (USD 1,686,056K, 15.5%), Europe (USD 1,488,959K, 13.6%), and Others (USD 1,466,856K, 13.4%). Compared to 2023, Indonesia and Rest of Asia saw strong growth of 17.7% and 13.8% respectively, while China declined by 19.8%, indicating shifting regional demand dynamics. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income declined sharply from USD 1,455,229K in 2022 to USD 476,038K in 2023 (-67.3%), then improved to USD 611,439K in 2024 (+28.4% vs 2023) but remained well below 2022 levels. Operating margin mirrored this trend, dropping from 12.72% in 2022 to 4.88% in 2023, then rising to 5.60% in 2024. The operating income to revenue ratio indicates reduced operational efficiency in 2023 with partial recovery in 2024. Operating expenses decreased from USD 1,570,349K in 2022 to USD 1,375,258K in 2023 (-12.4%) and slightly increased to USD 1,441,057K in 2024 (+4.8%), showing some cost management but not enough to offset revenue declines. Overall, cost management was moderately effective but insufficient to maintain prior profitability levels, reflecting operational challenges during 2023 with gradual improvement in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate exhibited extreme volatility: an unusually high 926.07% in 2022, indicating significant tax anomalies or one-off tax benefits leading to a net loss despite positive pre-tax income; a negative tax rate of -43.94% in 2023, suggesting tax credits or adjustments that reduced tax expense below zero; and a negative tax rate of -26.05% in 2024, continuing the trend of tax benefits. These fluctuations significantly impacted net profit margins, which swung from a negative -0.44% in 2022 to positive 2.18% in 2023 and further to 3.78% in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items are detailed, but the tax rate anomalies imply unusual tax-related events affecting profitability. External factors such as regional revenue shifts, especially the decline in China and growth in Indonesia and Rest of Asia, may also influence profitability through market conditions and regulatory environments. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a stronger financial position with total assets increasing from 9,716,488 to 10,693,368 thousand USD, reflecting asset growth of approximately 10%. Both current assets and non-current assets grew, with current assets rising from 3,916,771 to 4,651,435 thousand USD, supporting improved liquidity. Total liabilities increased from 4,536,584 to 5,315,135 thousand USD, a rise of about 17%, driven by increases in both current liabilities (2,757,953 to 3,208,148 thousand USD) and non-current liabilities (1,778,631 to 2,106,987 thousand USD). Shareholders' equity also improved from 4,926,401 to 5,102,192 thousand USD, indicating retained earnings growth and a solid equity base. The current ratio slightly improved from 142.02% to 144.99%, suggesting stable short-term liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio increased from 92.09% to 104.17%, indicating a higher leverage level, which may warrant monitoring. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth in assets and equity with manageable increases in liabilities, maintaining a relatively strong financial health position in 2024. | In 2023, the company’s total assets slightly decreased to 9,716,488 thousand USD from 9,902,072 thousand USD in 2022, indicating a marginal contraction in asset base. Current assets declined from 4,158,498 to 3,916,771 thousand USD, while non-current assets increased slightly to 5,799,717 thousand USD. Total liabilities decreased to 4,536,584 thousand USD from 4,647,723 thousand USD, driven by a notable reduction in current liabilities from 3,193,889 to 2,757,953 thousand USD, although non-current liabilities increased from 1,453,834 to 1,778,631 thousand USD. Shareholders’ equity slightly decreased to 4,926,401 thousand USD from 5,001,461 thousand USD, but retained earnings surged significantly from 970,627 to 3,530,202 thousand USD, reflecting improved earnings retention. The current ratio improved from 130.20% to 142.02%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio remained stable around 92%, suggesting consistent leverage management. Overall, the balance sheet shows stable financial position with improved liquidity and controlled liabilities, despite a slight dip in total assets and equity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company showed significant improvement in profitability in 2024. Revenue increased by approximately 11.8% from 9,756,197 to 10,909,719 thousand USD. Gross profit rose from 1,851,296 to 2,052,496 thousand USD, with the gross margin remaining stable at around 181%, indicating consistent cost of goods sold management relative to revenue. Operating income increased by 28.4% from 476,038 to 611,439 thousand USD, improving the operating margin from 4.88% to 5.60%. Net profit nearly doubled from 212,677 to 412,095 thousand USD, lifting the net profit margin from 2.18% to 3.78%. Return on equity (ROE) improved markedly from 4.28% to 8.22%, and return on assets (ROA) increased from 2.17% to 4.04%, reflecting enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate decreased significantly from 43.94% to 26.05%, contributing to higher net profitability. Overall, 2024 shows improved revenue growth, margin expansion, and stronger returns, indicating sustainable earnings quality. | Revenue declined by approximately 14.7% from 11,438,798 thousand USD in 2022 to 9,756,197 thousand USD in 2023. Cost of goods sold also decreased but gross profit dropped sharply by 38.8% to 1,851,296 thousand USD. Gross margin improved slightly from 173.55% to 181.02%, indicating better cost control relative to revenue. Operating income fell significantly by 67.3% to 476,038 thousand USD, with operating margin declining from 12.72% to 4.88%, reflecting increased pressure on operating profitability. However, net profit turned positive to 212,677 thousand USD from a net loss of 50,739 thousand USD in 2022, improving net profit margin to 2.18% from negative. Return on equity and assets were positive at 4.28% and 2.17% respectively, indicating earnings sustainability and improved shareholder value creation. The effective tax rate was negative at (43.94%), contrasting with an abnormally high 926.07% in 2022, suggesting tax benefits or adjustments impacting net earnings. Overall, profitability improved from a loss to positive net income despite revenue decline, but margins remain under pressure. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by an increase in asset turnover from 99.46% to 106.91%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses increased modestly by 4.8% from 1,375,258 to 1,441,057 thousand USD, which is lower than the revenue growth rate, supporting improved operating margin. However, net cash from operations turned negative, declining sharply from a positive 554,538 thousand USD in 2023 to a negative 80,234 thousand USD in 2024, signaling potential challenges in cash flow generation despite higher reported profits. Inventories increased significantly from 1,500,432 to 1,950,294 thousand USD, which may indicate higher working capital tied up in stock. The current ratio improved slightly, suggesting adequate liquidity, but the negative operating cash flow warrants attention for operational cash management. Overall, while profitability and asset utilization improved, cash flow from operations and working capital management present areas for operational focus. | Operating expenses decreased by 12.4% to 1,375,258 thousand USD, contributing to some cost control, but operating income still declined sharply. The operating margin contraction to 4.88% indicates reduced operational efficiency. Asset turnover was very high at 99.46%, suggesting strong utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations halved to 554,538 thousand USD from 1,085,130 thousand USD, indicating weaker cash generation capacity. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, reflected in a higher current ratio. Inventories slightly decreased to 1,500,432 thousand USD from 1,570,356 thousand USD, indicating stable inventory management. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: strong asset turnover but declining operating profitability and cash flow generation. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show mixed signals in 2024. The debt to equity ratio increased from 92.09% to 104.17%, indicating higher leverage and potentially increased financial risk. Interest expense rose from 220,428 to 240,354 thousand USD, but interest coverage improved from (215.96%) to (254.39%), reflecting better ability to cover interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate decreased substantially, which may reduce tax-related risks. Liquidity remains stable with a current ratio of 144.99%, slightly up from 142.02%, suggesting sufficient short-term liquidity. However, the negative net cash from operations raises concerns about cash flow risk. Overall, while leverage and interest coverage remain manageable, the increased debt level combined with negative operating cash flow signals a need for careful monitoring of financial risk. | Leverage remained stable with debt to equity ratio at 92.09%, slightly lower than 92.93% in 2022, indicating consistent financial risk exposure. Liquidity improved as current ratio increased to 142.02%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense increased to 220,428 thousand USD from 182,493 thousand USD, while interest coverage ratio remained negative at (215.96%), though improved from (797.42%) in 2022, indicating ongoing challenges in covering interest costs from operating income. The effective tax rate swung to a negative (43.94%), which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces some uncertainty. The negative interest coverage and volatile tax rate suggest financial risk remains elevated, requiring monitoring. No significant changes in capital structure or liquidity risk were noted. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities remained consistent with net cash used in investing at approximately (595,231) thousand USD, similar to the prior year, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting growth. Financing cash flow turned positive to 649,085 thousand USD from a negative 175,966 thousand USD in 2023, suggesting new financing inflows, possibly debt or equity issuance, which may support future expansion. Dividends paid decreased from 93,996 to 57,337 thousand USD, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue growth was driven by increases in key geographic markets such as Indonesia (2,345,730 thousand USD) and Rest of Asia (2,977,858 thousand USD), while China revenue declined, signaling shifting market dynamics. Product-wise, growth in both plantations and palm oil mills and palm, laurics and others segments supports diversified revenue streams. Despite negative operating cash flow, the company’s investment and financing activities suggest a focus on growth and capital structure optimization. Future performance will depend on improving operational cash flow and managing leverage while capitalizing on growth markets. | Investment activities showed continued cash outflows with net cash from investing at (604,613) thousand USD, slightly lower than (705,861) thousand USD in 2022, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting future growth. Net cash from financing was negative at (175,966) thousand USD, less than the prior year, reflecting reduced financing outflows possibly due to lower dividend payments, which halved to 93,996 thousand USD from 170,984 thousand USD. The decline in cash and cash equivalents by 226,041 thousand USD suggests cash flow sustainability challenges. Revenue by product shows dominance of 'Palm, laurics and others' at 9,642,728 thousand USD, with plantations and palm oil mills contributing 2,007,019 thousand USD, indicating focus areas for growth. Geographically, revenue is diversified with significant contributions from Rest of Asia (2,616,773 thousand USD), Indonesia (1,993,065 thousand USD), and China (1,178,313 thousand USD), suggesting balanced market exposure. Overall, investment in growth continues but cash flow constraints and profitability pressures may impact future financial performance, requiring careful cash management and strategic focus on high-revenue segments and regions. |
