# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from 11,438,798 USD in 2022 to 9,756,197 USD in 2023, a decrease of approximately 14.7%, before rebounding to 10,909,719 USD in 2024, a 11.8% increase from 2023 but still 4.6% below 2022 levels. Gross profit followed a similar pattern, dropping from 3,025,578 USD in 2022 to 1,851,296 USD in 2023 (-38.8%), then rising to 2,052,496 USD in 2024 (+10.9% vs 2023). Despite fluctuations in absolute gross profit, gross margin improved steadily from 173.55% in 2022 to 181.02% in 2023 and slightly to 181.19% in 2024, indicating better cost control or pricing power relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service in 2024 shows a dominant contribution from 'Palm, laurics and others' at 10,800,164 USD (99.1% of total revenue), up from 9,642,728 USD in 2023 (+12.0%), while 'Plantations and palm oil mills' revenue increased by 8.3% from 2,007,019 USD in 2023 to 2,173,821 USD in 2024. Geographically, revenue distribution shifted with Indonesia growing significantly from 1,993,065 USD in 2023 to 2,345,730 USD in 2024 (+17.7%), Rest of Asia also increased by 13.8%, and India by 19.1%. Conversely, China revenue declined by 19.8% from 1,178,313 USD to 944,260 USD, and Europe grew moderately by 23.8%. These shifts suggest a strategic or market-driven pivot towards Southeast Asia and India, with reduced reliance on China. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income decreased sharply from 1,455,229 USD in 2022 to 476,038 USD in 2023 (-67.3%) but improved to 611,439 USD in 2024 (+28.4% vs 2023). Operating margin mirrored this trend, dropping from a strong 12.72% in 2022 to 4.88% in 2023, then recovering slightly to 5.60% in 2024. The operating income to revenue ratio indicates a significant deterioration in 2023, followed by modest recovery in 2024, reflecting challenges in operational efficiency or cost pressures. Operating expenses decreased from 1,570,349 USD in 2022 to 1,375,258 USD in 2023 (-12.4%) and then increased to 1,441,057 USD in 2024 (+4.8%), showing some cost management but also rising expenses in 2024. The cost of goods sold (COGS) decreased from 8,413,220 USD in 2022 to 7,904,901 USD in 2023 (-6.1%) but increased again to 8,857,223 USD in 2024 (+12.0%), indicating volatility in direct costs. Overall, while the company managed to reduce some operating expenses in 2023, the rebound in COGS and operating expenses in 2024 limited operating margin recovery, suggesting room for improved cost control and operational efficiency. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate exhibited extreme volatility, with an unusually high 926.07% in 2022, indicating significant tax anomalies or one-off tax charges that year, which likely contributed to the net loss of 50,739 USD despite positive operating income. In 2023 and 2024, the tax rate normalized to negative values of -43.94% and -26.05%, respectively, implying tax benefits or credits that enhanced net profitability. These negative tax rates positively impacted net profit margins, which improved from a negative -0.44% in 2022 to 2.18% in 2023 and further to 3.78% in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items are detailed, but the tax rate swings suggest one-off tax adjustments or external tax-related factors significantly influenced profitability. External factors such as geographic revenue shifts, especially the decline in China and growth in Southeast Asia and India, may reflect changing market conditions or geopolitical influences affecting profitability dynamics. |
