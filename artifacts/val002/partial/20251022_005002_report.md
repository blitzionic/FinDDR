# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue declined by 14.7% from USD 11,438,798K to USD 9,756,197K, followed by a recovery growth of 11.8% to USD 10,909,719K in 2024. Despite this partial rebound, 2024 revenue remains below 2022 levels by 4.6%. Gross profit mirrored this trend, dropping sharply from USD 3,025,578K in 2022 to USD 1,851,296K in 2023 (-38.8%), then increasing to USD 2,052,496K in 2024 (+10.9%). Gross margin improved steadily from 173.55% in 2022 to 181.02% in 2023 and slightly to 181.19% in 2024, indicating better cost control relative to revenue. Product/service revenue in 2024 shows dominance of 'Palm, laurics and others' at USD 10,800,164K (98.9% of total revenue), up 12.0% from USD 9,642,728K in 2023, while 'Plantations and palm oil mills' grew 8.3% to USD 2,173,821K. Geographic revenue distribution shifted with Indonesia increasing from USD 1,993,065K in 2023 to USD 2,345,730K in 2024 (+17.7%), Rest of Asia also grew by 13.8%, and India by 19.1%. Conversely, China revenue declined by 19.8% to USD 944,260K, and Europe increased by 23.8%. These shifts suggest a strategic focus on Southeast Asia and India markets while facing challenges in China. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income decreased significantly from USD 1,455,229K in 2022 to USD 476,038K in 2023 (-67.3%) but improved to USD 611,439K in 2024 (+28.4%). Operating margin followed a similar pattern, dropping from 12.72% in 2022 to 4.88% in 2023, then rising to 5.60% in 2024, indicating some recovery in operational efficiency but still well below 2022 levels. Operating expenses decreased from USD 1,570,349K in 2022 to USD 1,375,258K in 2023 (-12.4%) and slightly increased to USD 1,441,057K in 2024 (+4.8%), showing moderate cost management efforts. The ratio of operating income to revenue weakened in 2023 but improved in 2024, reflecting partial restoration of profitability through better cost control and revenue growth. Overall, while operating efficiency deteriorated sharply in 2023, 2024 shows signs of stabilization and incremental improvement. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate fluctuated notably, increasing from 31.45% in 2022 to 43.94% in 2023, then decreasing to 26.05% in 2024. This volatility in tax burden significantly impacted net profit margins, which fell from 6.84% in 2022 to 2.18% in 2023 before recovering to 3.78% in 2024. Income tax expense dropped from USD 388,361K in 2022 to USD 166,671K in 2023 (-57.1%) and further to USD 145,164K in 2024 (-12.9%), consistent with lower taxable income. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability likely include regional market shifts, especially the decline in China revenue and growth in Southeast Asia and India, which may reflect geopolitical or economic conditions influencing sales and tax strategies. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a stronger financial position compared to 2023, with total assets increasing from 9,716,488 to 10,693,368 thousand USD, reflecting asset growth of approximately 10%. Both current assets and non-current assets grew, with current assets rising from 3,916,771 to 4,651,435 thousand USD and non-current assets from 5,799,717 to 6,041,933 thousand USD. Total liabilities increased from 4,536,584 to 5,315,135 thousand USD, a rise of about 17%, driven by increases in both current liabilities (2,757,953 to 3,208,148 thousand USD) and non-current liabilities (1,778,631 to 2,106,987 thousand USD). Shareholders' equity improved modestly from 4,926,401 to 5,102,192 thousand USD, supported by retained earnings growth from 3,530,202 to 3,842,504 thousand USD. The current ratio slightly improved from 142.02% to 144.99%, indicating stable liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio increased from 92.09% to 104.17%, suggesting a higher leverage level. Overall, the balance sheet shows asset growth and equity strengthening, but with increased leverage and liabilities, indicating a need for careful liability management going forward. | In 2023, the company’s total assets slightly decreased to USD 9,716,488 thousand from USD 9,902,072 thousand in 2022, indicating a marginal contraction in asset base. Current assets declined from USD 4,158,498 thousand to USD 3,916,771 thousand, while non-current assets increased slightly to USD 5,799,717 thousand from USD 5,743,574 thousand, suggesting a shift towards longer-term asset holdings. Total liabilities decreased to USD 4,536,584 thousand from USD 4,647,723 thousand, driven by a notable reduction in current liabilities from USD 3,193,889 thousand to USD 2,757,953 thousand, partially offset by an increase in non-current liabilities from USD 1,453,834 thousand to USD 1,778,631 thousand. Shareholders’ equity slightly declined to USD 4,926,401 thousand from USD 5,001,461 thousand, despite a significant increase in retained earnings from USD 970,627 thousand to USD 3,530,202 thousand, indicating possible equity adjustments or dividend impacts. Liquidity improved as reflected by the current ratio rising from 130.20% to 142.02%, demonstrating stronger short-term financial stability. The debt to equity ratio remained relatively stable, slightly improving from 92.93% to 92.09%, indicating consistent leverage management. Overall, the company maintained a solid financial position with stable capital structure and improved liquidity, though total asset base and equity saw slight declines. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company’s profitability improved significantly in 2024. Revenue increased by approximately 11.8%, from 9,756,197 to 10,909,719 thousand USD. Gross profit rose from 1,851,296 to 2,052,496 thousand USD, with the gross margin remaining stable at around 181%. Operating income increased by 28.4%, from 476,038 to 611,439 thousand USD, leading to an improved operating margin from 4.88% to 5.60%. Net profit nearly doubled, rising from 212,677 to 412,095 thousand USD, and net profit margin improved from 2.18% to 3.78%. Return on equity (ROE) increased markedly from 4.28% to 8.22%, and return on assets (ROA) improved from 2.17% to 4.04%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and better utilization of equity and assets. The effective tax rate decreased significantly from 43.94% to 26.05%, contributing to higher net profitability. Overall, the company showed strong earnings growth and improved margins, reflecting sustainable profitability improvements in 2024. | The company experienced a decline in revenue to USD 9,756,197 thousand in 2023 from USD 11,438,798 thousand in 2022, a decrease of approximately 14.7%. Gross profit dropped significantly to USD 1,851,296 thousand from USD 3,025,578 thousand, reflecting a contraction in absolute profitability. Despite this, the gross margin improved from 173.55% to 181.02%, indicating better cost control or pricing power relative to revenue. Operating income sharply decreased to USD 476,038 thousand from USD 1,455,229 thousand, with operating margin falling from 12.72% to 4.88%, signaling increased operating expenses relative to sales. Net profit declined substantially to USD 212,677 thousand from USD 782,103 thousand, with net profit margin compressing from 6.84% to 2.18%, highlighting reduced bottom-line profitability. Return on equity and return on assets were reported at 4.28% and 2.17% respectively in 2023, with no comparable 2022 data, indicating modest returns on invested capital. The effective tax rate increased markedly from 31.45% to 43.94%, which negatively impacted net earnings. Overall, profitability and earnings quality weakened in 2023 with lower revenues and profits, compressed margins, and higher tax burden, raising concerns about earnings sustainability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by several metrics. The operating margin increased from 4.88% to 5.60%, indicating better cost control relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover improved from 99.46% to 106.91%, showing more effective use of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations turned negative, declining sharply from a positive 554,538 thousand USD in 2023 to a negative 80,234 thousand USD in 2024, signaling potential challenges in cash flow generation despite higher profits. Inventories increased significantly from 1,500,432 to 1,950,294 thousand USD, which may indicate higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Working capital increased as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supported by a slight improvement in the current ratio. Overall, while profitability and asset utilization improved, the negative operating cash flow and rising inventories suggest operational cash management issues that need addressing. | Operating expenses decreased from USD 1,570,349 thousand in 2022 to USD 1,375,258 thousand in 2023, reflecting some cost control efforts. However, the operating margin declined significantly to 4.88% from 12.72%, indicating that cost reductions were insufficient to offset revenue declines. Asset turnover was reported at 99.46% in 2023 (no 2022 data), suggesting the company generated nearly one dollar of revenue per dollar of assets, which is a strong utilization indicator. Net cash from operations halved to USD 554,538 thousand from USD 1,085,130 thousand, indicating reduced cash generation capacity. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supported by an improved current ratio of 142.02%. Inventories increased to USD 1,500,432 thousand from USD 1,365,594 thousand, which may indicate stock buildup or slower inventory turnover. Overall, operational efficiency showed mixed signals: improved asset utilization and cost control but significantly reduced cash flow generation and margin compression. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show mixed signals in 2024. Leverage increased as the debt to equity ratio rose from 92.09% to 104.17%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased from 223,678 to 243,451 thousand USD, but interest coverage improved from 212.82% to 251.15%, reflecting stronger operating income relative to interest costs and a better ability to service debt. Liquidity remained stable with a current ratio increase from 142.02% to 144.99%, suggesting adequate short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate decreased substantially from 43.94% to 26.05%, reducing tax burden risk. However, the negative net cash from operations raises concerns about cash flow sustainability. Overall, while the company’s ability to cover interest improved, increased leverage and negative operating cash flow highlight areas of financial risk that warrant monitoring. | Leverage remained stable with a debt to equity ratio of 92.09% in 2023, slightly improved from 92.93% in 2022, indicating consistent use of debt financing. Liquidity improved as the current ratio increased to 142.02% from 130.20%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense increased to USD 223,678 thousand from USD 186,508 thousand, while interest coverage ratio deteriorated sharply from 780.25% to 212.82%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest payments from operating income and signaling increased financial risk. The effective tax rate rose significantly to 43.94% from 31.45%, which may indicate higher tax burden or less tax efficiency, potentially impacting net profitability. The decline in net cash from operations and negative net increase in cash (-USD 226,041 thousand) also raise liquidity concerns. Overall, while leverage and liquidity ratios appear stable or improved, the sharp decline in interest coverage and increased tax rate highlight emerging financial risks that warrant close monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities remained consistent with net cash used in investing stable at around (595,231) thousand USD in 2024, similar to (604,613) thousand USD in 2023, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions. Financing cash flow turned positive from (175,966) thousand USD outflow in 2023 to 649,085 thousand USD inflow in 2024, suggesting new debt or equity financing to support growth or liquidity. Dividends paid decreased from 93,996 to 57,337 thousand USD, possibly reflecting a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. Revenue growth was driven by increases in key segments such as Palm, laurics and others (from 9,642,728 to 10,800,164 thousand USD) and geographic regions like Indonesia, India, Rest of Asia, Europe, and Others, despite a decline in China revenue. This geographic diversification and product growth indicate positive market trends. However, the negative operating cash flow and increased leverage suggest that sustaining growth will require careful cash flow management and possibly further financing. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued growth with active investment and financing strategies, but must address cash flow challenges to ensure future financial stability. | Investment activities showed continued outflows with net cash from investing at negative USD 604,613 thousand, slightly lower than 2022’s USD 705,861 thousand, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting future growth. Net cash from financing was negative USD 175,966 thousand, an improvement from negative USD 292,867 thousand in 2022, suggesting reduced debt repayments or dividend distributions. Dividends paid decreased to USD 93,996 thousand from USD 170,984 thousand, reflecting a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue by product shows a dominant contribution from 'Palm, laurics and others' at USD 9,642,728 thousand versus USD 2,007,019 thousand from 'Plantations and palm oil mills', indicating reliance on the former segment. Geographic revenue distribution is diversified with significant sales in Indonesia (USD 1,993,065 thousand), Rest of Asia (USD 2,616,773 thousand), and China (USD 1,178,313 thousand), suggesting exposure to Asian markets with potential growth opportunities. However, the overall revenue decline and reduced cash flow from operations may constrain near-term growth. The company’s investment in non-current assets and retained earnings growth to USD 3,530,202 thousand indicate a focus on long-term value creation. In summary, future performance depends on managing operational challenges, sustaining cash flow, and leveraging geographic and product diversification for growth. |
