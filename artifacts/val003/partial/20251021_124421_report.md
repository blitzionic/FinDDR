# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue declined from SGD 822,916K in 2022 to SGD 706,920K in 2023 (-14.1%), then partially recovered to SGD 751,564K in 2024 (+6.3% from 2023). Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) increased slightly in total from SGD 92,078K in 2022 to SGD 90,591K in 2023 and SGD 98,520K in 2024 (sum of components). Gross profit cannot be directly computed due to missing explicit gross profit data, but COGS relative to revenue suggests a stable cost base with slight increase in 2024. Revenue by product/service shows growth in all segments from 2023 to 2024: Healthcare services increased by 4.1% (SGD 283,427K to SGD 295,050K), Hospital services by 4.5% (SGD 330,589K to SGD 345,652K), Insurance services by 22.7% (SGD 139,681K to SGD 171,335K), and Investment holdings by 6.0% (SGD 6,908K to SGD 7,323K). This indicates diversification and strong growth particularly in Insurance services. Geographic revenue distribution remained heavily concentrated in Singapore, increasing from SGD 631,108K (89.3% of 2023 revenue) to SGD 669,145K (89.0% of 2024 revenue). Greater China and Rest of Asia revenues also grew modestly by 10.1% and 3.8% respectively, indicating slight regional expansion but Singapore remains dominant. Overall, revenue shows a recovery trend in 2024 after a dip in 2023, with product/service mix improving and geographic revenue stable with slight growth in key markets. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 16.37% in 2023 to 10.98% in 2024, indicating reduced operating efficiency. Operating income decreased from SGD 115,755K in 2023 to SGD 82,494K in 2024 (-28.7%), while revenue increased by 6.3%, showing operating income did not keep pace with revenue growth. Operating expenses increased significantly from approximately SGD 516,707K in 2023 to approximately SGD 571,062K in 2024 (sum of components), a 10.4% increase, outpacing revenue growth. This suggests cost management challenges, with expenses rising faster than revenue, negatively impacting operating margin. The large components of operating expenses such as the major line items (e.g., SGD 314,873K in 2024 vs SGD 301,506K in 2023) contributed to margin compression. Overall, operating efficiency deteriorated in 2024 due to rising costs and lower operating income relative to revenue. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 23.74% in 2023 to 28.38% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability. Income tax expense decreased from SGD 28,349K in 2023 to SGD 24,680K in 2024, but the higher tax rate on a lower pre-tax income base contributed to reduced net profit margin. Net profit margin declined from 12.89% in 2023 to 8.29% in 2024, reflecting the combined effect of lower operating income and higher tax rate. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns were reported in the data. External factors such as regional economic conditions or regulatory changes may have influenced the higher tax rate and cost increases, but no direct data is provided. Overall, the increase in effective tax rate and absence of one-off gains or losses contributed to the decline in net profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company maintained a stable overall financial position with total assets slightly increasing from SGD 1,528,230 thousand in 2023 to SGD 1,530,794 thousand. Current assets grew by approximately 6.5% to SGD 516,320 thousand, while non-current assets decreased by about 2.8% to SGD 1,014,474 thousand, indicating a possible shift in asset composition. Total liabilities decreased by 3.8% to SGD 465,815 thousand, driven by a significant reduction in non-current liabilities from SGD 104,994 thousand to SGD 83,878 thousand, despite a slight increase in current liabilities. Shareholders' equity improved by 2% to SGD 1,064,979 thousand, supported by an increase in retained earnings. Liquidity strengthened as reflected by the current ratio rising from 127.76% to 135.18%, and the debt to equity ratio improved from 46.40% to 43.74%, indicating better liability management and a stronger capital structure. | In 2023, the company maintained a strong overall financial position with total assets slightly decreasing from SGD 1,531,794 thousand in 2022 to SGD 1,528,230 thousand, indicating stable asset base. Current assets decreased marginally to SGD 484,697 thousand from SGD 494,349 thousand, while non-current assets increased slightly to SGD 1,043,533 thousand from SGD 1,037,445 thousand, reflecting a modest shift towards long-term investments or fixed assets. Total liabilities decreased from SGD 504,044 thousand to SGD 484,378 thousand, driven by a significant reduction in non-current liabilities from SGD 141,054 thousand to SGD 104,994 thousand, although current liabilities increased from SGD 362,990 thousand to SGD 379,384 thousand. Shareholders' equity improved to SGD 1,043,852 thousand from SGD 1,027,750 thousand, supported by an increase in retained earnings to SGD 592,293 thousand from SGD 572,826 thousand, indicating enhanced equity strength. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined slightly to 127.76% from 136.19%, but remains above 1, suggesting adequate short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved to 46.40% from 49.04%, reflecting better liability management and a more conservative capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet shows a stable and solid financial foundation with prudent liability management and a healthy equity position in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 6.3% from SGD 706,920 thousand in 2023 to SGD 751,564 thousand in 2024, driven by growth across all major product lines and geographic regions. However, profitability declined as operating income fell by 28.7% to SGD 82,494 thousand and net profit decreased by 31.6% to SGD 62,282 thousand. Operating margin contracted from 16.37% to 10.98%, and net profit margin declined from 12.89% to 8.29%, indicating margin pressure possibly due to higher operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Return on equity dropped from 8.79% to 5.91%, and return on assets decreased from 5.95% to 4.07%, reflecting lower earnings quality and reduced efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased from 23.74% to 28.38%, further impacting net profitability. | Revenue in 2023 declined to SGD 706,920 thousand from SGD 822,916 thousand in 2022, a decrease of approximately 14.1%, indicating a contraction in top-line performance. Despite this, the company generated an operating income of SGD 115,755 thousand in 2023, with an operating margin of 16.37%, demonstrating effective cost control relative to revenue. Net profit decreased to SGD 91,090 thousand from SGD 143,400 thousand in 2022, resulting in a lower net profit margin of 12.89% compared to 17.43% previously, reflecting margin compression possibly due to lower revenue and changes in cost structure. Income before taxes also declined to SGD 119,439 thousand from SGD 191,340 thousand, with an effective tax rate slightly reduced to 23.74% from 25.05%, which marginally supported net earnings. Return on equity stood at 8.79% and return on assets at 5.95%, indicating moderate profitability and earnings sustainability relative to equity and asset base. Interest expense decreased to SGD 6,078 thousand from SGD 6,851 thousand, supporting earnings quality by reducing financial costs. Overall, profitability in 2023 weakened compared to 2022 due to lower revenue and net income, but operating margins and returns remain positive, suggesting earnings quality is maintained albeit at a reduced scale. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased notably in 2024, with total operating expenses rising from approximately SGD 515,287 thousand in 2023 to SGD 571,062 thousand, contributing to the decline in operating income. Despite this, asset turnover improved from 46.20% to 49.14%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations dropped sharply by 54.5% to SGD 86,254 thousand, suggesting challenges in converting earnings into cash flow. Working capital showed a slight increase as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supporting liquidity. The decline in inventories from SGD 12,465 thousand to SGD 10,762 thousand may indicate improved inventory management or reduced stock levels. | Operating expenses in 2023 totaled approximately SGD 515,685 thousand (sum of provided components), slightly lower than the combined 2022 expenses, indicating some cost control efforts. The operating margin of 16.37% in 2023 reflects reasonable operational efficiency despite revenue decline. Asset turnover ratio is reported at 46.20%, which is unusually high and may indicate a data anomaly or a specific accounting treatment; however, if accurate, it suggests very high efficiency in asset utilization to generate revenue. Net cash from operations was strong at SGD 189,312 thousand, indicating robust cash generation capability from core business activities. Working capital management shows a slight decrease in current assets and an increase in current liabilities, leading to a reduced current ratio of 127.76%, but still indicating sufficient liquidity to cover short-term obligations. Inventories decreased slightly to SGD 12,465 thousand from SGD 13,098 thousand, suggesting efficient inventory management. Overall, operational efficiency in 2023 appears solid with effective cost control, strong cash flow generation, and adequate working capital management despite revenue pressures. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators improved with the debt to equity ratio decreasing from 46.40% to 43.74%, and non-current liabilities reduced significantly, lowering long-term financial risk. Liquidity improved as the current ratio increased to 135.18%, indicating a stronger ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense slightly decreased from SGD 6,078 thousand to SGD 5,779 thousand, and interest coverage ratio, while still very high, declined from 1904.49% to 1427.48%, reflecting reduced operating income but maintaining comfortable coverage of interest obligations. The increase in effective tax rate to 28.38% may pose a risk to net profitability. Overall, financial risk remains moderate with improved leverage and liquidity but some pressure on earnings and cash flow. | Leverage indicators show improvement with the debt to equity ratio decreasing to 46.40% from 49.04%, reflecting reduced financial risk and a more conservative capital structure. The current ratio declined to 127.76% from 136.19%, indicating a slight reduction in liquidity but remaining above 1, which suggests manageable short-term liquidity risk. Interest coverage ratio is exceptionally high at 1904.49%, indicating the company’s operating income vastly exceeds interest expenses, thus minimal risk of interest payment default. The effective tax rate decreased slightly to 23.74% from 25.05%, which does not indicate significant tax risk. No unusual spikes in interest expense or liabilities were noted. However, the decline in revenue and net profit margins could signal emerging operational risks if the trend continues. Overall, financial risk in 2023 is low with strong interest coverage, manageable leverage, and adequate liquidity, but monitoring revenue trends is advisable. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a slight reduction in net cash used for investing from SGD (12,409) thousand in 2023 to SGD (9,873) thousand in 2024, indicating continued but moderated capital expenditure or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities decreased from SGD (85,523) thousand to SGD (76,203) thousand, with dividends paid down from SGD (70,683) thousand to SGD (44,576) thousand, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue growth across all product segments and geographic regions, especially in insurance services and Singapore market, indicates positive growth momentum. However, the sharp decline in operating cash flow and profitability margins may constrain future financial flexibility. The company appears to be balancing growth investments with cautious cash management to sustain operations and shareholder returns. | Investment activities in 2023 show net cash outflow from investing of SGD (12,409) thousand, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions to support future growth. Net cash from financing activities was negative at SGD (85,523) thousand, reflecting debt repayments or dividend payments exceeding new financing, consistent with a conservative capital structure. Dividends paid remained stable at approximately SGD (70,683) thousand, suggesting a consistent dividend policy supporting shareholder returns. The net increase in cash of SGD 91,380 thousand indicates strong cash flow sustainability. Revenue by product shows healthcare services (SGD 283,427 thousand) and hospital services (SGD 330,589 thousand) as primary contributors, with insurance services and investment holdings smaller but notable segments, indicating diversified revenue streams. Geographically, Singapore dominates revenue at SGD 631,108 thousand, with smaller contributions from Greater China and Rest of Asia, suggesting concentration risk but also a strong domestic market presence. Given the stable equity base, strong cash flow, and ongoing investments, the company is positioned for moderate growth, though revenue decline in 2023 signals the need for strategic initiatives to reverse top-line contraction and leverage geographic and segment diversification for future performance improvement. |
