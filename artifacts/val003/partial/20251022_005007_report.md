# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from SGD 822,916K in 2022 to SGD 706,920K in 2023, a decrease of approximately 14.1%, before rebounding to SGD 751,564K in 2024, a 6.3% increase from 2023 but still 8.7% below 2022 levels. Gross profit was SGD 478,596K in 2023 and increased slightly to SGD 485,798K in 2024. Gross margin improved from 132.30% in 2023 to 135.36% in 2024, indicating better direct cost control or pricing power despite revenue fluctuations. By product/service, hospital services revenue dropped significantly from SGD 445,036K in 2022 to SGD 330,589K in 2023 (-25.7%) and partially recovered to SGD 345,652K in 2024 (+4.5%). Healthcare services revenue declined steadily from SGD 316,277K in 2022 to SGD 295,050K in 2024 (-6.8% over two years). Insurance services showed strong growth, rising from SGD 111,400K in 2022 to SGD 178,000K in 2024 (+59.8%), becoming a more significant revenue contributor. Investment holdings revenue increased markedly from SGD 14,466K in 2022 to SGD 44,894K in 2024 (+210.3%). Geographically, Singapore remains the dominant market, though revenue declined from SGD 756,131K in 2022 to SGD 669,145K in 2024 (-11.5%). Greater China revenue grew steadily from SGD 50,247K in 2022 to SGD 65,302K in 2024 (+30%), and Rest of Asia revenue remained stable around SGD 16-17K. This suggests a strategic shift with growing exposure in Greater China and diversification in product lines, especially insurance and investment holdings, partially offsetting declines in traditional hospital and healthcare services. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined sharply from 23.75% in 2022 to 16.37% in 2023 and further to 10.98% in 2024, reflecting deteriorating operating efficiency. Operating income fell from SGD 195,451K in 2022 to SGD 115,755K in 2023 (-40.8%) and further to SGD 82,494K in 2024 (-28.7% from 2023). Despite revenue recovery in 2024, operating income continued to decline, indicating rising operating expenses or less effective cost management. Operating expenses increased from SGD -362,841K in 2023 to SGD -403,304K in 2024 (+11.2%), outpacing revenue growth of 6.3%, which contributed to margin compression. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows a weakening profitability conversion, signaling potential inefficiencies or increased overhead costs. Overall, the company faces challenges in controlling operating expenses relative to revenue, impacting profitability despite stable gross margins. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 23.74% in 2023 to 28.38% in 2024, indicating a higher tax burden that negatively impacted net profit. Income tax expense decreased in absolute terms from SGD -28,349K in 2023 to SGD -24,680K in 2024, but relative to pre-tax income, the tax rate rose. Net profit margin declined from 12.89% in 2023 to 8.29% in 2024, partly due to this higher tax rate and lower operating income. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the data provided. External factors such as regional revenue shifts, with increased exposure to Greater China and stable Rest of Asia markets, may influence profitability through currency, regulatory, or market conditions, but specific external impacts are not detailed. The rising tax rate and operating cost pressures appear to be the main external and one-off influences on profitability in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company maintained a stable overall financial position with total assets slightly increasing from SGD 1,528,230K in 2023 to SGD 1,530,794K. Current assets grew by approximately 6.5%, supporting improved liquidity as reflected in the current ratio rising from 127.76% to 135.18%. Non-current assets decreased by about 2.8%, indicating possible asset disposals or depreciation outpacing acquisitions.

Shareholders' equity strengthened by 2%, reaching SGD 1,064,979K, supported by an increase in retained earnings. The debt to equity ratio improved from 46.40% to 43.74%, indicating a modest deleveraging and a stronger equity base. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a solid capital structure with enhanced liquidity and prudent liability management in 2024. | In 2023, the company maintained a stable overall financial position with total assets slightly decreasing from SGD 1,531,794K in 2022 to SGD 1,528,230K.

Total liabilities declined from SGD 504,044K to SGD 484,378K, driven by a notable reduction in non-current liabilities from SGD 141,054K to SGD 104,994K, despite a rise in current liabilities from SGD 362,990K to SGD 379,384K. Shareholders' equity improved to SGD 1,043,852K from SGD 1,027,750K, supported by an increase in retained earnings to SGD 592,293K. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, decreased from 136.19% to 127.76%, indicating a slight weakening but still a comfortable short-term liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio improved to 46.40% from 49.04%, reflecting better liability management and a stronger equity base. Overall, the balance sheet shows solid capital structure with moderate asset growth and prudent liability management in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 6.3% to SGD 751,564K in 2024, driven by growth across all major segments, notably insurance services which rose by 27.5%. Despite higher revenue, gross profit increased marginally by 1.5% to SGD 485,798K, with gross margin improving from 132.30% to 135.36%, indicating better cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. However, operating income declined sharply by 28.7% to SGD 82,494K, and operating margin contracted from 16.37% to 10.98%, reflecting increased operating expenses outpacing gross profit growth. Net profit fell by 31.6% to SGD 62,282K, with net profit margin decreasing from 12.89% to 8.29%. Return on equity and return on assets also declined significantly to 5.91% and 4.07% respectively, signaling reduced earnings quality and sustainability. The effective tax rate increased from 23.74% to 28.38%, further compressing net earnings. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 despite revenue growth, driven by rising costs and higher tax burden. | Revenue declined by 14.1% from SGD 822,916K in 2022 to SGD 706,920K in 2023. Despite this, the company achieved a gross profit of SGD 478,596K in 2023 with a very high gross margin of 132.30%, indicating strong cost control or pricing power relative to cost of goods sold (SGD -228,324K). Operating income decreased significantly by 40.8% to SGD 115,755K, with operating margin contracting from 23.75% to 16.37%. Net profit also declined by 36.5% to SGD 91,090K, with net profit margin falling from 17.43% to 12.89%. Return on equity was 8.79% and return on assets was 5.95%, reflecting moderate profitability and earnings sustainability despite the revenue decline. The effective tax rate slightly improved from 25.05% to 23.74%, supporting net income retention. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 due to lower revenue and operating income, but margins remain healthy and returns indicate sustainable earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased by 11.2% to SGD 403,304K, outpacing gross profit growth and resulting in a lower operating margin. Asset turnover improved from 46.20% to 49.14%, indicating more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations dropped sharply by 54.4% to SGD 86,254K, suggesting challenges in converting earnings into cash flow. Working capital showed a slight increase with current assets growing faster than current liabilities, supporting liquidity. Inventories decreased by 13.6%, which may reflect better inventory management or lower stock levels. The decline in operating cash flow despite improved asset turnover points to potential issues in receivables collection or increased working capital requirements. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with improved asset utilization but weaker cash flow generation and cost control. | Operating expenses in 2023 were SGD -362,841K, which alongside cost of goods sold of SGD -228,324K, contributed to the gross profit and operating income levels. The operating margin contraction to 16.37% suggests some pressure on cost control or revenue mix. Asset turnover was 46.20%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations was strong at SGD 189,312K, supporting operational cash flow health. Inventories slightly decreased to SGD 12,465K, indicating effective inventory management. Working capital dynamics show current liabilities increased while current assets slightly decreased, causing a dip in the current ratio but still maintaining liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency remains solid with good asset utilization and strong cash flow generation, though margin compression signals some cost or revenue challenges. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators improved with debt to equity ratio decreasing to 43.74%, reflecting reduced reliance on debt financing. Interest expense slightly decreased by 4.9% to SGD 5,779K, and interest coverage ratio, while still very high, declined from 1904.49% to 1427.48%, indicating a lower but still comfortable ability to cover interest obligations. The current ratio improved to 135.18%, enhancing short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate increased significantly, which could pose a risk to net profitability if sustained. The sharp decline in operating cash flow relative to net income raises concerns about cash flow sustainability. Overall, financial risk remains moderate with manageable leverage and liquidity, but attention is needed on cash flow trends and tax expense increases. | Leverage indicators improved with debt to equity ratio decreasing to 46.40% from 49.04%, reflecting reduced financial risk. Interest expense decreased slightly to SGD -6,078K, and interest coverage ratio, while lower than 2022, remained very high at 1904.49%, indicating strong ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, reducing tax burden risk. Current ratio declined to 127.76%, indicating a slight reduction in liquidity buffer but still above 1.0, suggesting manageable short-term liquidity risk. No significant increase in liabilities or interest expense was observed. Overall, financial risk remains low with strong interest coverage and manageable leverage, though monitoring liquidity trends is advisable. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities showed a slight reduction in cash outflows from investing activities, decreasing from SGD (12,409)K in 2023 to SGD (9,873)K in 2024, indicating a modest slowdown in capital expenditures or acquisitions. Dividends paid decreased by 37%, from SGD (70,683)K to SGD (44,576)K, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Net cash from financing activities also improved slightly, reflecting lower debt repayments or share buybacks. Revenue growth was broad-based across geographic regions, with Singapore revenue increasing by 6%, Greater China by 10%, and Rest of Asia by 3.8%, indicating positive market expansion. Segment-wise, insurance services showed the strongest growth, which may drive future profitability if cost controls improve. The minimal net increase in cash (SGD 178K) signals tight cash flow conditions. Overall, the company appears to be cautiously managing investments and dividends while expanding in key markets, but cash flow sustainability and profitability improvements will be critical for future performance. | Investment activities in 2023 showed net cash outflow from investing of SGD -12,409K, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting future growth. Net cash from financing was negative at SGD -85,523K, reflecting debt repayments or dividend payments, with dividends stable at SGD -70,683K, suggesting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue by product shows a shift with decreases in healthcare and hospital services but increases in insurance services and investment holdings, indicating potential growth areas. Geographically, revenue from Singapore declined, while Greater China revenue increased, signaling geographic diversification and growth potential in Greater China. Strong operational cash flow of SGD 189,312K supports cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company is investing for growth, maintaining dividend payments, and showing promising revenue shifts toward higher growth segments and regions, supporting positive future financial performance prospects. |
