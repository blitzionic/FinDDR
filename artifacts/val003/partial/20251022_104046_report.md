# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Raffles Medical Group Ltd's revenue declined from SGD 822,916,000 in 2022 to SGD 706,920,000 in 2023, then increased to SGD 751,564,000 in 2024, indicating a recovery trend after a dip. Gross margin improved steadily from 111.22% in 2022 to 132.16% in 2023 and further to 134.79% in 2024, reflecting enhanced profitability on core operations despite revenue fluctuations. By product/service, hospital services revenue grew from SGD 316,277,000 in 2022 to SGD 345,652,000 in 2024, healthcare services decreased from SGD 445,036,000 in 2022 to SGD 295,050,000 in 2024, insurance services increased from SGD 45,886,000 in 2022 to SGD 178,000,000 in 2024, and investment holdings revenue decreased from SGD 115,015,000 in 2022 to SGD 44,894,000 in 2024. Geographically, Singapore remained the dominant market with revenue decreasing from SGD 756,131,000 in 2022 to SGD 669,145,000 in 2024, while Greater China and Rest of Asia showed modest growth, with Greater China revenue rising from SGD 50,247,000 in 2022 to SGD 65,302,000 in 2024 and Rest of Asia remaining relatively stable around SGD 16-17 million. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 23.75% in 2022 to 16.37% in 2023 and further to 10.98% in 2024, indicating reduced operating profitability relative to revenue. Operating income decreased from SGD 195,451,000 in 2022 to SGD 115,755,000 in 2023 and further to SGD 82,494,000 in 2024, while revenue also declined but at a less steep rate, highlighting margin compression. Operating expenses reduced from SGD 535,172,000 in 2022 to SGD 363,844,000 in 2023 and then increased to SGD 407,604,000 in 2024, suggesting some cost control in 2023 but rising expenses in 2024 which may have pressured operating margins. The cost management shows mixed results with gross margin improving but operating margin declining, implying that while direct costs were managed well, operating expenses increased relative to revenue in the latest year. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate fluctuated from 25.05% in 2022 to 23.74% in 2023 and increased to 28.38% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability in 2024 compared to prior years. Income tax expense decreased from SGD 47,940,000 in 2022 to SGD 28,349,000 in 2023 and further to SGD 24,680,000 in 2024, consistent with lower pre-tax profits. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, indicating that the observed profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance and tax rate changes. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, Raffles Medical Group Ltd demonstrated stable financial health with total assets slightly increasing from SGD 1,528,230 thousand in 2023 to SGD 1,530,794 thousand. Current assets grew by approximately 6.5% to SGD 516,320 thousand, enhancing liquidity, while non-current assets decreased by about 2.8% to SGD 1,014,474 thousand. Total liabilities decreased by 3.8% to SGD 465,815 thousand, driven by a notable reduction in non-current liabilities from SGD 104,994 thousand to SGD 83,878 thousand, despite a slight increase in current liabilities. Shareholders' equity improved by 2.1% to SGD 1,049,766 thousand, supported by higher retained earnings. The current ratio improved from 127.76% to 135.18%, indicating stronger short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 47.13% to 44.37%, reflecting a modestly more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained a solid balance sheet with improved liquidity and a slightly stronger equity base in 2024. | In 2023, Raffles Medical Group Ltd maintained a stable financial position with total assets slightly decreasing from SGD 1,531,794K in 2022 to SGD 1,528,230K. Current assets decreased marginally to SGD 484,697K, while non-current assets increased slightly to SGD 1,043,533K. Total liabilities decreased from SGD 504,044K to SGD 484,378K, driven by a reduction in non-current liabilities from SGD 141,054K to SGD 104,994K, despite a rise in current liabilities from SGD 362,990K to SGD 379,384K. Shareholders' equity increased to SGD 1,027,738K, supported by higher retained earnings of SGD 592,293K. The current ratio declined from 136.19% to 127.76%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity but still above 1, suggesting adequate liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved to 47.13% from 49.79%, reflecting a modestly lower leverage and a stronger capital structure overall. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 6.3% from SGD 706,920 thousand in 2023 to SGD 751,564 thousand in 2024, driven by growth across all major segments, notably insurance services which rose from SGD 139,681 thousand to SGD 178,000 thousand. Gross profit increased marginally by 2.2% to SGD 490,098 thousand, with gross margin improving from 132.16% to 134.79%, indicating effective cost of goods sold management relative to revenue. However, operating income declined sharply by 28.8% to SGD 82,494 thousand, and operating margin contracted from 16.37% to 10.98%, reflecting higher operating expenses which rose by 12.1% to SGD 407,604 thousand. Net profit fell by 31.6% to SGD 62,282 thousand, with net profit margin decreasing from 12.89% to 8.29%. Return on equity and return on assets also declined significantly to 6.00% and 4.07% respectively, indicating reduced earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns. The effective tax rate increased from 23.74% to 28.38%, further compressing net profitability. Overall, while top-line growth was positive, profitability and earnings quality weakened notably in 2024. | Revenue declined by approximately 14.1% from SGD 822,916K in 2022 to SGD 706,920K in 2023. Despite this, gross profit decreased by a larger margin, from SGD 730,623K to SGD 479,599K, reflecting a significant increase in cost of goods sold from SGD 92,293K to SGD 227,321K. This led to an improved gross margin rising from 111.22% to 132.16%, which may indicate changes in revenue recognition or cost structure. Operating income fell by 40.8% to SGD 115,755K, with operating margin declining from 23.75% to 16.37%. Net profit decreased by 36.5% to SGD 91,090K, with net profit margin dropping from 17.43% to 12.89%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 8.93% and 5.95%, respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and asset base. The effective tax rate slightly decreased from 25.05% to 23.74%, contributing to net earnings. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023, with lower revenue and net income, but margins remain positive and returns reasonable. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased by 15.1% to SGD 261,466 thousand, outpacing revenue growth, which contributed to the modest gross profit increase. Operating expenses rose by 12.1%, indicating some cost pressures. Asset turnover improved from 46.20% to 49.14%, suggesting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations dropped sharply by 54.4% to SGD 86,254 thousand, signaling potential challenges in converting earnings into cash. Inventories decreased by 13.6% to SGD 10,762 thousand, which may reflect tighter inventory management. Working capital remained stable with a slight increase in current assets and current liabilities. Cash flow from investing activities remained negative but improved slightly, while financing cash outflows decreased, partly due to lower dividend payments. Overall, while asset utilization improved, cash flow generation from operations weakened significantly, indicating operational efficiency challenges in 2024. | Operating expenses decreased significantly by 32% from SGD 535,172K in 2022 to SGD 363,844K in 2023, indicating effective cost control measures. However, the sharp increase in cost of goods sold suggests potential inefficiencies or changes in product/service mix. Asset turnover was reported at 46.20%, indicating high utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories slightly decreased from SGD 13,098K to SGD 12,465K, reflecting stable inventory management. Net cash from operations was strong at SGD 189,312K, supporting operational cash flow health. Working capital showed a slight tightening as current liabilities increased while current assets decreased, but liquidity remains adequate. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: improved expense control and strong cash flow, but increased cost of goods sold and slight liquidity tightening. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators suggest moderate risk with some early warning signs. Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio fell from 47.13% to 44.37%, reducing financial risk. Liquidity improved with the current ratio rising to 135.18%, indicating strong short-term solvency. Interest expense slightly decreased to SGD 5,779 thousand, and interest coverage ratio, though reduced from 1904.49% to 1427.48%, remains very high, indicating ample ability to service debt. However, the effective tax rate increased significantly to 28.38%, which could pressure net income. The sharp decline in net cash from operations raises concerns about cash flow sustainability. The decline in profitability margins and returns also suggests potential operational risks. No significant increase in liabilities or interest burden was observed, but the reduced cash flow and profitability warrant close monitoring for emerging financial risks. | Leverage indicators improved with debt to equity ratio decreasing to 47.13% from 49.79%, reducing financial risk. Interest expense decreased slightly to SGD 6,078K, and interest coverage ratio, while lower than 2022, remains very high at 1904.49%, indicating strong ability to meet interest obligations. The current ratio declined to 127.76%, signaling a minor reduction in liquidity but still comfortable. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, which may reflect tax planning or changes in taxable income. No significant increase in liabilities or cash flow stress is evident. However, the decline in net profit margin and operating margin could signal emerging profitability risks. Overall, financial risk remains low with strong coverage and manageable leverage, but profitability pressures warrant monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Raffles Medical Group Ltd's future financial performance may face headwinds due to reduced profitability and cash flow generation in 2024. Investment activity remained modest with net cash used in investing improving slightly to SGD (9,873) thousand, indicating controlled capital expenditures. Dividend payments decreased by 37% to SGD (44,576) thousand, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy possibly aimed at preserving cash. Revenue growth in key segments such as hospital and healthcare services, as well as geographic expansion in Singapore and Greater China, provides positive cues for future top-line growth. However, the decline in operating income and net profit margins, coupled with weaker cash flow from operations, may constrain reinvestment capacity and dividend sustainability. The company’s strong balance sheet and improved liquidity provide a buffer, but management will need to focus on cost control and operational efficiency to restore profitability and cash flow strength for sustainable future performance. | Investment activity in 2023 shows net cash used in investing of SGD (12,409)K, indicating moderate capital expenditure or acquisitions. Net cash from financing was negative at SGD (85,523)K, reflecting debt repayments or dividend payments, with dividends stable at approximately SGD (70,683)K, suggesting a consistent dividend policy. Cash increased by SGD 91,380K, supporting liquidity and operational sustainability. Revenue by product/service shows a shift with hospital services increasing to SGD 330,589K and insurance services growing significantly to SGD 139,681K, while investment holdings revenue declined sharply to SGD 44,894K. Geographically, Singapore remains the dominant market but revenue declined to SGD 631,108K, while Greater China revenue increased to SGD 59,324K, indicating potential growth opportunities in that region. Overall, the company appears to be investing cautiously, maintaining dividend payments, and diversifying revenue streams with geographic expansion, supporting a cautiously optimistic future financial outlook. |

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
