# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Raffles Medical Group Ltd's revenue declined from $822,916,000 in 2022 to $706,920,000 in 2023, then partially recovered to $751,564,000 in 2024, indicating a dip followed by a moderate rebound. Gross margin slightly decreased from 88.68% in 2022 to 87.19% in 2023, with 2024 data unavailable, suggesting a minor compression in profitability at the gross level. Revenue by product/service shows a significant drop in Healthcare services from $445,036,000 in 2022 to $295,050,000 in 2024, while Hospital services increased from $316,277,000 in 2022 to $345,652,000 in 2024, and Insurance services steadily grew from $115,015,000 to $177,985,000 over the same period. Investment holdings revenue remained relatively stable around $45 million. Geographically, Singapore remains the dominant market but revenue declined from $756,131,000 in 2022 to $669,145,000 in 2024, while Greater China and Rest of Asia regions showed modest growth, indicating some geographic diversification but with Singapore still the primary revenue source. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 23.75% in 2022 to 16.37% in 2023 and further to 10.98% in 2024, reflecting decreasing operating profitability. Operating income fell from $195,451,000 in 2022 to $115,755,000 in 2023 and then to $82,494,000 in 2024, while revenue also declined, but the sharper drop in operating income indicates rising operating costs or lower operational leverage. Operating expenses decreased from $534,272,000 in 2022 to $381,194,000 in 2023, but 2024 data is unavailable, making it difficult to assess cost control in the latest year. The decline in operating margin despite lower operating expenses in 2023 suggests that cost management may not have kept pace with revenue declines or that fixed costs remain high, impacting efficiency. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 25.05% in 2022 to 28.38% in 2024, with a dip to 23.74% in 2023, which likely exerted additional pressure on net profitability in 2024. Income tax expense decreased from $47,940,000 in 2022 to $28,349,000 in 2023 and further to $24,680,000 in 2024, consistent with lower pre-tax profits. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided data, indicating that the observed profitability trends are primarily driven by operational and tax rate changes rather than one-off events. |
