# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Raffles Medical Group Ltd's revenue declined from $822,916,000 in 2022 to $706,920,000 in 2023, then slightly increased to $751,564,000 in 2024, indicating a recovery trend after a significant drop. Gross margin decreased marginally from 88.68% in 2022 to 87.19% in 2023, with 2024 data unavailable, suggesting stable but slightly compressed profitability at the gross level. Revenue by product/service shows a notable shift: Healthcare services revenue dropped sharply from $445,036,000 in 2022 to $295,050,000 in 2024, while Hospital services increased from $316,277,000 to $345,652,000, and Insurance services grew from $115,015,000 to $177,985,000 over the same period, indicating a strategic pivot or market demand changes. Geographically, Singapore remains the dominant market but revenue declined from $756,131,000 in 2022 to $669,145,000 in 2024, while Greater China and Rest of Asia revenues increased modestly, reflecting some regional diversification but overall concentration in Singapore. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 23.75% in 2022 to 16.37% in 2023 and further to 10.98% in 2024, indicating deteriorating operating efficiency. Operating income fell from $195,451,000 in 2022 to $115,755,000 in 2023 and then to $82,494,000 in 2024, despite the partial revenue recovery in 2024, highlighting rising operating costs or reduced operational leverage. Operating expenses decreased slightly from $534,272,000 in 2022 to $500,535,000 in 2023, but 2024 data is unavailable, suggesting some cost control efforts in 2023. However, the sharper decline in operating income relative to revenue implies that cost management was insufficient to offset revenue pressures, leading to margin compression. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 25.05% in 2022 to 28.38% in 2024, with a dip to 23.74% in 2023, which negatively impacted net profitability in 2024 compared to prior years. Income tax expense decreased from $47,940,000 in 2022 to $28,349,000 in 2023 and further to $24,680,000 in 2024, consistent with lower pre-tax profits. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, indicating that the observed profitability trends are primarily driven by operational and tax rate changes rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, Raffles Medical Group Ltd demonstrated stable financial health with total assets slightly increasing from 1,528,230 to 1,530,794 (thousands USD), indicating asset base stability. Current assets grew from 484,697 to 516,320, improving liquidity, as reflected in the current ratio rising from 127.76% to 135.18%, signaling enhanced short-term financial strength. Non-current assets decreased from 1,043,533 to 1,014,474, possibly due to asset disposals or depreciation. Total liabilities decreased from 484,378 to 465,815, driven by a reduction in non-current liabilities from 104,994 to 83,878, while current liabilities slightly increased from 379,384 to 381,937. The debt to equity ratio improved from 47.13% to 44.37%, indicating a modest reduction in leverage and a stronger equity base, which increased from 1,027,738 to 1,049,766. Retained earnings also rose from 592,293 to 609,960, supporting equity growth. Inventories decreased from 12,465 to 10,762, suggesting better inventory management or lower stock levels. Overall, the capital structure is conservative with a solid equity cushion and improved liquidity position in 2024. | In 2023, Raffles Medical Group Ltd maintained a stable financial position with total assets slightly decreasing from $1,531,794K in 2022 to $1,528,230K. Current assets decreased marginally to $484,697K, while non-current assets increased slightly to $1,043,533K. Total liabilities decreased from $504,044K to $484,378K, driven by a reduction in non-current liabilities from $141,054K to $104,994K, although current liabilities increased from $362,990K to $379,384K. Shareholders' equity increased modestly to $1,027,738K, supported by higher retained earnings of $592,293K. The current ratio declined from 136.19% to 127.76%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity but still above 1, suggesting adequate liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved slightly from 49.79% to 47.13%, reflecting a modestly lower leverage and a relatively conservative capital structure. Overall, the Group's financial health in 2023 remains solid with stable asset base, controlled liabilities, and a strong equity position. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 6.3% from 706,920 in 2023 to 751,564 in 2024, driven by growth across all major segments: healthcare services (+4.1%), hospital services (+4.6%), insurance services (+23.2%), and stable investment holdings. Despite revenue growth, operating income declined by 28.8% from 115,755 to 82,494, and net profit fell by 31.6% from 91,090 to 62,282, indicating margin compression. Operating margin dropped from 16.37% to 10.98%, and net profit margin declined from 12.89% to 8.29%, reflecting increased costs or lower operational efficiency. Income before taxes decreased by 27.2% to 86,962, while income tax expense fell less proportionally, resulting in an effective tax rate increase from 23.74% to 28.38%, negatively impacting net earnings. Return on equity declined from 8.93% to 6.00%, and return on assets decreased from 5.95% to 4.07%, signaling reduced profitability and earnings quality. Interest expense slightly improved from 6,078 to 5,779, but interest coverage ratio decreased from 1904.49% to 1427.48%, still indicating strong ability to cover interest but with some weakening. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 despite revenue growth, driven by margin pressure and higher tax burden. | Raffles Medical Group experienced a decline in profitability in 2023 compared to 2022. Revenue decreased by approximately 14.1% from $822,916K to $706,920K. Gross profit fell by 15.5% to $616,398K, with gross margin contracting slightly from 88.68% to 87.19%. Operating income dropped significantly by 40.8% to $115,755K, causing operating margin to decline from 23.75% to 16.37%. Net profit decreased by 36.5% to $91,090K, with net profit margin falling from 17.43% to 12.89%. Income before taxes also declined by 37.5% to $119,439K, and the effective tax rate decreased from 25.05% to 23.74%, slightly mitigating the net profit impact. Return on equity and return on assets were reported for 2023 at 8.93% and 5.95% respectively, indicating moderate returns on invested capital. The negative interest expense figure (-$6,078K) in 2023, compared to a positive $6,851K in 2022, suggests interest income or a reversal of interest costs, but the interest coverage ratio turned negative (-1904.49%) from a very high positive level, indicating earnings before interest and taxes were insufficient to cover interest expenses or that interest income distorted the metric. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2023 with lower revenue and profitability margins, though returns remain positive. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed signals in 2024. Asset turnover improved from 46.20% to 49.14%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations dropped sharply by 54.4% from 189,312 to 86,254, suggesting challenges in converting earnings into cash or changes in working capital. Inventories decreased, which may reflect tighter inventory control. The current ratio improvement to 135.18% supports liquidity but current liabilities slightly increased, which may affect short-term obligations. Net cash from investing activities decreased from 12,409 to 9,873, indicating reduced investment outflows or asset purchases. Net cash from financing activities declined from 85,523 to 76,203, and dividends paid dropped significantly from 70,683 to 44,576, possibly reflecting a more conservative cash distribution policy. The minimal net increase in cash of 178 compared to 91,380 in 2023 highlights constrained cash flow generation. Overall, while asset utilization improved, cash flow from operations and working capital management appear less robust in 2024. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed signals. Cost of goods sold decreased slightly by 2.9% to $90,522K, helping maintain a high gross margin of 87.19%. Operating expenses were reduced by 6.3% to $500,535K, reflecting some cost control efforts. However, the sharp decline in operating income suggests that cost reductions did not fully offset the revenue decline. Inventories decreased slightly to $12,465K, indicating stable inventory management. Asset turnover was reported at 46.20%, a high figure suggesting efficient use of assets to generate revenue, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations decreased marginally by 3.5% to $189,312K, indicating relatively stable cash generation despite lower profits. Working capital dynamics show a slight increase in current liabilities and a decrease in current assets, which may pressure short-term operational liquidity. Net cash from investing activities decreased to $12,409K, indicating lower investment outflows. Overall, the Group maintained reasonable operational efficiency with controlled costs and strong cash flow from operations, though revenue declines impacted profitability. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators suggest moderate risk with some early warning signs. Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio improved from 47.13% to 44.37%, and total liabilities declined. Liquidity strengthened with current ratio rising to 135.18%, indicating good short-term solvency. Interest expense slightly decreased, but interest coverage ratio fell from 1904.49% to 1427.48%, still very strong but showing some erosion in buffer to meet interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased significantly from 23.74% to 28.38%, which could pressure net profitability and cash flows. Operating income and net profit declines raise concerns about earnings sustainability. The sharp drop in net cash from operations and minimal cash increase may signal liquidity stress if trends continue. No unusual spikes in liabilities or interest expenses were noted, but margin compression and tax rate increase warrant monitoring. Overall, financial risk remains moderate but with caution advised on profitability and cash flow trends. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest moderate risk with some early warning signs. The current ratio declined to 127.76%, still above 1 but lower than 2022, indicating slightly reduced liquidity buffer. Debt to equity ratio improved to 47.13%, reflecting moderate leverage and a conservative capital structure. The interest coverage ratio turned negative (-1904.49%) from a very high positive level in 2022, signaling that operating income was insufficient to cover interest expenses or that interest income distorted the metric, which could be a risk factor if sustained. The effective tax rate decreased slightly to 23.74%, reducing tax burden risk. The negative interest expense figure (-$6,078K) may indicate interest income or financial gains, but it complicates traditional risk assessment. The decline in net profit margin and operating margin also suggests earnings pressure. Overall, while leverage and liquidity remain manageable, the negative interest coverage and declining profitability warrant monitoring for potential financial stress. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Raffles Medical Group Ltd's revenue growth across all segments and geographic regions, especially insurance services (+23.2%) and Singapore market expansion, provide positive cues for future top-line performance. However, declining operating and net margins, higher effective tax rate, and reduced net cash from operations raise concerns about sustainable profitability and cash flow. The company reduced dividends paid by 37%, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Investment activity decreased slightly, suggesting cautious capital expenditure. The stable asset base and improved asset turnover imply potential for operational leverage if cost control improves. The strong equity position and moderate leverage provide financial flexibility for future investments or debt management. To sustain future performance, focus on margin recovery, tax efficiency, and cash flow enhancement will be critical. Geographic diversification and segment growth offer growth avenues, but operational and financial discipline will be key to translating revenue gains into improved earnings and cash generation. | Looking ahead, Raffles Medical Group's future financial performance may face challenges due to the revenue decline in 2023, particularly in healthcare services revenue which dropped significantly from $445,036K to $283,427K. However, hospital services and insurance services revenues increased, indicating potential growth areas. Geographic revenue shows a decline in Singapore but growth in Greater China, suggesting geographic diversification opportunities. Net cash from operations remains strong at $189,312K, supporting cash flow sustainability. Net cash from financing activities decreased substantially to $85,523K, and dividends increased to $70,683K, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns but potentially less external financing. Investment cash outflows decreased, possibly signaling reduced capital expenditure or acquisitions. The stable asset base and equity growth support ongoing operations. Overall, the Group's future performance will depend on its ability to stabilize revenue, especially in healthcare services, leverage growth in other segments and regions, and maintain strong cash flow and dividend policies. |
