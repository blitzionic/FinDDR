# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, Q & M Dental Group's revenue remained relatively stable, with SGD 181,214K in 2022, slightly increasing to SGD 182,723K in 2023, then marginally decreasing to SGD 180,674K in 2024. Gross profit showed a modest increase from SGD 156,044K in 2022 to SGD 160,404K in 2023, and slightly decreased to SGD 160,246K in 2024. The gross margin remained above 110% throughout, specifically 113.89% in 2022, 111.67% in 2023, and 111.31% in 2024, indicating consistent high profitability relative to direct costs. Revenue by product/service shifted from a more diversified base in 2022 (Primary healthcare SGD 160,895K, Dental equipment and supplies distribution SGD 11,236K, Medical laboratory SGD 9,083K) to a focus on the core dental business in 2023 and 2024 (SGD 172,960K and SGD 173,787K respectively), with other businesses declining from SGD 9,763K in 2023 to SGD 6,887K in 2024. Geographically, Singapore remained the dominant market with revenue around SGD 167,288K to SGD 171,438K, Malaysia showed slight fluctuations (SGD 13,139K in 2022, SGD 11,116K in 2023, SGD 13,355K in 2024), and China revenue declined from SGD 787K in 2022 to negligible in 2024, indicating a withdrawal or reduced focus in that region. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income more than doubled from SGD 23,808K in 2022 to SGD 51,551K in 2023 and further increased to SGD 54,360K in 2024, reflecting improved operational profitability despite stable revenue. Operating margin remained very low but improved slightly from 0.01% in 2022 to 0.03% in both 2023 and 2024, suggesting tight control over operating expenses relative to revenue. Operating expenses decreased from SGD 132,236K in 2022 to SGD 108,853K in 2023 and further to SGD 105,886K in 2024, indicating effective cost management. The reduction in operating expenses alongside stable revenue contributed to the significant increase in operating income. The operating income as a percentage of revenue improved, signaling enhanced operational efficiency and profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 16.96% in 2022 to 18.96% in 2023 and further dropped to 11.43% in 2024, which positively impacted net profit margins, increasing from 6.54% in 2022 to 7.23% in 2024. There are no explicitly listed non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability in the provided data. The declining tax rate likely contributed to improved net profitability despite stable revenue and operating margins. |

Overall, the company maintained solid financial health with stable equity, reduced leverage, and strong liquidity in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue slightly declined to SGD 180,674 thousand in 2024 from SGD 182,723 thousand in 2023, mainly due to a decrease in other businesses revenue (SGD 6,887 thousand vs. SGD 9,763 thousand) and Singapore revenue (SGD 167,319 thousand vs. SGD 171,438 thousand), partially offset by growth in Malaysia revenue (SGD 13,355 thousand vs. SGD 11,116 thousand). Gross profit remained stable at SGD 160,246 thousand, marginally lower than SGD 160,404 thousand in 2023, maintaining a high gross margin of 111.31% (slightly down from 111.67%).

Gross profit improved to SGD 160,404 thousand from SGD 156,044 thousand, although the gross margin declined slightly to 111.67% from 113.89%, indicating a minor reduction in cost efficiency or pricing power. Operating expenses decreased significantly to SGD 108,853 thousand from SGD 132,236 thousand, resulting in a substantial increase in operating income to SGD 51,551 thousand from SGD 23,808 thousand. Operating margin improved to 0.03% from 0.01%, showing better operational profitability. However, net profit decreased slightly to SGD 11,073 thousand from SGD 11,856 thousand, with net profit margin declining to 6.06% from 6.54%, partly due to higher income tax expense (SGD 2,591 thousand vs. SGD 2,421 thousand) and increased interest expense (SGD 3,985 thousand vs. SGD 3,909 thousand). Return on equity was 10.79% and return on assets was 4.21%, indicating reasonable earnings quality and effective use of equity and assets. Overall, profitability improved at the operating level but net earnings slightly declined, suggesting some pressure from financing and tax costs. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost control improved in 2024 with cost of goods sold decreasing to SGD 20,428 thousand from SGD 21,319 thousand, and operating expenses reduced to SGD 105,886 thousand from SGD 108,853 thousand. Asset turnover increased to 71.36% from 69.48%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue.

Net cash from operations increased substantially to SGD 40,098 thousand from SGD 33,260 thousand, demonstrating stronger cash generation from core business activities. Working capital improved as current assets rose and current liabilities declined, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency in 2024 improved through tighter cost control, better asset utilization, and stronger cash flow from operations. | The company demonstrated improved operational efficiency in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased to SGD 21,319 thousand from SGD 25,170 thousand, contributing to higher gross profit despite marginal revenue growth. Operating expenses were significantly reduced by approximately 17.7% to SGD 108,853 thousand, indicating effective cost control. Asset turnover was 69.48%, reflecting efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations remained stable at SGD 33,260 thousand compared to SGD 33,550 thousand in 2022, showing consistent cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased slightly to SGD 11,812 thousand from SGD 11,091 thousand, which may indicate a modest buildup in stock. Working capital remained strong with current assets exceeding current liabilities, supporting operational liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities improved with lower outflows of SGD 6,955 thousand versus SGD 10,995 thousand, suggesting more disciplined investment spending. Overall, the company maintained strong operational efficiency with good cost management, asset utilization, and stable operating cash flow. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage risk decreased in 2024 as evidenced by a lower debt to equity ratio of 128.35% compared to 151.27% in 2023, reflecting reduced total liabilities and increased equity. Liquidity risk is mitigated by an improved current ratio of 264.26% from 242.12%, indicating ample short-term asset coverage for liabilities. Interest expense decreased to SGD 3,724 thousand from SGD 3,985 thousand, and interest coverage improved to 1.46% from 1.29%, suggesting better ability to meet interest obligations. The effective tax rate declined significantly to 11.43% from 18.96%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment but also reduces tax-related risk. No negative cash flow trends or significant increases in liabilities were observed. Overall, financial risk indicators show improvement with reduced leverage, stronger liquidity, and better interest coverage in 2024. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show moderate improvement but some cautionary signals. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 151.27% from 161.53%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. The current ratio remained robust at 242.12%, supporting strong short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased slightly to SGD 3,985 thousand from SGD 3,909 thousand, while interest coverage improved to 1.29% from 0.61%, suggesting better ability to service debt though coverage remains low, indicating some vulnerability to interest rate or earnings volatility. The effective tax rate increased to 18.96% from 16.96%, which could impact net profitability. Net profit margin declined slightly, and net profit decreased despite higher operating income, highlighting potential risks from financing costs and tax burden. The company’s cash flow from financing activities was negative at SGD 32,010 thousand, reflecting significant outflows possibly related to debt repayments or dividends. Overall, while leverage and liquidity improved, the low interest coverage ratio and increased tax rate warrant monitoring for financial risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity in 2024 shows a slight reduction in net cash used in investing activities to SGD (6,307) thousand from SGD (6,955) thousand in 2023, indicating continued but moderated capital expenditure or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow to SGD (33,442) thousand from SGD (32,010) thousand, driven by higher dividend payments of SGD (8,804) thousand compared to SGD (7,193) thousand, suggesting a shareholder-friendly dividend policy. The net increase in cash was positive at SGD 349 thousand versus a decrease in 2023, indicating improved cash flow sustainability. Revenue growth in Malaysia and stable core dental business revenue suggest geographic diversification benefits, although the decline in other businesses and Singapore revenue may require strategic focus. Overall, the company appears positioned for stable future financial performance with sustainable cash flows, ongoing investment, and a commitment to dividends, supported by improved operational and financial metrics. | Looking ahead, Q & M Dental Group’s future financial performance appears cautiously optimistic. The company reduced investing cash outflows to SGD 6,955 thousand from SGD 10,995 thousand, indicating more selective capital expenditure which may preserve cash. However, net cash from financing activities was significantly negative at SGD 32,010 thousand, coupled with a reduced dividend payout of SGD 7,193 thousand from SGD 13,152 thousand, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy and possible debt repayment focus. Revenue concentration remains heavily weighted towards Singapore (SGD 171,438 thousand), with declining contributions from Malaysia and China, which may limit geographic diversification but also reflects focus on core markets. The stable operating cash flow and improved operating margins support sustainability of operations. Given the strong liquidity, moderate leverage, and disciplined investment, the company is positioned for steady financial performance, though growth may be constrained by geographic concentration and external tax and interest cost pressures. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks related to economic conditions and industry trends that affect forecasted revenue growth and profit margins, which impact the impairment assessment of goodwill and investments in associates. Competition and demand volatility are implied through the strategic focus on regional organic and inorganic growth, including opening new clinics and exploring mergers and acquisitions in Singapore, Malaysia, and China.
