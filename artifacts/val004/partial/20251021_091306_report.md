# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue showed a slight decline from 2022 to 2023 by 0.82% (SGD 181,214k to SGD 182,723k) and further decreased by 1.14% from 2023 to 2024 (SGD 182,723k to SGD 180,674k), indicating a relatively flat revenue trend over the three years. Gross margin remained exceptionally high and stable, with 112.94% in 2023 and 112.45% in 2024, suggesting cost of goods sold is significantly lower than revenue or possible accounting classification effects. Revenue by product/service shifted notably: in 2024, the core dental business dominated with £173.8m, replacing the more diversified 2023 mix of primary healthcare (£167.8m), dental equipment and supplies distribution (£8.4m), and medical laboratory (£6.5m). This indicates a strategic focus or reclassification towards the dental business. Geographic revenue distribution remained heavily concentrated in Singapore (~£167m each year), with Malaysia showing a slight increase from £11.1m in 2023 to £13.4m in 2024, while China's contribution diminished to negligible levels (£0.2m in 2023 to none reported in 2024). This suggests stable core markets with minor regional shifts. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin data is unavailable, limiting direct margin trend analysis. However, operating expenses slightly decreased from SGD 139,739k in 2023 to SGD 138,970k in 2024, a 0.54% reduction, despite a small revenue decline, indicating modest cost management efforts. The relationship between operating income and revenue cannot be precisely assessed due to missing operating income figures. Net profit margin improved from 6.06% in 2023 to 7.23% in 2024, reflecting enhanced bottom-line efficiency despite flat revenue, likely driven by controlled operating expenses and lower tax burden. Overall, operational performance shows slight improvement in profitability ratios, suggesting better cost control or operational leverage. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased significantly from 18.96% in 2023 to 11.43% in 2024, contributing positively to net profit margin improvement. Income tax expense also declined from SGD 2,591k in 2023 to SGD 1,686k in 2024, despite similar pre-tax earnings implied by stable net profits. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors impacting profitability appear limited, with tax rate changes being the primary external influence enhancing net profitability in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a solid financial position with total assets of SGD 247,773 thousand, a decrease from SGD 258,588 thousand in 2023, primarily due to a reduction in non-current assets from SGD 177,996 thousand to SGD 163,712 thousand. Current assets increased to SGD 84,061 thousand from SGD 80,592 thousand, indicating improved short-term asset liquidity. Total liabilities decreased significantly to SGD 139,266 thousand from SGD 155,677 thousand, driven by reductions in both current liabilities (SGD 31,810 thousand vs. SGD 33,286 thousand) and non-current liabilities (SGD 107,456 thousand vs. SGD 122,391 thousand). Shareholders' equity strengthened to SGD 108,507 thousand from SGD 102,911 thousand, supported by an increase in retained earnings to SGD 33,674 thousand. The current ratio improved to 264.26% from 242.12%, reflecting enhanced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio declined to 128.35% from 151.27%, indicating better leverage management and a stronger equity base. Overall, the balance sheet reflects improved capital structure, reduced leverage, and enhanced liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, the company shows a slightly weakened overall financial position compared to 2022, with total assets decreasing from SGD 267,412K to SGD 258,588K, reflecting a contraction of approximately 3.3%. Both current assets and non-current assets declined, indicating a reduction in asset base. Total liabilities also decreased from SGD 165,164K to SGD 155,677K, a reduction of about 5.7%, driven by decreases in both current and non-current liabilities. Shareholders' equity increased marginally from SGD 102,248K to SGD 102,911K, supported by a rise in retained earnings from SGD 24,163K to SGD 27,841K, indicating some internal capital accumulation. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, slightly declined from 250.36% to 242.12%, but remains strong, suggesting the company maintains a solid short-term liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio improved from 161.53% to 151.27%, indicating a modest reduction in leverage and a stronger equity buffer relative to debt. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a stable capital structure with cautious liability management and moderate asset contraction in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue slightly decreased to SGD 180,674 thousand in 2024 from SGD 182,723 thousand in 2023, a marginal decline of about 1.1%. Cost of goods sold also decreased to SGD 22,488 thousand from SGD 23,638 thousand, maintaining a high gross margin of 112.45%, slightly lower than 112.94% in 2023. Operating expenses were stable at SGD 138,970 thousand compared to SGD 139,739 thousand. Net profit increased notably by 17.9% to SGD 13,066 thousand from SGD 11,073 thousand, supported by higher income before taxes (SGD 14,752 thousand vs. SGD 13,664 thousand) and a significant reduction in income tax expense to SGD 1,686 thousand from SGD 2,591 thousand, lowering the effective tax rate to 11.43% from 18.96%. Net profit margin improved to 7.23% from 6.06%, indicating enhanced earnings quality. Return on equity rose to 12.36% from 10.79%, and return on assets increased to 5.16% from 4.21%, reflecting better profitability and efficient use of equity and assets. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved in 2024 despite slightly lower revenue. | Revenue in 2023 increased marginally by 0.8% to SGD 182,723K from SGD 181,214K in 2022, indicating stable top-line performance. However, net profit declined by 6.6% to SGD 11,073K from SGD 11,856K, reflecting some pressure on profitability. The net profit margin decreased from 6.54% to 6.06%, signaling slightly lower earnings quality relative to revenue. Income before taxes also fell from SGD 14,277K to SGD 13,664K, while income tax expense increased from SGD 2,421K to SGD 2,591K, resulting in an effective tax rate rise from 16.96% to 18.96%, which negatively impacted net earnings. Interest expense nearly doubled from SGD 2,054K to SGD 3,985K, further compressing profitability. Gross margin is reported at an unusually high 112.94% in 2023, which may indicate accounting or classification nuances but cannot be fully interpreted without 2022 data. Return on equity stands at 10.79% and return on assets at 4.21%, suggesting moderate returns on invested capital but a slight decline in earnings sustainability given the profit drop. Overall, profitability in 2023 shows stable revenue but margin compression due to higher costs and interest expenses. |
| Operational efficiency | The company maintained strong cost control with operating expenses nearly flat year-over-year. Asset turnover improved to 71.36% from 69.48%, indicating more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased significantly to SGD 40,098 thousand from SGD 33,260 thousand, reflecting strong operational cash flow generation. Inventories decreased to SGD 10,587 thousand from SGD 11,812 thousand, suggesting improved inventory management. The current ratio increased to 264.26%, supporting good short-term liquidity. Despite a slight revenue decline, operational efficiency improved through better asset utilization and stronger cash flow from operations, supporting sustainable working capital management. | Operating expenses in 2023 were SGD 139,739K, with no comparative data for 2022, limiting trend analysis. Cost of goods sold is SGD 23,638K in 2023, with no 2022 data available. The asset turnover ratio is 69.48%, indicating that the company generates SGD 0.6948 in revenue for every SGD 1 of assets, which suggests moderate asset utilization efficiency. Net cash from operations slightly decreased from SGD 33,550K in 2022 to SGD 33,260K in 2023, showing stable operational cash flow generation. Inventories increased modestly from SGD 11,091K to SGD 11,812K, which may indicate slightly higher stock levels. Working capital remains strong given the current ratio above 2.4. Overall, operational efficiency appears stable with consistent cash flow from operations and reasonable asset utilization, though cost control impact cannot be fully assessed due to missing operating margin data. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage risk decreased as evidenced by a lower debt to equity ratio of 128.35% compared to 151.27% in 2023, reflecting reduced reliance on debt financing. Interest expense declined to SGD 3,724 thousand from SGD 3,985 thousand, easing interest burden. Although interest coverage ratio is not provided, the increase in income before taxes and lower interest expense suggest improved ability to cover interest costs. The effective tax rate dropped significantly to 11.43% from 18.96%, reducing tax-related risk and increasing net profitability. Liquidity risk is low with a strong current ratio of 264.26%. No other explicit risk indicators are noted. Overall, financial risk profile improved in 2024 with reduced leverage, lower interest expense, and enhanced liquidity. | Leverage indicators improved in 2023 with the debt to equity ratio decreasing from 161.53% to 151.27%, reflecting reduced reliance on debt financing. However, interest expense nearly doubled to SGD 3,985K, which could signal increased borrowing costs or higher debt levels in short term despite overall liability reduction. Interest coverage ratio is unavailable, limiting assessment of the company's ability to service debt from operating income. Liquidity remains strong with a current ratio of 242.12%, though slightly lower than 2022. The effective tax rate increased to 18.96%, which may impact net profitability and cash flows. No data on contingent liabilities or off-balance sheet risks is provided. Overall, financial risk is moderate with improved leverage but rising interest expenses warrant monitoring for potential pressure on earnings and cash flow. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a slight reduction in net cash used for investing at SGD (6,307) thousand compared to SGD (6,955) thousand in 2023, indicating continued but moderated capital expenditure or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow to SGD (33,442) thousand from SGD (32,010) thousand, driven partly by higher dividends paid (SGD 8,804 thousand vs. SGD 7,193 thousand), suggesting a shareholder-friendly dividend policy but increased financing cash outflows. The net increase in cash was positive at SGD 349 thousand versus a decrease in 2023, indicating improved cash flow sustainability. Revenue by geographic region shows a slight decline in Singapore revenue to £167.3m from £171.4m but growth in Malaysia to £13.4m from £11.1m, suggesting potential growth opportunities in Malaysia. The core dental business revenue increased to £173.8m from £167.8m in primary healthcare, indicating a strategic focus on dental segments. Overall, the company appears positioned for stable future performance with ongoing investments, sustainable cash flows, and growth potential in select markets. | Investment activities in 2023 show a reduction in net cash used for investing from SGD (10,995)K in 2022 to SGD (6,955)K, indicating a more conservative capital expenditure or asset acquisition approach. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow to SGD (32,010)K from SGD (30,468)K, with dividends paid decreasing significantly from SGD (13,152)K to SGD (7,193)K, suggesting a more cautious dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue by product/service shows a decline in dental equipment and medical laboratory segments, while primary healthcare revenue increased, indicating a strategic focus or stronger performance in primary healthcare. Geographically, revenue from Singapore increased, while Malaysia and China revenues declined, highlighting concentration risk but also growth in the core Singapore market. Cash flow from operations remains stable, supporting sustainability. Overall, the company appears to be focusing on core markets and segments with prudent investment and dividend policies, positioning for steady but cautious future growth. |
