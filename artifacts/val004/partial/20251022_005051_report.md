# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue increased slightly by 0.83% from SGD 181,214K to SGD 182,723K, then decreased marginally by 1.14% to SGD 180,674K in 2024, indicating relatively flat top-line growth over the three years. Gross profit rose from SGD 156,044K in 2022 to SGD 161,404K in 2023 (+3.38%) but then declined slightly to SGD 160,246K in 2024 (-0.72%). Gross margin percentages show a slight downward trend from 113.89% in 2022 to 111.67% in 2023 and 111.31% in 2024, suggesting a minor erosion in cost efficiency or pricing power despite stable gross profits. Revenue by product/service shifted notably: in 2024, the core dental business dominated with SGD 173,787K, while other businesses contributed SGD 6,887K. In contrast, 2023 and 2022 revenues were more diversified across primary healthcare, dental equipment and supplies distribution, and medical laboratory segments, with a clear reduction in dental equipment and medical laboratory revenues by 2024. This indicates a strategic consolidation or focus on the core dental business. Geographically, Singapore remained the primary revenue source, stable around SGD 167,000K to SGD 171,438K, while Malaysia's contribution fluctuated slightly but remained around SGD 11,000K to SGD 13,355K. Revenue from China declined to zero in 2024 from SGD 169K in 2023 and SGD 787K in 2022, indicating a withdrawal or exit from that market. Overall, revenue and direct cost dynamics reflect a stable but slightly contracting revenue base with a strategic focus on core dental services and geographic concentration in Singapore and Malaysia. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased significantly from SGD 23,757K in 2022 to SGD 30,266K in 2023 (+27.38%) but then decreased to SGD 29,252K in 2024 (-3.37%). Operating expenses remained relatively stable but slightly decreased from SGD 132,287K in 2022 to SGD 131,138K in 2023 and SGD 130,994K in 2024, indicating effective cost containment. Operating margin percentages were very low but improved slightly from 0.01% in 2022 to 0.02% in both 2023 and 2024, reflecting marginal improvements in operational efficiency relative to revenue. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that despite flat revenue, operating income improved notably in 2023, suggesting better cost management or operational leverage, though this gain slightly reversed in 2024. Overall, the company demonstrates stable operating efficiency with tight control over operating expenses, but the very low operating margins highlight limited profitability at the operating level, possibly due to high fixed costs or competitive pressures. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from (16.96%) in 2022 to (18.96%) in 2023 and further to (11.43%) in 2024, indicating a reduction in tax expense relative to pre-tax income, which positively impacted net profitability. Income tax expense decreased from SGD 2,421K in 2022 to SGD 2,591K in 2023 and further to SGD 1,686K in 2024, consistent with the declining effective tax rate. Net profit increased from SGD 11,856K in 2022 to SGD 11,073K in 2023 and then rose to SGD 13,066K in 2024, reflecting improved bottom-line performance despite flat revenue. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the data provided. External factors affecting profitability include the exit from the China market by 2024, which may have reduced exposure to that region's risks but also eliminated a small revenue source. The reduction in tax rate and stable cost management appear to be key external and one-off factors supporting improved net profit margins, which increased from 6.54% in 2022 to 7.23% in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a solid financial position with total assets of SGD 247,773 thousand, a decrease from SGD 258,588 thousand in 2023, primarily due to a reduction in non-current assets from SGD 177,996 thousand to SGD 163,712 thousand. Current assets increased to SGD 84,061 thousand from SGD 80,592 thousand, indicating improved short-term asset liquidity.

The debt to equity ratio improved to 151.27% from 161.53%, signaling a healthier capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company demonstrated balanced asset growth, prudent liability management, and a stable equity base in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue slightly decreased to SGD 180,674 thousand in 2024 from SGD 182,723 thousand in 2023, a marginal decline.

Gross margin remained stable at 111.31% compared to 111.67% in 2023. Operating income decreased to SGD 29,252 thousand from SGD 30,266 thousand, with operating margin steady at 0.02%. However, net profit improved to SGD 13,066 thousand from SGD 11,073 thousand, increasing the net profit margin to 7.23% from 6.06%. Income before taxes rose to SGD 14,752 thousand from SGD 13,664 thousand, while income tax expense decreased significantly to SGD 1,686 thousand from SGD 2,591 thousand, lowering the effective tax rate to 11.43% from 18.96%. Return on equity improved to 12.36% from 10.79%, and return on assets increased to 5.16% from 4.21%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and sustainability. Overall, despite a slight revenue decline, profitability improved due to better cost control, tax efficiency, and higher net margins. | Revenue in 2023 increased slightly to SGD 182,723 thousand from SGD 181,214 thousand in 2022, showing stable top-line performance. Gross profit improved to SGD 161,404 thousand from SGD 156,044 thousand, supported by a reduction in cost of goods sold to SGD 21,319 thousand from SGD 25,170 thousand, enhancing gross margin to 111.67% from 113.89% (noting a slight margin contraction). Operating income rose significantly to SGD 30,266 thousand from SGD 23,757 thousand, reflecting better control over operating expenses which decreased slightly to SGD 131,138 thousand from SGD 132,287 thousand. However, net profit declined to SGD 11,073 thousand from SGD 11,856 thousand, with net profit margin decreasing to 6.06% from 6.54%, partly due to higher interest expenses (SGD 3,985 thousand vs. SGD 2,054 thousand) and increased income tax expense (SGD 2,591 thousand vs. SGD 2,421 thousand). Return on equity was 10.79% and return on assets was 4.21%, indicating moderate earnings quality and reasonable returns relative to equity and asset bases. The effective tax rate increased to 18.96% from 16.96%, slightly impacting net profitability. Overall, profitability showed mixed trends with improved operating income but pressure on net earnings due to higher financing costs and taxes. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses were well controlled, decreasing slightly to SGD 130,994 thousand from SGD 131,138 thousand in 2023, supporting a stable operating margin. Asset turnover improved to 71.36% from 69.48%, indicating more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased significantly to SGD 40,098 thousand from SGD 33,260 thousand, reflecting strong cash generation capability. Inventories decreased to SGD 10,587 thousand from SGD 11,812 thousand, suggesting improved inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities decreased, contributing to a higher current ratio of 264.26%. These factors collectively demonstrate enhanced operational efficiency and effective cost and asset management in 2024. | The company demonstrated improved operational efficiency in 2023. Operating margin doubled to 0.02% from 0.01%, reflecting better cost control despite a slight increase in operating expenses. Asset turnover was 69.48%, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations remained stable at SGD 33,260 thousand compared to SGD 33,550 thousand in 2022, supporting consistent cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased slightly to SGD 11,812 thousand from SGD 11,091 thousand, which may indicate a modest buildup in stock levels. Working capital remained strong with current assets comfortably exceeding current liabilities. Overall, the company maintained steady operational cash flows and improved asset utilization, supporting efficient business operations in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage risk decreased as evidenced by a lower debt to equity ratio of 128.35% in 2024 compared to 151.27% in 2023, indicating reduced reliance on debt financing. Interest expense declined to SGD 3,724 thousand from SGD 3,985 thousand, and interest coverage ratio improved slightly to 0.79% from 0.76%, suggesting marginally better ability to cover interest obligations. Liquidity risk is mitigated by an improved current ratio of 264.26%, up from 242.12%, indicating strong short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate dropped significantly to 11.43% from 18.96%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment but also introduces some variability in tax expense. Overall, financial risk indicators show improvement with reduced leverage, better liquidity, and stable interest coverage, though the low interest coverage ratio remains a point to monitor. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest moderate leverage and liquidity risk. The debt to equity ratio improved to 151.27% from 161.53%, indicating reduced reliance on debt financing relative to equity. However, interest expense nearly doubled to SGD 3,985 thousand from SGD 2,054 thousand, adversely affecting interest coverage which worsened to 0.76% from 1.16%, signaling potential challenges in meeting interest obligations comfortably. The current ratio remained strong at 242.12%, indicating good short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate increased to 18.96%, which could impact net profitability. No significant changes in working capital or cash flow from operations were noted that would raise immediate liquidity concerns. Overall, while leverage has improved, the increased interest burden and lower interest coverage ratio warrant monitoring for financial risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a slight reduction in net cash used in investing activities to SGD (6,307) thousand from SGD (6,955) thousand, indicating continued but moderated investment spending. Net cash used in financing activities increased to SGD (33,442) thousand from SGD (32,010) thousand, with dividends paid rising to SGD (8,804) thousand from SGD (7,193) thousand, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns.

Geographically, revenue from Malaysia increased to SGD 13,355 thousand from SGD 11,116 thousand, while Singapore revenue decreased slightly to SGD 167,319 thousand from SGD 171,438 thousand; China revenue was not reported in 2024. These trends suggest growth potential in Malaysia and a strategic emphasis on core dental business, supporting positive future financial performance. | Investment activities in 2023 showed reduced cash outflows from investing at SGD (6,955) thousand compared to SGD (10,995) thousand in 2022, suggesting a more conservative investment approach or completion of major capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow to SGD (32,010) thousand from SGD (30,468) thousand, with dividends paid decreasing significantly to SGD (7,193) thousand from SGD (13,152) thousand, indicating a more cautious dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue by product/service showed growth in primary healthcare to SGD 167,765 thousand from SGD 160,895 thousand, while dental equipment and medical laboratory revenues declined, signaling a shift in business segment performance. Geographically, Singapore revenue increased to SGD 171,438 thousand from SGD 167,288 thousand, while Malaysia and China revenues declined, suggesting concentration in the Singapore market. The stable operational cash flow and reduced investing outflows support cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company appears focused on consolidating core markets and managing cash prudently, which may support steady future financial performance. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The company faces economic challenges related to uncertainties in future market and economic conditions impacting key assumptions such as forecasted revenue growth and profit margins, which affect goodwill impairment assessments. There are cost pressures and operational challenges from ceasing the medical laboratory business due to expiry of its clinical laboratory service licence in September 2024, impacting short-term profitability. Financial risks include exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt instruments, foreign currency risks (though not material currently), credit risk from counterparties, and liquidity risk in meeting financial liabilities. Management must exercise significant judgement in estimating income tax liabilities, recoverability of profit guarantee receivables secured by pledged shares whose market value has declined, and allowance for impairment on inventories and trade receivables, all of which could materially affect financial outcomes. The company also manages a high debt-to-adjusted capital ratio (74.7% in 2024), which, while improved from 2023, indicates ongoing leverage and capital structure risks. Macroeconomic factors such as inflation and interest rate changes indirectly influence finance costs and borrowing costs. Overall, economic uncertainties and cost pressures require careful management to sustain revenue and profitability. | The Group faces challenging macroeconomic conditions characterized by geopolitical instability, high interest rate environment, and significant inflationary pressures.

The Group is exposed to credit risk from financial assets and counterparty defaults, requiring ongoing credit evaluations and expected credit loss allowances. Foreign currency risk exists due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currency, though its impact on profit is not significant. The Group also faces liquidity risk but maintains undrawn borrowing facilities to meet operational needs. Management exercises significant judgment in assessing impairment of goodwill, investments, and receivables, with potential material adjustments if assumptions change. The uncertain economic environment and cost pressures could affect revenue and profitability, though no material uncertainties threaten the Group's near-term operational existence. Additionally, the Group is managing financial covenants related to shareholders' equity and debt ratios, which could be impacted by adverse economic conditions. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The company faces competitive pressures from established industry players and new market entrants as it pursues regional expansion and technological innovation.
