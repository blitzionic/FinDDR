# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, Q & M Dental Group's revenue showed a slight fluctuation, starting at SGD 181,214 thousand in 2022, increasing to SGD 182,723 thousand in 2023, then slightly decreasing to SGD 180,674 thousand in 2024. Despite this, gross profit improved from SGD 156,044 thousand in 2022 to SGD 160,246 thousand in 2024. The gross margin remained strong but showed a slight declining trend from 113.89% in 2022 to 111.31% in 2024. Revenue by product/service indicates a dominant core dental business with SGD 173,787 thousand in 2024, slightly up from SGD 172,960 thousand in 2023, while revenue from other businesses declined from SGD 9,763 thousand in 2023 to SGD 6,887 thousand in 2024. Geographically, Singapore remains the primary market with SGD 167,319 thousand in 2024, a slight decrease from SGD 171,438 thousand in 2023, while Malaysia's revenue increased from SGD 11,116 thousand in 2023 to SGD 13,355 thousand in 2024. Revenue from China was minimal and discontinued by 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased modestly from SGD 52,432 thousand in 2022 to SGD 54,360 thousand in 2024, reflecting stable operating performance. However, operating expenses rose from SGD 103,612 thousand in 2022 to SGD 105,886 thousand in 2024, indicating some cost pressures. The operating margin remained constant at 0.03% across all three years, suggesting that despite revenue and operating income changes, profitability at the operating level was stable but very thin. The ratio of operating income to revenue remained consistent, highlighting steady operational efficiency but limited scalability or margin expansion. Cost management appears challenged as operating expenses increased even with relatively flat revenue, which may warrant further scrutiny. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased significantly from 16.96% in 2022 to 11.43% in 2024, which positively impacted net profit, contributing to an increase in net profit margin from 6.54% in 2022 to 8.10% in 2024. Income tax expense also decreased from SGD 2,421 thousand in 2022 to SGD 1,686 thousand in 2024, supporting higher net profitability. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, indicating that the observed profitability changes are primarily driven by operational and tax rate dynamics. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Q & M Dental Group (Singapore) Limited shows a slight decrease in total assets to SGD 247,773 thousand from SGD 258,588 thousand in 2023, driven primarily by a reduction in non-current assets (SGD 163,712 thousand vs. SGD 177,996 thousand). Current assets increased modestly to SGD 84,061 thousand, improving liquidity. Total liabilities decreased significantly to SGD 139,266 thousand from SGD 155,677 thousand, with both current liabilities (SGD 31,810 thousand) and non-current liabilities (SGD 107,456 thousand) reduced, indicating a stronger balance sheet. Shareholders' equity increased to SGD 108,507 thousand from SGD 102,911 thousand, supported by higher retained earnings (SGD 33,674 thousand vs. SGD 27,841 thousand). The current ratio improved to 264.26% from 242.12%, reflecting enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio declined to 128.35% from 151.27%, indicating a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2024 is stronger with improved liquidity, reduced leverage, and increased equity base despite a slight contraction in total assets. | In 2023, Q & M Dental Group (Singapore) Limited showed a slight decrease in total assets to SGD 258,588 thousand from SGD 267,412 thousand in 2022, driven by reductions in both current assets (SGD 80,592 thousand vs. SGD 81,803 thousand) and non-current assets (SGD 177,996 thousand vs. SGD 185,609 thousand).

Liquidity remains strong with a current ratio of 242.12%, slightly lower than 250.36% in 2022, indicating ample short-term asset coverage of liabilities. The capital structure improved with a reduced debt-to-equity ratio of 151.27% from 161.53%, reflecting a modest deleveraging trend and a more balanced financing mix between debt and equity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue slightly decreased to SGD 180,674 thousand in 2024 from SGD 182,723 thousand in 2023, mainly due to a decline in other businesses revenue (SGD 6,887 thousand vs. SGD 9,763 thousand) and Singapore revenue (SGD 167,319 thousand vs. SGD 171,438 thousand), partially offset by growth in Malaysia (SGD 13,355 thousand vs. SGD 11,116 thousand). Gross profit marginally declined to SGD 160,246 thousand from SGD 161,404 thousand, with gross margin slightly down to 111.31% from 111.67%, indicating stable cost of goods sold control. Operating income increased to SGD 54,360 thousand from SGD 52,551 thousand, improving operating margin slightly but remaining at 0.03%. Net profit rose significantly to SGD 14,637 thousand from SGD 11,517 thousand, lifting net profit margin to 8.10% from 6.30%, reflecting better bottom-line efficiency. Return on equity improved to 13.85% from 11.23%, and return on assets increased to 5.78% from 4.38%, demonstrating enhanced earnings quality and effective use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate decreased to 11.43% from 18.96%, contributing to higher net profitability. Interest expense reduced slightly, improving interest coverage ratio to 1.01 from 0.93. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved in 2024 despite a slight revenue dip, driven by better cost management, tax efficiency, and operational leverage. | Revenue in 2023 increased slightly to SGD 182,723 thousand from SGD 181,214 thousand in 2022, while gross profit improved to SGD 161,404 thousand from SGD 156,044 thousand, despite a decrease in cost of goods sold to SGD 21,319 thousand from SGD 25,170 thousand. Gross margin declined slightly to 111.67% from 113.89%, indicating a minor compression in profitability at the gross level. Operating income remained stable at SGD 52,551 thousand compared to SGD 52,432 thousand, with operating margin steady at 0.03%. Net profit decreased marginally to SGD 11,517 thousand from SGD 11,856 thousand, resulting in a net profit margin decline to 6.30% from 6.54%. Return on equity was reported at 11.23% and return on assets at 4.38%, providing a measure of moderate profitability and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased to 18.96% from 16.96%, slightly reducing net earnings. Interest expense rose significantly to SGD 5,655 thousand from SGD 3,909 thousand, negatively impacting net profitability and interest coverage ratio, which worsened to 0.93 from 1.34. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost control improved in 2024 with cost of goods sold decreasing to SGD 20,428 thousand from SGD 21,319 thousand and operating expenses reduced to SGD 105,886 thousand from SGD 108,853 thousand, supporting a higher operating income. Asset turnover increased to 71.36% from 69.48%, indicating more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Inventories decreased to SGD 10,587 thousand from SGD 11,812 thousand, suggesting better inventory management. Net cash from operations increased substantially to SGD 40,098 thousand from SGD 33,260 thousand, reflecting stronger cash generation from core business activities. Working capital improved as current assets rose and current liabilities declined, enhancing liquidity and operational flexibility. Cash flow from investing activities remained negative but slightly improved to (SGD 6,307 thousand) from (SGD 6,955 thousand), indicating continued but controlled investment. Financing cash outflows increased to (SGD 33,442 thousand) from (SGD 32,010 thousand), driven by higher dividend payments (SGD 8,804 thousand vs. SGD 7,193 thousand). Overall, operational efficiency improved with better cost control, asset utilization, and stronger operating cash flow generation. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed signals. Operating expenses increased to SGD 108,853 thousand from SGD 103,612 thousand, indicating higher cost pressures. However, cost of goods sold decreased, contributing to improved gross profit. Asset turnover was reported at 69.48%, indicating relatively high revenue generation per unit of asset, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations remained stable at SGD 33,260 thousand, slightly below SGD 33,550 thousand in 2022, reflecting consistent cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased modestly to SGD 11,812 thousand from SGD 11,091 thousand, which may suggest cautious inventory buildup. Working capital remains strong given the high current ratio, supporting operational liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities improved with lower outflows of SGD 6,955 thousand compared to SGD 10,995 thousand, indicating reduced capital expenditure or asset purchases. Financing cash outflows increased to SGD 32,010 thousand from SGD 30,468 thousand, driven by dividend payments and possibly debt servicing. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage risk decreased in 2024 as evidenced by a lower debt to equity ratio of 128.35% compared to 151.27% in 2023, reflecting reduced total liabilities and increased equity. Liquidity risk is mitigated by an improved current ratio of 264.26% from 242.12%, indicating strong short-term liquidity. Interest coverage ratio improved slightly to 1.01 from 0.93, suggesting marginally better ability to cover interest expenses from operating income, though the ratio remains low and warrants monitoring. The effective tax rate declined to 11.43% from 18.96%, reducing tax expense risk. The company’s net cash from operations increased, supporting liquidity and debt servicing capacity. However, the slight decrease in total assets and continued negative cash flow from investing activities may pose medium-term risks if investment returns do not materialize. The concentration of revenue in Singapore (SGD 167,319 thousand) with a small but growing contribution from Malaysia (SGD 13,355 thousand) and absence of China revenue in 2024 may expose the company to geographic concentration risk. Overall, financial risk has moderated but interest coverage and geographic concentration require ongoing attention. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 highlight some concerns. The debt-to-equity ratio improved to 151.27% from 161.53%, signaling reduced leverage but still a relatively high reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased substantially by 44.7% to SGD 5,655 thousand, which, combined with stable operating income, caused the interest coverage ratio to deteriorate to 0.93 from 1.34, indicating potential challenges in meeting interest obligations comfortably. The current ratio remains robust at 242.12%, suggesting low short-term liquidity risk. The effective tax rate increased to 18.96%, which may impact net profitability. No explicit data on contingent liabilities or off-balance sheet risks is provided. Overall, while liquidity is strong, the increased interest burden and high leverage warrant monitoring for financial risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company’s investment activity in 2024 remained negative at (SGD 6,307 thousand), slightly lower than 2023, indicating continued capital expenditure or acquisitions to support future growth. Net cash from operations increased significantly, suggesting sustainable cash flow to fund operations and investments. Dividend payments increased to SGD 8,804 thousand from SGD 7,193 thousand, reflecting a shareholder-friendly dividend policy supported by improved profitability and cash flow. The revenue mix shows a shift with increased contribution from Malaysia and decreased revenue from other businesses and China, indicating potential geographic realignment or strategic focus on core markets. The improved profitability margins, higher retained earnings, and stronger equity base provide a solid foundation for future financial performance. However, the slight decline in total assets and reliance on Singapore and Malaysia markets suggest that geographic diversification and asset base expansion should be strategic priorities. Overall, the company is positioned for stable future performance with sustainable cash flows and prudent investment, but should monitor geographic and asset base risks. | Looking ahead, Q & M Dental Group's 2023 financials suggest cautious optimism. The company generated stable operating cash flows (SGD 33,260 thousand) and reduced investing cash outflows to SGD 6,955 thousand, indicating potentially lower capital expenditure or more efficient investment. Dividend payments decreased significantly to SGD 7,193 thousand from SGD 13,152 thousand, which may reflect a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. Revenue concentration remains heavily weighted towards the core dental business (SGD 172,960 thousand) and Singapore geography (SGD 171,438 thousand), with smaller contributions from Malaysia and China, suggesting limited geographic diversification but strong domestic market presence. The stable asset base and equity position, combined with moderate profitability and improved capital structure, support sustainable financial performance. However, increased interest expenses and modest net profit margin compression highlight the need for careful cost and debt management to maintain cash flow sustainability and support future growth. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks related to economic conditions and industry trends that affect forecasted revenue growth and profit margins, which impact the impairment assessment of goodwill and investments in associates. Competition and demand volatility are implied through clinic consolidations and strategic expansions in Singapore, Malaysia, and China. The Group's legal victory in Malaysia reinforces contractual integrity risks in cross-border ventures. The cessation of the medical laboratory business due to license expiry reflects regulatory and market environment risks. Management monitors market risks through regular reviews and uses valuation specialists to assess assumptions in impairment testing. | The Group faces challenging macroeconomic conditions including geopolitical instability, high interest rate environment, and rising inflation which affect costs for customers and suppliers. There is exposure to foreign currency risk due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currency, though sensitivity analysis indicates the effect on post-tax profit is not significant. Competition and demand volatility are implied by the Group's focus on expanding its network of dental clinics in Singapore, Malaysia, and exploring other Southeast Asian markets. The Group also faces risks related to industry trends and customer behavior, particularly in transitioning from COVID-19 related business to non-COVID-19 activities in its medical laboratory segment. Management regularly reviews market conditions and plausible downside scenarios but has not identified material uncertainties threatening operational existence in the near future. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include challenges from business operations such as the cessation of the medical laboratory business following license expiry, which caused asset impairments and short-term profitability impact. Clinic consolidations and productivity enhancements (e.g., increasing dental chairs) indicate operational adjustments to optimize efficiency. Risks related to supply chain, technology systems, and human resources are managed through internal controls and risk management systems overseen by the Board and Audit Committee.

The Group is also exposed to financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and currency risk, which are managed through established policies but remain inherent uncertainties. The cessation of the medical laboratory business following the expiry of its clinical license and the impact of inflation and cost pressures on employee benefits and other expenses also present economic challenges. The Group's debt-to-adjusted capital ratio, while improved, remains significant, indicating ongoing leverage and associated financial risk. Macroeconomic factors such as regional economic conditions in Southeast Asia and China, where the Group operates and plans expansion, also contribute to economic uncertainties affecting business performance. | The Group faces challenging macroeconomic conditions characterized by geopolitical instability, high interest rate environment, and significant inflationary pressures that increase costs for goods and services from customers and suppliers. The rising interest rates have led to increased finance costs, which rose by 45% in FY2023 due to higher interest expenses. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on floating rate debt instruments and foreign currency risk as part of its normal business operations, although sensitivity analyses indicate these risks have a non-significant effect on post-tax profit. The uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment requires management to consider downside scenarios, although no material uncertainties were identified regarding the Group's operational continuity. Additionally, the Group faces cost pressures including increased employee benefits expense and other expenses such as repair and maintenance and marketing, partly driven by revenue growth in Singapore dental clinics. The Group also manages liquidity risk through undrawn borrowing facilities to support operations and commitments. The impairment of goodwill in the medical laboratory segment reflects uncertainties in transitioning from COVID-19 related activities to non-COVID business, with a higher discount rate applied due to greater uncertainty. The Group also faces risks related to the recoverability of profit guarantee receivables secured by pledged shares, which may be affected by market value declines and the financial ability of the associate's director to repay shortfalls. Overall, economic uncertainties include inflation, interest rate increases, foreign exchange fluctuations, cost pressures, and market conditions impacting revenue and profitability. |
