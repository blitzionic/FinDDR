# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | ISEC Healthcare Ltd.'s revenue showed a consistent upward trend from SGD 62,954,000 in 2022 to SGD 69,994,000 in 2023, and further to SGD 74,197,000 in 2024. Gross profit also increased from SGD 28,800,000 in 2022 to SGD 31,036,000 in 2023 and SGD 32,668,000 in 2024. The gross margin improved significantly from 79.91% in 2022 to over 155% in both 2023 (155.66%) and 2024 (155.97%), indicating a substantial improvement in cost efficiency or pricing power. Revenue by product/service shows that specialised health services dominate, growing from SGD 58,514,000 in 2022 to SGD 70,601,000 in 2024, while general health services declined from SGD 4,440,000 in 2022 to SGD 3,596,000 in 2024. Geographically, Malaysia is the largest revenue contributor, increasing from SGD 49,696,000 in 2022 to SGD 59,597,000 in 2024, followed by Singapore with relatively stable revenue around SGD 11,000,000 to SGD 12,000,000, and Myanmar showing moderate growth from SGD 1,916,000 in 2022 to SGD 2,748,000 in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin decreased from 24.48% in 2023 to 22.48% in 2024 after a dramatic increase from 0.03% in 2022, reflecting a normalization after a very low base year. Operating income declined from SGD 18,500,000 in 2022 to SGD 17,134,000 in 2023 and further to SGD 16,680,000 in 2024, despite revenue growth, indicating rising operating expenses or other cost pressures. Operating expenses increased from SGD 10,300,000 in 2022 to SGD 13,842,000 in 2023 and SGD 15,988,000 in 2024, suggesting cost management challenges as expenses grew faster than revenue. The ratio of operating income to revenue shows a decline in efficiency in 2024 compared to 2023, highlighting the need for tighter cost control to sustain profitability gains. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, slightly increasing from 24.14% in 2022 to 24.98% in 2024, which had a moderate impact on net profit margins that decreased from 20.17% in 2022 to 17.38% in 2024. There are no explicitly listed non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability in the provided data. The steady tax rate and absence of one-off items suggest that profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance rather than external or exceptional events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, ISEC Healthcare Ltd. demonstrated solid financial health with total assets increasing by approximately 11.1% from SGD 107,107,000 in 2023 to SGD 119,046,000. This growth was driven primarily by a significant rise in non-current assets (17.6% increase) to SGD 94,191,000, indicating ongoing investment in long-term resources. Current assets, however, declined by 8% to SGD 24,855,000, which alongside a rise in current liabilities by 15.9% to SGD 16,766,000, contributed to a decrease in the current ratio from 186.75% to 148.25%, signaling a reduction in short-term liquidity though still above 1. The total liabilities increased modestly by 9.5% to SGD 27,307,000, but the debt to equity ratio slightly improved from 30.38% to 29.77%, reflecting a stable and conservative capital structure. Shareholders' equity grew by 11.6% to SGD 91,739,000, supported by a strong increase in retained earnings (35.5% increase to SGD 23,685,000), underscoring the company’s capacity to internally finance growth and absorb liabilities. | In 2023, ISEC Healthcare Ltd. shows a slight decrease in total assets to SGD 107,107 thousand from SGD 110,295 thousand in 2022, driven by reductions in both current assets (SGD 27,021 thousand vs. SGD 27,617 thousand) and non-current assets (SGD 80,086 thousand vs. SGD 82,678 thousand). Total liabilities decreased notably to SGD 24,957 thousand from SGD 28,953 thousand, with both current liabilities (SGD 14,469 thousand vs. SGD 16,096 thousand) and non-current liabilities (SGD 10,488 thousand vs. SGD 12,857 thousand) reduced, indicating improved liability management. Shareholders' equity increased slightly to SGD 82,150 thousand from SGD 81,342 thousand, supported by higher retained earnings (SGD 17,476 thousand vs. SGD 15,054 thousand). The current ratio improved to 186.75% from 171.58%, reflecting enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio declined to 30.38% from 35.59%, indicating a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the company maintains a strong financial position with solid equity base, reduced liabilities, and improved liquidity in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue rose by 6% to SGD 74,197,000 in 2024, driven mainly by a 7.0% increase in specialised health services revenue, partially offset by a 9.7% decline in general health services revenue. Gross profit improved by 5.2% to SGD 32,668,000, maintaining a stable gross margin of 155.97%, slightly higher than 2023’s 155.66%, indicating consistent cost of goods sold management relative to revenue. However, operating income decreased by 2.6% to SGD 16,680,000, with operating margin declining from 24.48% to 22.48%, reflecting increased operating expenses (15.5% rise). Net profit decreased by 1.9% to SGD 12,894,000, with net profit margin contracting from 18.79% to 17.38%. Return on equity and return on assets also declined to 14.83% and 11.40% respectively, down from 16.09% and 12.10%, indicating slightly lower earnings efficiency despite revenue growth. The effective tax rate increased marginally to 24.98%, contributing to the net profit margin compression. Overall, earnings quality remains solid but shows signs of margin pressure due to rising operating costs. | Revenue increased by 11.1% to SGD 69,994 thousand in 2023 from SGD 62,954 thousand in 2022, driven primarily by growth in specialised health services revenue (SGD 66,015 thousand vs. SGD 58,514 thousand), despite a slight decline in general health services revenue. Gross profit rose modestly to SGD 31,036 thousand from SGD 28,800 thousand, resulting in an unusually high gross margin of 155.66% compared to 79.91% in 2022, which suggests possible data irregularities or accounting reclassifications in cost of goods sold (notably negative COGS in 2023). Operating income decreased slightly to SGD 17,134 thousand from SGD 18,500 thousand, but operating margin improved significantly to 24.48% from 0.03%, indicating better control over operating expenses despite reported negative operating expenses. Net profit increased marginally to SGD 13,150 thousand from SGD 12,700 thousand, with net profit margin slightly lower at 18.79% from 20.17%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 are 16.09% and 12.10% respectively, indicating efficient use of equity and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate is negative at -24.05%, reversing from a positive 24.14% in 2022, which may reflect tax credits or adjustments. Overall, profitability shows improvement in margins and returns, but some anomalies in cost and tax figures warrant further review for earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2024. The asset turnover ratio improved from 64.39% to 65.62%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased modestly by 2.7% to SGD 17,642,000, supporting operational cash flow strength. Inventories rose by 11.9% to SGD 2,501,000, which may suggest higher stock levels possibly to support increased specialised services. However, the increase in operating expenses outpaced revenue growth, which impacted operating income negatively. Working capital management appears slightly tighter given the decrease in current assets and increase in current liabilities, reflected in the lower current ratio. Cash flow from investing activities more than doubled in outflow to SGD (12,780,000), indicating significant capital expenditure or investments, which may affect short-term liquidity but could support future growth. Financing cash outflows decreased by 19.3% to SGD (9,129,000), with dividends paid down by 37.3% to SGD (6,615,000), suggesting a more conservative dividend policy or retention of cash for investment. | Operational efficiency in 2023 shows mixed signals. The company’s asset turnover ratio is exceptionally high at 64.39, indicating extremely efficient use of assets to generate revenue, though this figure is unusually large and may reflect data inconsistencies. Net cash from operations slightly decreased to SGD 17,171 thousand from SGD 17,848 thousand in 2022, indicating stable but slightly reduced cash generation from core operations. Inventories increased to SGD 2,235 thousand from SGD 1,874 thousand, which may suggest buildup of stock or slower inventory turnover. Operating expenses are reported as negative (SGD -13,842 thousand), which is unusual and may indicate reclassification or accounting adjustments. Cash flow from investing activities improved, with outflows reducing to SGD -6,432 thousand from SGD -11,600 thousand, suggesting lower capital expenditure or asset purchases. Cash flow from financing activities showed increased outflows at SGD -11,305 thousand compared to SGD -7,167 thousand, driven by higher dividend payments (SGD -10,541 thousand vs. SGD -4,398 thousand). Overall, operational cash flow remains solid, but unusual expense and margin figures suggest the need for detailed operational review. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for 2024 show a stable leverage profile with debt to equity ratio slightly improving to 29.77% from 30.38%, indicating no significant increase in financial risk from debt. Interest expense decreased by 7.5% to SGD (602,000), while interest coverage ratio improved markedly to 2770.76% from 2631.95%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest obligations and low risk of default. Liquidity risk increased somewhat as the current ratio declined from 186.75% to 148.25%, driven by a reduction in current assets and increase in current liabilities, which could pressure short-term obligations if the trend continues. The effective tax rate rose slightly to 24.98%, which may marginally impact net profitability. The significant increase in investing cash outflows could strain liquidity if not matched by operational cash inflows. Overall, the company maintains low financial risk but should monitor liquidity and capital expenditure closely. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show reduced leverage and improved liquidity, with debt to equity ratio declining to 30.38% from 35.59% and current ratio increasing to 186.75% from 171.58%, lowering short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense increased slightly to SGD 651 thousand from SGD 555 thousand, but interest coverage ratio is reported as negative (-2631.95%), which is inconsistent with positive operating income and may indicate data or calculation errors. The effective tax rate turned negative (-24.05%) from a positive 24.14%, which could reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces uncertainty in tax expense predictability. The company’s net cash from operations remains strong, mitigating liquidity risk. However, the negative margins and unusual accounting figures in cost and tax expenses suggest potential risks in earnings quality and financial reporting. No significant increase in liabilities or debt is observed, reducing solvency risk. Overall, financial risk appears moderate with strong liquidity and reduced leverage, but anomalies in tax and interest coverage metrics warrant caution. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, ISEC Healthcare Ltd.’s increased investment activity, as evidenced by the doubling of net cash used in investing to SGD (12,780,000), suggests a strategic focus on expanding or upgrading non-current assets, which could enhance future revenue capacity and operational efficiency. The reduction in dividends paid by 37.3% to SGD (6,615,000) indicates a more conservative dividend policy, potentially preserving cash for growth initiatives or debt management. Revenue growth in specialised health services and geographic expansion in Malaysia and Myanmar (with Myanmar revenue increasing by 38.3%) signal promising avenues for future top-line growth. However, the decline in general health services revenue and Singapore revenue may require strategic attention. Sustained positive net cash from operations and stable leverage ratios support cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company appears positioned for moderate growth with prudent financial management, but must balance investment spending with liquidity to maintain financial flexibility. | Looking forward, ISEC Healthcare Ltd. shows potential for sustainable financial performance supported by stable revenue growth, particularly in specialised health services and expanding geographic presence in Malaysia and Singapore. The reduction in investing cash outflows to SGD -6,432 thousand from SGD -11,600 thousand suggests a more conservative investment approach or completion of major capital projects, which may preserve cash. However, increased dividend payments to SGD -10,541 thousand from SGD -4,398 thousand indicate a more aggressive dividend policy that could pressure cash reserves if operational cash flow weakens. The company’s strong liquidity and equity base provide a buffer for future investments or downturns. The high asset turnover ratio, if accurate, suggests efficient asset utilization that could support revenue growth. Given the improved margins and returns, the company is positioned for continued profitability, but the unusual accounting figures and negative tax rate highlight the need for careful monitoring of earnings quality and tax strategy. Geographic revenue growth in Malaysia and Singapore signals potential market expansion opportunities. Overall, the company appears financially stable with positive growth prospects but should maintain prudent cash flow management and address accounting anomalies to ensure sustainable future performance. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | ISEC Healthcare Ltd. faces market risks including competition and rising costs impacting subsidiaries JLMBB and JLMYT, leading to impairment losses due to decreased revenue by 7% and 15% respectively. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk from intergroup balances denominated in Malaysian Ringgit, with sensitivity analyses showing equity impact from exchange rate fluctuations. The Group's outlook is positive due to increasing demand for private eye care services driven by regional affluence, digitalization, and aging populations. Expansion into new markets such as Vietnam and growth in Malaysia are strategic focuses. The Group monitors industry trends and economic conditions to inform revenue growth assumptions in impairment testing. Mitigation includes ongoing investments in market reach, skills, and technology upgrades. | The Group faces market risks including exposure to economic conditions and industry trends impacting the healthcare and ophthalmology sectors in Southeast Asia. Competition is noted from entities such as Aier Eye Hospital Group, which operates in similar business areas but currently has no presence in Southeast Asia outside the Group's operations. Demand volatility and customer behavior risks are implied through the Group's expansion plans into emerging markets like Myanmar, Cambodia, and Vietnam, which have nascent medical eye care industries. The Group manages these risks by prudently exploring expansion opportunities and continuously reviewing competitive conditions, with the Board receiving regular updates on industry and market developments. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include business continuity challenges and day-to-day operational risks managed through a sound system of internal controls and risk management overseen by the Board and Audit Committee.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces economic challenges including inflationary pressures that have led to increased operating costs, particularly noted in Myanmar where fee adjustments were made to reflect higher costs due to inflation. Rising operating costs have adversely affected profitability in Singapore, especially for the general health services segment, contributing to a decline in revenue and an impairment loss for goodwill. The Group also experiences cost pressures from increased staff-related costs, depreciation expenses due to expanded operations and new centres, and higher administrative expenses. Additionally, there is exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings denominated in Malaysian Ringgit with floating rates, which could impact future cash flows. The political situation in Myanmar remains uncertain, posing potential risks to operations there. The Group's financial risk management includes credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, and interest rate risk, with sensitivity analyses indicating potential impacts on profit from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Overall, economic uncertainties such as inflation, cost increases, and geopolitical factors could impact revenue and profitability going forward. | The Group faces economic challenges including exposure to interest rate risks primarily from borrowings at floating rates denominated in Malaysian Ringgit, which could affect future cash flows and financial instrument values. Inflationary pressures have contributed to increased operating costs, leading to a decline in gross profit margin from 45.7% in FY2022 to 44.3% in FY2023 despite revenue growth. The Group is also exposed to credit risks from trade receivables, with significant concentration risk from a few corporate customers representing 58% of total trade receivables. Forward-looking factors such as GDP forecasts are incorporated into expected credit loss assessments, indicating sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions. Liquidity risks exist but are managed through prudent cash flow management and maintaining adequate credit facilities. Political uncertainty in Myanmar, including the extended state of emergency delaying elections, presents operational risks in that market. The Group's expansion plans, including property acquisition and regional growth, may require fund-raising, which could be impacted by economic conditions. Overall, economic uncertainties such as interest rate fluctuations, inflation, credit risk concentration, and geopolitical factors could impact revenue, profitability, and financial stability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Group faces competitive pressures manifested in rising competition and increased costs in Singapore's general health services segment, which has led to decreased revenue and impairment losses for goodwill in subsidiaries JLMBB and JLMYT. The closure of evening clinic sessions at JLMYT resulted in fewer patient visits, indicating challenges in maintaining market share and customer engagement. While the Group benefits from strong demand for specialized eye care services, it operates in a competitive healthcare market with both established players and potential new entrants. The Group actively invests in upgrading skills and technology to remain future-ready and enhance its market position. It also participates in local forums and community events to elevate its profile and educate the public, indicating efforts to counter competitive threats. The presence of Aier Eye Hospital Group Co., Ltd., a major shareholder with similar business interests, is noted, although Aier Group currently has no business in Southeast Asia outside the Group's operations. The Group's strategic expansion and regional footprint growth are responses to competitive industry dynamics and technological disruption. | The Group operates in a competitive healthcare market with pressures from established players and potential new entrants. Notably, there is a conflict of interest risk as key individuals in the Group also hold positions in Aier Eye Hospital Group Co., Ltd., a major industry player with similar business interests, although Aier currently has no business in Southeast Asia outside the Group's operations. The Group faces a highly competitive labor market, necessitating continuous review of staff remuneration and benefits to attract and retain talent, which increases operating costs. Technological advancements and the need for continuous professional development of doctors are critical to maintaining competitive advantage. The Group's strategy to expand its footprint in existing and new markets, including emerging markets like Cambodia and Vietnam, reflects the need to stay ahead amid industry dynamics. The acquisition of larger premises and investment in state-of-the-art equipment aim to enhance service capacity and quality to counter competitive threats. However, ongoing legal disputes and operational challenges could distract management focus and affect market positioning. Overall, competitive pressures stem from industry incumbents, talent competition, technological demands, and the need for strategic expansion to sustain market position. |
