The gross margin showed a slight increase from 155.66% in 2023 to 155.97% in 2024, indicating improved profitability per unit of revenue. Revenue by product/service indicates a strong focus on specialised health services, which grew from $66,015 in 2023 to $70,601 in 2024, while general health services saw a decline from $3,979 to $3,596. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia increased from $55,960 in 2023 to $59,597 in 2024, while Singapore's revenue slightly decreased from $12,047 to $11,852, and Myanmar's revenue increased from $1,987 to $2,748, suggesting a shift in focus towards the Malaysian market. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin data is not available for the years analyzed. However, the relationship between operating income and revenue cannot be assessed due to missing operating income figures. Operating expenses increased from $13,842 in 2023 to $15,908 in 2024, which may indicate rising costs that could affect future profitability if not managed effectively. The net profit margin decreased from 20.22% in 2022 to 18.79% in 2023 and further to 17.38% in 2024, suggesting a decline in overall operational efficiency and profitability despite revenue growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased slightly from 24.05% in 2023 to 24.98% in 2024, which may impact net profitability. Income tax expenses rose from $4,164 in 2023 to $4,293 in 2024, reflecting the increased revenue but also a higher tax burden. There are no specific non-recurring items mentioned in the data, but the overall trend of increasing tax expenses alongside declining net profit margins suggests external pressures that could be affecting profitability. |

| Future financial performance projection | Based on 2024 data, the company is positioned for continued growth with revenue projected to increase further, supported by strong performance in specialized health services. However, rising operational costs and a declining net profit margin may pressure profitability.

The dividend policy remains robust, with dividends of SGD 6,615,000, although lower than the previous year. | In 2023, the company showed potential for future growth with revenue growth trends and a focus on specialized health services. However, the decline in net profit margin and rising operational costs could hinder profitability.
