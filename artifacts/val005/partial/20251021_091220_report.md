# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased steadily from SGD 62,954K in 2022 to SGD 69,994K in 2023 (an 11.15% increase), and further to SGD 74,197K in 2024 (a 5.98% increase from 2023). Gross profit also rose from SGD 28,800K in 2022 to SGD 31,036K in 2023 and SGD 32,668K in 2024, reflecting consistent growth. Gross margin remained remarkably stable and exceptionally high at approximately 155.66% in 2023 and 155.97% in 2024, indicating that gross profit significantly exceeds revenue, which may suggest accounting or classification nuances. Revenue by product/service shows that specialised health services dominate, contributing SGD 70,601K (95.1% of total revenue) in 2024, up from SGD 66,015K in 2023, while general health services declined slightly from SGD 3,979K to SGD 3,596K. Geographically, Malaysia is the primary revenue source, increasing from SGD 55,960K in 2023 to SGD 59,597K in 2024, representing about 80.3% of total revenue in 2024. Singapore's revenue slightly decreased from SGD 12,047K to SGD 11,852K, and Myanmar's revenue grew from SGD 1,987K to SGD 2,748K, indicating regional shifts with Malaysia strengthening its dominance. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses increased from SGD 13,942K in 2023 to SGD 15,908K in 2024, a 14.1% rise, outpacing revenue growth of 5.98% in the same period, suggesting some deterioration in cost control. Operating income data is unavailable, preventing direct calculation of operating margin trends. However, net profit margin declined from 20.17% in 2022 to 18.79% in 2023 and further to 17.38% in 2024, indicating reduced profitability relative to revenue. This margin compression, despite revenue growth, implies that operating efficiency has weakened, likely due to rising operating expenses and possibly other cost pressures. The relationship between operating income and revenue cannot be precisely analyzed due to missing data, but the net profit margin trend signals challenges in maintaining operational profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased modestly from 24.14% in 2022 to 24.05% in 2023 and further to 24.98% in 2024, indicating a slight upward pressure on tax expenses relative to pre-tax income. Income tax expense rose from SGD 4,050K in 2022 to SGD 4,164K in 2023 and SGD 4,293K in 2024, consistent with rising profits but also reflecting the higher effective tax rate in 2024. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the provided financials. External factors affecting profitability are not detailed, but the steady increase in tax rate and operating expenses may reflect regulatory or market conditions impacting costs and net profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from SGD 107,107K in 2023 to SGD 119,046K, reflecting asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from SGD 80,086K to SGD 94,191K. Current assets decreased slightly from SGD 27,021K to SGD 24,855K, which contributed to a lower current ratio of 148.25% compared to 186.75% in 2023, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity. Total liabilities increased moderately from SGD 24,957K to SGD 27,307K, with current liabilities rising from SGD 14,469K to SGD 16,766K and non-current liabilities remaining relatively stable. Shareholders' equity strengthened significantly from SGD 82,150K to SGD 91,739K, supported by an increase in retained earnings from SGD 17,476K to SGD 23,685K, indicating strong equity growth and a healthy capital base. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 29.77% from 30.38%, suggesting effective liability management and a stable capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth in asset base and equity, with manageable increases in liabilities, though liquidity has somewhat decreased. | In 2023, the company maintained a strong financial position with total assets of SGD 107,107 thousand, slightly lower than SGD 110,295 thousand in 2022, indicating a modest contraction in asset base. Total liabilities decreased from SGD 28,953 thousand in 2022 to SGD 24,957 thousand in 2023, reflecting effective liability management and reduced financial obligations. Shareholders' equity increased marginally to SGD 82,150 thousand from SGD 81,342 thousand, supported by higher retained earnings (SGD 17,476 thousand in 2023 vs. SGD 15,054 thousand in 2022), which strengthens the equity base. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio rising from 171.58% in 2022 to 186.75% in 2023, indicating enhanced short-term financial stability. The debt to equity ratio declined from 35.59% to 30.38%, signaling a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects solid financial health with prudent asset and liability management and a robust equity position. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 6.0% from SGD 69,994K in 2023 to SGD 74,197K in 2024, driven mainly by growth in specialised health services revenue (from SGD 66,015K to SGD 70,601K), despite a decline in general health services revenue (from SGD 3,979K to SGD 3,596K). Gross profit improved from SGD 31,036K to SGD 32,668K, maintaining a stable gross margin around 156%. Operating expenses rose by 14.1% to SGD 15,908K, which contributed to a slight decrease in net profit from SGD 13,150K to SGD 12,894K, resulting in a net profit margin decline from 18.79% to 17.38%. Income before taxes decreased marginally from SGD 17,314K to SGD 17,187K, while the effective tax rate increased from 24.05% to 24.98%, slightly compressing net earnings. Return on equity and return on assets both declined, from 16.09% to 14.83% and 12.10% to 11.40% respectively, indicating a modest reduction in earnings quality and profitability sustainability. Overall, the company showed revenue growth but faced margin pressure due to higher operating expenses and tax rates, leading to slightly lower profitability ratios. | Revenue increased by 11.1% from SGD 62,954 thousand in 2022 to SGD 69,994 thousand in 2023, driven primarily by specialized health services (SGD 66,015 thousand) and general health services (SGD 3,979 thousand). Gross profit rose to SGD 31,036 thousand in 2023 from SGD 28,800 thousand in 2022, with a gross margin of 155.66% in 2023 (2022 margin not available), indicating strong profitability at the gross level. Net profit increased slightly to SGD 13,150 thousand from SGD 12,700 thousand, though net profit margin declined from 20.17% to 18.79%, suggesting some margin pressure possibly due to higher costs or expenses. Income before taxes increased modestly to SGD 17,314 thousand from SGD 16,778 thousand, with a stable effective tax rate around 24%. Return on equity was 16.09% and return on assets 12.10% in 2023, indicating efficient use of equity and assets to generate earnings. Overall, profitability improved in absolute terms with solid earnings quality, though margin compression warrants monitoring. |
| Operational efficiency | The company improved asset utilization as reflected by an increase in asset turnover from 64.39% in 2023 to 65.62% in 2024, indicating more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Despite this, operating margin data is unavailable, but the rise in operating expenses by 14.1% outpaced gross profit growth, suggesting some challenges in cost control. Net cash from operations increased slightly from SGD 17,171K to SGD 17,642K, supporting operational cash flow strength. Inventories increased modestly from SGD 2,235K to SGD 2,501K, which may indicate higher stock levels or preparation for demand. Working capital decreased as current assets fell and current liabilities rose, consistent with the lower current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: improved asset turnover and stable operating cash flow, but increased operating expenses and reduced liquidity may warrant attention. | Operating expenses in 2023 were SGD 13,942 thousand, with no comparable 2022 data, limiting trend analysis. The asset turnover ratio was 64.39% in 2023, indicating moderate efficiency in generating revenue from assets. Net cash from operations slightly decreased to SGD 17,171 thousand from SGD 17,848 thousand in 2022, reflecting stable but slightly reduced cash generation capacity. Inventories increased from SGD 1,874 thousand to SGD 2,235 thousand, which may impact working capital management. The current ratio improvement to 186.75% suggests good liquidity to cover short-term obligations. Overall, operational efficiency appears stable with effective cost control and asset utilization, though slight declines in cash flow from operations and increased inventories should be monitored. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remained stable with a slight improvement in the debt to equity ratio from 30.38% to 29.77%, indicating controlled use of debt relative to equity. Interest expense decreased from SGD 651K to SGD 602K, which may reduce financial burden, though interest coverage ratios are unavailable. The current ratio declined significantly from 186.75% to 148.25%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity and potential risk in meeting current obligations. The effective tax rate increased slightly, which could impact net profitability. The net cash from financing activities improved (less negative) from SGD (11,305)K to SGD (9,129)K, reflecting lower cash outflows possibly due to reduced dividend payments (SGD 6,615K in 2024 vs SGD 10,541K in 2023). Overall, financial risk appears moderate with manageable leverage but some liquidity pressure and increased tax burden that should be monitored. | Leverage decreased in 2023 as total liabilities fell and the debt to equity ratio improved to 30.38% from 35.59% in 2022, reducing financial risk. Interest expense increased from SGD 555 thousand to SGD 651 thousand, but without interest coverage ratio data, the impact on earnings coverage is unclear. The effective tax rate remained stable at approximately 24%, indicating no significant tax risk changes. Liquidity improved with a higher current ratio of 186.75%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. However, net cash from financing activities showed a larger outflow of SGD 11,305 thousand in 2023 compared to SGD 7,167 thousand in 2022, driven by significantly higher dividends paid (SGD 10,541 thousand vs. SGD 4,398 thousand), which could pressure cash reserves. Overall, financial risk is moderate with improved leverage and liquidity but requires attention to cash outflows from financing. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities intensified in 2024 as net cash from investing activities nearly doubled its outflow from SGD (6,432)K to SGD (12,780)K, indicating increased capital expenditure or acquisitions that may support future growth. Dividend payments decreased substantially, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy or retention of earnings to fund investments. Revenue growth was driven by the specialised health services segment and the Malaysian geographic market, which increased from SGD 55,960K to SGD 59,597K, and Myanmar also showed growth from SGD 1,987K to SGD 2,748K, while Singapore revenue slightly declined. These trends suggest growth opportunities in specific markets and service lines. Net cash from operations remains strong and slightly improved, supporting cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company appears positioned for growth through increased investment and focus on expanding markets, with a cautious approach to dividend distribution to maintain financial flexibility. | Investment activities in 2023 show a reduced net cash outflow from investing at SGD 6,432 thousand compared to SGD 11,600 thousand in 2022, suggesting a moderation in capital expenditures or asset purchases. The substantial increase in dividends paid to SGD 10,541 thousand from SGD 4,398 thousand indicates a strong dividend policy, which may impact cash flow sustainability if not matched by operational cash generation. Revenue concentration is notable in Malaysia (SGD 55,960 thousand) and Singapore (SGD 12,047 thousand), with smaller contributions from Myanmar (SGD 1,987 thousand), highlighting geographic revenue dependence that could influence future growth prospects. Given stable operational cash flow and moderated investing outflows, the company appears positioned for steady financial performance, though dividend payout levels and geographic concentration should be monitored for future sustainability and growth. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces economic challenges including inflationary pressures that have led to increased operating costs, particularly noted in Myanmar where fee adjustments were made to reflect higher costs due to inflation. Rising operating costs have adversely affected profitability in Singapore, contributing to impairment losses for goodwill in subsidiaries JLMBB and JLMYT. The Group also experiences cost pressures from increased staff-related costs, depreciation expenses due to expanded operations and new centres, and higher administrative expenses. Additionally, there is exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings denominated in Malaysian Ringgit with floating rates, which could impact finance costs. The political situation in Myanmar remains uncertain, posing potential risks to operations there. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate credit facilities and cash levels to meet obligations. Forward-looking revenue growth assumptions are sensitive to market and economic conditions, with a noted risk that a decrease in revenue growth rates could lead to further impairment losses. Overall, inflation, cost increases, economic uncertainties in key markets, and sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations represent significant economic challenges that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces economic challenges including exposure to interest rate risks primarily from borrowings at floating rates denominated in Malaysian Ringgit, which could affect future cash flows and financial instrument values. Inflationary pressures have contributed to increased operating costs, leading to a decline in gross profit margin from 45.7% in FY2022 to 44.3% in FY2023 despite revenue growth. The Group is also exposed to credit risks from trade receivables, with provisions for expected credit losses incorporating forward-looking macroeconomic factors such as GDP forecasts. Liquidity risks are managed prudently to ensure the Group can meet short-term obligations, but economic uncertainties remain due to market volatility and political instability, notably the extended state of emergency in Myanmar which delays elections and could impact operations. Additionally, the Group is navigating cost pressures from higher staff-related expenses and depreciation due to expanded operations and acquisitions. These economic factors collectively pose uncertainties that could impact revenue growth and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Group faces competitive pressures manifested in rising competition in Singapore, which has contributed to decreased revenue and profitability in its general health services segment, particularly impacting subsidiaries JLMBB and JLMYT. The closure of evening clinic sessions at JLMYT led to fewer patient visits, indicating challenges in maintaining market share and customer engagement. The Group acknowledges competition from established players such as Aier Eye Hospital Group Co., Ltd., which operates in similar business areas, although currently without presence in Southeast Asia outside the Group's operations. The Group actively invests in upgrading skills and technology to remain future-ready and enhance its market position. It also participates in local forums and community events to elevate its profile and educate the public, indicating efforts to counter competitive threats. The Group continues to explore regional expansion opportunities, including new markets like Vietnam, to strengthen its competitive position. Technological disruption and industry dynamics are implied through ongoing investments in state-of-the-art ophthalmic equipment and digitalisation trends affecting vision problems, which the Group aims to leverage. Overall, the Group faces competitive threats from both established industry players and market dynamics that require continuous innovation, market expansion, and customer engagement to maintain and grow its market position. | The Group operates in a competitive healthcare market with pressures from established players and potential new entrants. Notably, there is a conflict of interest situation involving key management personnel who are also associated with Aier Eye Hospital Group Co., Ltd., a major competitor with similar business operations, although currently Aier has no business in Southeast Asia outside the Group's operations. The Group is actively expanding its footprint in existing and new markets, which may intensify competition. The need to attract and retain talent in a highly competitive labor market is a challenge, prompting ongoing reviews of staff remuneration and benefits to maintain the Group's reputation as an employer of choice. Technological advancements and the requirement to invest in state-of-the-art ophthalmic equipment also present competitive dynamics. The Group must continuously innovate and enhance service quality to sustain its market position amid evolving industry dynamics and potential disruptive entrants. |
