# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased steadily from SGD 62,954K in 2022 to SGD 69,994K in 2023 (an 11.15% increase), and further to SGD 74,197K in 2024 (a 5.98% increase from 2023). Gross profit also rose from SGD 28,800K in 2022 to SGD 31,036K in 2023 (7.81% increase) and SGD 32,668K in 2024 (5.23% increase). However, the reported gross margin percentages appear unusually high at 79.91% in 2022 and over 155% in 2023 and 2024, indicating possible data inconsistencies or unusual cost accounting. Revenue by product/service shows that specialised health services dominate, growing from SGD 58,514K in 2022 to SGD 66,015K in 2023 (12.85% increase) and SGD 70,601K in 2024 (6.94% increase). General health services revenue declined steadily from SGD 4,440K in 2022 to SGD 3,979K in 2023 (10.44% decrease) and SGD 3,596K in 2024 (9.63% decrease). Geographically, Malaysia is the largest revenue contributor, increasing from SGD 49,696K in 2022 to SGD 55,960K in 2023 (12.66% increase) and SGD 59,597K in 2024 (6.53% increase). Singapore revenue remained relatively flat, with a slight increase from SGD 11,342K in 2022 to SGD 12,047K in 2023 (6.23% increase) but a small decline to SGD 11,852K in 2024 (1.63% decrease). Myanmar revenue grew steadily from SGD 1,916K in 2022 to SGD 1,987K in 2023 (3.72% increase) and SGD 2,748K in 2024 (38.34% increase), indicating emerging market growth. Overall, revenue growth is driven primarily by specialised health services and Malaysia, while general health services and Singapore show slight declines or stagnation. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 24.48% in 2023 to 22.62% in 2024, indicating a slight deterioration in operating efficiency. Operating income decreased marginally from SGD 17,134K in 2023 to SGD 16,780K in 2024 (2.06% decrease) despite revenue growth, suggesting rising operating expenses or cost pressures. Operating expenses increased from SGD 13,842K in 2023 to SGD 15,888K in 2024 (14.75% increase), outpacing revenue growth of 5.98%, which negatively impacted operating margin. The operating income to revenue ratio confirms this trend, with operating income representing 24.48% of revenue in 2023 but dropping to 22.62% in 2024. This indicates cost management challenges, as expenses grew faster than revenue, reducing profitability at the operating level. The absence of operating income and expense data for 2022 limits trend analysis for that year. Overall, while revenue and gross profit grew, operating efficiency weakened due to disproportionate expense increases. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable but showed a slight increase from 24.05% in 2023 to 24.98% in 2024, which marginally reduced net profit. Notably, the 2022 effective tax rate was 24.14%, consistent with subsequent years. Income tax expense increased from SGD 4,164K in 2023 to SGD 4,293K in 2024 (3.07% increase), despite only a 5.98% revenue increase, reflecting the slightly higher tax rate. There is an inconsistency in the 2022 income tax expense reported as a positive SGD 4,050K, which may indicate a tax benefit or data error. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are indicated in the data. External factors such as geographic revenue shifts, especially the strong growth in Myanmar, may influence future profitability but are not directly linked to one-off impacts in the data. Overall, tax expenses and rates have had a stable but slightly increasing impact on net profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from SGD 107,107 thousand in 2023 to SGD 119,046 thousand, reflecting asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from SGD 80,086 thousand to SGD 94,191 thousand. Total liabilities increased moderately from SGD 24,957 thousand to SGD 27,307 thousand, with current liabilities rising more significantly than non-current liabilities. Shareholders' equity strengthened from SGD 82,150 thousand to SGD 91,739 thousand, supported by a notable increase in retained earnings from SGD 17,476 thousand to SGD 23,685 thousand. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 186.75% to 148.25%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity but still maintaining a comfortable buffer above 1. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved from 30.38% to 29.77%, suggesting stable and manageable leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth with prudent liability management and a strong equity base, though liquidity has somewhat contracted. | In 2023, the company shows a slightly decreased total asset base at SGD 107,107 thousand compared to SGD 110,295 thousand in 2022, indicating a modest contraction in asset size. Both current and non-current assets declined, with current assets decreasing from SGD 27,617 thousand to SGD 27,021 thousand and non-current assets from SGD 82,678 thousand to SGD 80,086 thousand. Total liabilities reduced significantly from SGD 28,953 thousand in 2022 to SGD 24,957 thousand in 2023, driven by decreases in both current liabilities (from SGD 16,096 thousand to SGD 14,469 thousand) and non-current liabilities (from SGD 12,857 thousand to SGD 10,488 thousand). This liability reduction improved the debt to equity ratio from 35.59% to 30.38%, reflecting stronger balance sheet leverage management. Shareholders' equity increased slightly to SGD 82,150 thousand from SGD 81,342 thousand, supported by higher retained earnings rising from SGD 15,054 thousand to SGD 17,476 thousand. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio increasing from 171.58% to 186.75%, indicating enhanced short-term financial stability. Overall, the company maintained a solid financial position in 2023 with prudent liability management, stable equity growth, and improved liquidity despite a slight contraction in total assets. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by approximately 6% from SGD 69,994 thousand in 2023 to SGD 74,197 thousand in 2024, driven mainly by growth in specialised health services revenue (from SGD 66,015 thousand to SGD 70,601 thousand), despite a slight decline in general health services revenue. Gross profit improved from SGD 31,036 thousand to SGD 32,668 thousand, maintaining a stable gross margin around 156%. However, operating income decreased slightly from SGD 17,134 thousand to SGD 16,780 thousand, causing the operating margin to decline from 24.48% to 22.62%. Net profit also decreased marginally from SGD 13,150 thousand to SGD 12,894 thousand, with the net profit margin falling from 18.79% to 17.38%. Return on equity and return on assets both declined, from 16.09% to 14.83% and 12.10% to 11.40% respectively, indicating slightly reduced earnings efficiency and sustainability. The effective tax rate increased modestly from 24.05% to 24.98%. Overall, profitability remains strong but shows slight compression in margins and returns compared to the prior year. | Revenue increased by approximately 11.1% from SGD 62,954 thousand in 2022 to SGD 69,994 thousand in 2023, driven primarily by growth in specialised health services revenue (from SGD 58,514 thousand to SGD 66,015 thousand), while general health services revenue slightly declined. Gross profit improved from SGD 28,800 thousand to SGD 31,036 thousand, with gross margin reported at an unusually high 155.66% in 2023 compared to 79.91% in 2022, likely due to the negative cost of goods sold figure in 2023 (SGD -38,958 thousand), which may indicate accounting or classification anomalies. Operating income for 2023 was SGD 17,134 thousand with an operating margin of 24.48%. Net profit increased modestly from SGD 12,700 thousand to SGD 13,150 thousand, though net profit margin slightly decreased from 20.17% to 18.79%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 16.09% and 12.10%, respectively, indicating reasonable profitability and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate was negative at -24.05% in 2023 compared to 24.14% in 2022, suggesting tax benefits or credits impacting earnings quality. Overall, profitability improved in absolute terms with strong revenue growth and stable net income, but margin and tax anomalies warrant further investigation for earnings sustainability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses rose from SGD 13,842 thousand in 2023 to SGD 15,888 thousand in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and contributing to the decline in operating margin. Asset turnover improved slightly from 64.39% to 65.62%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased modestly from SGD 17,171 thousand to SGD 17,642 thousand, reflecting stable cash generation capacity. Inventories increased from SGD 2,235 thousand to SGD 2,501 thousand, which may suggest higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. The current ratio decreased, indicating some tightening in working capital management. Overall, while asset utilization and cash flow from operations improved, cost control pressures are evident with rising operating expenses impacting margins. | Operating expenses in 2023 were SGD 13,842 thousand, supporting an operating income of SGD 17,134 thousand and an operating margin of 24.48%, indicating effective cost control relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover was exceptionally high at 64.39, suggesting very efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue, although this figure is unusually large and may reflect data or classification issues. Net cash from operations slightly decreased from SGD 17,848 thousand in 2022 to SGD 17,171 thousand in 2023, indicating stable but slightly reduced cash generation from core operations. Inventories increased from SGD 1,874 thousand to SGD 2,235 thousand, which may reflect higher stock levels to support increased sales. Working capital remained strong with current assets exceeding current liabilities and an improved current ratio of 186.75%. Overall, operational efficiency appears robust with good cost management, strong asset utilization, and stable operational cash flows. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remained stable with the debt to equity ratio slightly improving from 30.38% to 29.77%, indicating no significant increase in financial risk from debt. Interest expense decreased from SGD 651 thousand to SGD 602 thousand, while interest coverage ratio improved substantially from 2631.95% to 2787.38%, reflecting strong ability to service interest obligations. The current ratio declined from 186.75% to 148.25%, signaling reduced liquidity but still a comfortable short-term financial position. The effective tax rate increased slightly, which could marginally impact net profitability. No alarming risk indicators are present, but the decline in liquidity and rising operating expenses warrant monitoring. | The company’s leverage decreased in 2023 as total liabilities fell and the debt to equity ratio improved to 30.38% from 35.59% in 2022, reducing financial risk. Liquidity improved with the current ratio rising to 186.75%, indicating strong short-term solvency. Interest expense increased slightly from SGD 555 thousand to SGD 651 thousand, but interest coverage ratio is reported as a large negative figure (-2631.95%), which is unusual and may indicate negative operating income or data irregularities; however, given positive operating income, this may be a calculation or reporting anomaly. The effective tax rate turned negative (-24.05%) from a positive 24.14% in 2022, which could signal tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces uncertainty in tax obligations. No significant increases in liabilities or cash flow stress are evident, but the unusual tax and interest coverage figures suggest areas for close monitoring. Overall, financial risk appears moderate with improved leverage and liquidity but some anomalies in tax and interest metrics that require further review. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities intensified in 2024, with net cash used in investing activities nearly doubling from SGD (6,432) thousand to SGD (12,780) thousand, indicating significant capital expenditure or acquisitions aimed at growth. Despite higher investing outflows, net cash from operations increased, supporting cash flow sustainability. Dividends paid decreased substantially from SGD (10,541) thousand to SGD (6,615) thousand, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash for investments. Revenue growth was driven by the specialised health services segment and the Malaysian geographic market, which grew from SGD 55,960 thousand to SGD 59,597 thousand, while Singapore revenue slightly declined. Myanmar revenue showed notable growth from SGD 1,987 thousand to SGD 2,748 thousand, indicating emerging market expansion. These trends suggest a strategic focus on growth markets and reinvestment for future performance improvement. | Investment activities showed a reduction in net cash outflow from investing activities, decreasing from SGD (11,600) thousand in 2022 to SGD (6,432) thousand in 2023, indicating a lower level of capital expenditure or asset purchases which may impact future growth. Financing cash outflows increased significantly from SGD (7,167) thousand to SGD (11,305) thousand, driven largely by a substantial increase in dividends paid (from SGD 4,398 thousand to SGD 10,541 thousand), suggesting a strong dividend policy that may affect cash reserves. Revenue growth was supported by increases in key geographic markets, notably Malaysia (from SGD 49,696 thousand to SGD 55,960 thousand) and Singapore (from SGD 11,342 thousand to SGD 12,047 thousand), indicating positive market trends in these regions. Myanmar revenue remained relatively stable. The company’s stable operational cash flow and strong equity base support sustainable future performance, but the reduced investing outflows and increased dividend payments may constrain growth investments. Overall, the company appears positioned for steady future performance with growth in core markets, balanced by cautious investment and a shareholder-friendly dividend approach. |
