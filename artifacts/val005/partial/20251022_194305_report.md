# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | ISEC Healthcare Ltd.'s revenue showed a consistent upward trend from SGD 62,954,000 in 2022 to SGD 69,994,000 in 2023, and further to SGD 74,197,000 in 2024. Gross profit also increased from SGD 28,767,000 in 2022 to SGD 31,036,000 in 2023 and SGD 32,668,000 in 2024, with gross margin slightly improving from 154.30% in 2022 to 155.66% in 2023 and 155.97% in 2024, indicating stable cost control relative to revenue growth. Revenue by product/service reveals that specialised health services dominate, growing from SGD 58,514,000 in 2022 to SGD 70,601,000 in 2024, while general health services declined from SGD 4,440,000 in 2022 to SGD 3,596,000 in 2024. Geographically, Malaysia is the largest revenue contributor, increasing from SGD 49,696,000 in 2022 to SGD 59,597,000 in 2024, followed by Singapore with relatively stable revenue around SGD 11-12 million, and Myanmar showing moderate growth from SGD 1,916,000 in 2022 to SGD 2,748,000 in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin experienced a significant decline from 27.45% in 2022 to 24.71% in 2023 and plummeted to 0.02% in 2024, despite operating income remaining relatively stable at approximately SGD 17,284,000 in 2022 and SGD 17,294,000 in 2023, but dropping sharply to SGD 16,080,000 in 2024. Operating expenses increased notably from SGD 11,783,000 in 2022 to SGD 14,342,000 in 2023 and further to SGD 16,588,000 in 2024, indicating rising cost pressures that outpaced revenue growth and eroded operating profitability. This suggests challenges in cost management, as the increase in operating expenses has significantly impacted operating income relative to revenue. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable over the period, with a slight increase from 24.14% in 2022 to 24.98% in 2024, which modestly impacted net profit margins that declined from 20.22% in 2022 to 17.38% in 2024. Income tax expense rose from SGD 4,050,000 in 2022 to SGD 4,293,000 in 2024, consistent with higher pre-tax profits. There are no explicitly listed non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, ISEC Healthcare Ltd. demonstrated an overall strengthening in financial health with total assets increasing from SGD 107,107K in 2023 to SGD 119,046K, driven primarily by a rise in non-current assets from SGD 80,086K to SGD 94,191K. Total liabilities also increased moderately from SGD 24,957K to SGD 27,307K, with current liabilities rising from SGD 14,469K to SGD 16,766K and non-current liabilities remaining relatively stable. Shareholders' equity grew significantly from SGD 82,150K to SGD 90,059K, supported by a notable increase in retained earnings from SGD 17,476K to SGD 23,685K. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 186.75% to 148.25%, indicating a reduction in short-term asset coverage of current liabilities but still maintaining a comfortable liquidity position above 1. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 30.3%, reflecting a consistent capital structure with moderate leverage. Overall, the company’s balance sheet shows growth in asset base and equity, with manageable increases in liabilities and a solid capital structure in 2024. | In 2023, ISEC Healthcare Ltd. showed a slight decrease in total assets to SGD 107,107 thousand from SGD 110,295 thousand in 2022, driven by reductions in both current assets (SGD 27,021 thousand vs. SGD 27,617 thousand) and non-current assets (SGD 80,086 thousand vs. SGD 82,678 thousand). Total liabilities decreased notably to SGD 24,957 thousand from SGD 28,953 thousand, with both current liabilities (SGD 14,469 thousand vs. SGD 16,096 thousand) and non-current liabilities (SGD 10,488 thousand vs. SGD 12,857 thousand) declining. Shareholders' equity increased modestly to SGD 82,150 thousand from SGD 81,342 thousand, supported by higher retained earnings (SGD 17,476 thousand vs. SGD 15,054 thousand). The current ratio improved to 186.75% from 171.58%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 30.38% from 35.59%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained solid financial health with strong equity base, improved liquidity, and lower leverage in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 6.0% from SGD 69,994K in 2023 to SGD 74,197K in 2024, driven mainly by growth in specialised health services revenue (up from SGD 66,015K to SGD 70,601K) and geographic expansion in Malaysia and Myanmar. Gross profit improved from SGD 31,036K to SGD 32,668K, maintaining a stable gross margin around 156%. However, operating income declined from SGD 17,294K to SGD 16,080K, reflecting increased operating expenses rising from SGD 14,342K to SGD 16,588K, which compressed the operating margin drastically from 24.71% to 0.02%. Net profit slightly decreased from SGD 13,150K to SGD 12,894K, with net profit margin falling from 18.79% to 17.38%. Return on equity and return on assets also declined moderately, from 16.09% to 14.97% and 12.10% to 11.40% respectively, indicating a slight deterioration in earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns. The effective tax rate increased marginally from 24.05% to 24.98%. Overall, while top-line growth was positive, profitability was pressured by rising operating costs, leading to margin compression and slightly lower returns in 2024. | ISEC Healthcare Ltd. experienced revenue growth in 2023, increasing to SGD 69,994 thousand from SGD 62,954 thousand in 2022, driven primarily by higher specialized health services revenue (SGD 66,015 thousand vs. SGD 58,514 thousand). Gross profit rose to SGD 31,036 thousand from SGD 28,767 thousand, with gross margin slightly improving to 155.66% from 154.30%. However, operating expenses increased significantly to SGD 14,342 thousand from SGD 11,783 thousand, resulting in a nearly flat operating income of SGD 17,294 thousand compared to SGD 17,284 thousand in 2022. Operating margin declined to 24.71% from 27.45%. Net profit increased modestly to SGD 13,150 thousand from SGD 12,728 thousand, but net profit margin decreased to 18.79% from 20.22%. Return on equity and return on assets were 16.09% and 12.10% respectively in 2023, indicating reasonable earnings quality and effective use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate remained stable at approximately 24%. Overall, profitability improved in absolute terms but margins compressed slightly due to higher operating expenses. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased in line with revenue, from SGD 38,958K to SGD 41,529K, maintaining gross margin stability. However, operating expenses rose disproportionately by 15.6%, from SGD 14,342K to SGD 16,588K, indicating less effective cost control. Asset turnover improved slightly from 64.39% to 65.62%, suggesting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories increased modestly from SGD 2,235K to SGD 2,501K, which may reflect inventory buildup or slower turnover. Net cash from operations increased slightly from SGD 17,171K to SGD 17,642K, supporting operational cash flow sustainability. Working capital dynamics show a decrease in current assets from SGD 27,021K to SGD 24,855K against an increase in current liabilities from SGD 14,469K to SGD 16,766K, contributing to the lower current ratio. Cash flow from investing activities nearly doubled from SGD 6,432K to SGD 12,780K, indicating increased investment spending. Net cash from financing decreased from SGD 11,305K to SGD 9,129K, and dividends paid dropped significantly from SGD 10,541K to SGD 6,615K, reflecting a more conservative cash distribution policy. Overall, operational efficiency was challenged by rising expenses but supported by stable cash flow generation and improved asset turnover. | Operationally, the company managed revenue growth alongside increased cost of goods sold (SGD 38,958 thousand vs. SGD 34,187 thousand), which kept gross profit growth moderate. Inventories increased to SGD 2,235 thousand from SGD 1,874 thousand, suggesting higher stock levels possibly to support increased sales. Asset turnover was strong at 64.39%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations slightly decreased to SGD 17,171 thousand from SGD 17,848 thousand, reflecting stable but slightly reduced cash generation from core business activities. Working capital improved as current assets and current liabilities both decreased, but the current ratio increased, indicating better short-term liquidity management. Net cash from investing activities decreased to SGD 6,432 thousand from SGD 11,600 thousand, showing reduced investment outflows. Overall, the company maintained operational efficiency with strong asset utilization and stable cash flow from operations despite increased costs. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 reveal some early warning signs despite stable leverage. The debt to equity ratio remained steady at about 30.3%, indicating no significant increase in financial leverage. However, liquidity risk increased as the current ratio declined from 186.75% to 148.25%, reflecting tighter short-term liquidity. Interest expense decreased slightly from SGD 651K to SGD 602K, but the interest coverage ratio dropped dramatically from an extremely high 2656.53% in 2023 to 2.67% in 2024, signaling a sharp reduction in the company's ability to cover interest expenses from operating income. This is primarily due to the significant drop in operating income. The effective tax rate increased slightly, which could marginally impact net profitability. The combination of compressed operating margins, reduced interest coverage, and lower liquidity suggests emerging financial risks that require monitoring, particularly if operating income pressures persist. | Financial risk indicators suggest a moderate risk profile for 2023. The debt to equity ratio declined to 30.38% from 35.59%, reducing financial leverage and associated risk. Interest expense increased to SGD 651 thousand from SGD 555 thousand, but interest coverage remained very high at 2656.53%, down from 3114.23%, indicating ample earnings to cover interest obligations and low default risk. The effective tax rate was stable at around 24%, showing no significant tax burden changes. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the higher current ratio of 186.75%. No significant increases in liabilities or cash flow stress were observed. However, the increase in operating expenses and interest expense warrants monitoring. Overall, the company exhibits low financial risk with strong coverage ratios and improved liquidity in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, ISEC Healthcare Ltd.'s increased investment activity in 2024, as evidenced by the doubling of net cash used in investing activities from SGD 6,432K to SGD 12,780K, suggests a focus on growth and asset expansion, likely in non-current assets. The sustainability of cash flows appears solid with net cash from operations increasing slightly to SGD 17,642K, supporting ongoing investment and dividend payments. However, dividends were reduced significantly from SGD 10,541K to SGD 6,615K, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash for investments or to strengthen the balance sheet. Revenue growth in specialised health services and geographic expansion in Malaysia and Myanmar provide positive cues for future top-line growth. Nonetheless, the pressure on operating margins and interest coverage highlights the need for improved cost management to sustain profitability. Overall, the company is positioned for growth with increased investments and stable operational cash flow, but must address margin pressures and financial risk indicators to ensure long-term financial performance. | Looking ahead, ISEC Healthcare Ltd.'s future financial performance appears cautiously optimistic. The company increased dividends substantially to SGD 10,541 thousand from SGD 4,398 thousand, indicating confidence in cash flow sustainability and a shareholder-friendly policy. Net cash from financing increased to SGD 11,305 thousand from SGD 7,167 thousand, suggesting active capital management possibly to support dividend payments or other financing needs. Net cash from investing decreased, implying reduced investment outflows which may limit growth but preserve cash. Revenue growth was driven mainly by specialized health services and the Malaysian geographic segment, which grew to SGD 55,960 thousand from SGD 49,696 thousand, signaling key growth areas. The stable and strong cash flow from operations supports ongoing operations and dividend payments. Overall, the company is positioned for steady performance with focus on maintaining cash flow and rewarding shareholders, while growth may be concentrated in specialized services and key markets like Malaysia. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | ISEC Healthcare Ltd. faces market risks including competition and rising costs in Singapore impacting general health services subsidiaries JLMBB and JLMYT, which recorded revenue decreases of 7% and 15% respectively. The Group is exposed to demand volatility influenced by government health initiatives such as Healthier SG and Age Well SG programs supporting GP services demand. The Group is also exposed to external market factors such as regional economic conditions and industry trends, including increasing affluence in the region, digitalization leading to more vision problems, and an aging population increasing eye conditions. The Group is actively pursuing regional expansion, including potential entry into Vietnam, to mitigate market concentration risks. The Group's revenue is diversified with no single customer accounting for more than 9% of total revenue, reducing customer concentration risk.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces economic challenges including rising operating costs and inflationary pressures, notably in Myanmar where fee adjustments were made to reflect higher operating costs due to inflation. Increased administrative expenses were driven by higher staff-related costs and depreciation from expanded operations. The Singapore general health services segment experienced adverse effects from rising costs, leading to decreased revenue and impairment losses. Interest rate risk exists due to borrowings at floating rates denominated in Malaysian Ringgit, with sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations impacting profit. Foreign currency risk arises from intergroup balances denominated in Malaysian Ringgit, with currency translation losses affecting lease liabilities. Liquidity risk is managed prudently, but the Group must ensure sufficient cash and credit facilities to meet obligations. The political situation in Myanmar remains uncertain, posing potential risks to operations there. Overall, inflation, cost pressures, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical uncertainties present forward-looking economic challenges that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces economic challenges including exposure to interest rate risks primarily from borrowings denominated in Malaysian Ringgit with floating rates, which could impact profit due to fluctuations in interest expenses. The political situation in Myanmar, with the military extending the state of emergency until July 2024 and delaying elections, creates uncertainty affecting operations in that market. The Group operates in emerging Southeast Asian markets where the medical eye care industry is nascent, implying economic uncertainties and the need for professionalism and talent. Cost pressures are evident from increased staff-related costs and depreciation expenses due to expanded operations and fixed assets. The Group also manages liquidity risks by ensuring availability of credit facilities and sufficient cash levels to meet obligations. Forward-looking revenue growth assumptions consider historical trends, market and economic conditions, and industry indices, but uncertainties remain in these estimates. Inflationary pressures and shifting consumer behavior are implied by increased operating costs and the need to attract and retain talent in a highly competitive labor market. The Group is also exposed to foreign currency risks from intergroup balances denominated in Malaysian Ringgit, which may affect financial performance. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Group faces competitive pressures particularly in Singapore's general health services segment, where rising costs and increased competition have adversely affected performance, resulting in revenue declines and goodwill impairment losses for subsidiaries JLMBB and JLMYT. The cessation of evening clinic hours at JLMYT also contributed to fewer patient visits. While the report does not explicitly mention new disruptive entrants or technological disruption as competitive threats, the adverse impact of competition and cost pressures in Singapore indicates challenging industry dynamics. The Group's strategy to continuously upgrade skills and enhance equipment with the latest technology, as well as active participation in local forums and community events, reflects efforts to maintain and elevate its market position amid competitive challenges. | The Group operates in a highly competitive labor market, necessitating constant review of staff remuneration and benefits to attract and retain talent, indicating competitive pressures in human resources. The Group faces competition from established industry players and potential new entrants in emerging Southeast Asian markets such as Cambodia and Vietnam, where the medical eye care industry is still developing. The Vice-Chairman and CEO of the Group is also Vice-Chairman and CEO of Aier Eye Hospital Group Co., Ltd., a major player in the same industry, though currently Aier Group has no business in Southeast Asia other than that carried out by the Group, suggesting potential competitive dynamics within related entities. The Group is expanding its footprint and services, including acquiring new premises and increasing capacity, to strengthen its market position amid competitive industry dynamics. Technological disruption is indirectly addressed through the Group's investment in state-of-the-art ophthalmic equipment and continuous professional development of doctors to maintain high standards of care.
