# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue increased slightly by 3.34% from 45,808 to 47,366 USD thousands, but then declined by 4.04% to 45,492 USD thousands in 2024. Gross profit improved from 26,857 USD thousands in 2023 to 28,550 USD thousands in 2024, despite the revenue decline, indicating better cost control or product mix. Gross margin decreased from 143.30% in 2023 to 137.24% in 2024, showing a slight erosion in profitability relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service shows a decline in both segments: Ship owning revenue dropped by 2.56% from 32,428 to 31,596 USD thousands, and Agency and logistics revenue fell by 7.01% from 14,938 to 13,896 USD thousands between 2023 and 2024. Geographically, revenue in Japan decreased by 1.67% to 21,485 USD thousands, Singapore revenue declined by 7.56% to 13,682 USD thousands, and revenue from Others decreased by 3.72% to 10,325 USD thousands, indicating a broad-based revenue contraction across regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, reflecting reduced operational efficiency. Operating income dropped by 23.22% from 10,478 to 8,046 USD thousands, while revenue decreased by only 4.04%, indicating disproportionate operating income decline relative to revenue. Operating expenses increased by 6.36% from 21,879 to 23,278 USD thousands despite lower revenue, suggesting deteriorating cost management effectiveness. The rising operating expenses amid declining revenue and operating income highlight challenges in controlling overhead or fixed costs, negatively impacting profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained negligible and slightly negative at -0.02% in 2024 compared to -0.01% in 2023, indicating minimal tax expense impact on profitability. Income tax expense was nearly zero (-2 USD thousands in 2024 and -1 USD thousands in 2023), suggesting possible tax credits or adjustments. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability are not detailed, but the broad-based revenue and margin declines across products and regions may imply market or economic pressures impacting the business environment. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a solid financial position with an increase in shareholders' equity from 123,323 to 130,832 (thousands USD), indicating strengthened equity base. Current assets increased from 75,817 to 84,294, while non-current assets slightly decreased from 113,287 to 108,609, reflecting a modest reallocation or depreciation of long-term assets. Total liabilities decreased from 54,037 to 50,595, driven by reductions in both current liabilities (11,744 to 11,476) and non-current liabilities (54,037 to 50,595), improving the capital structure. The current ratio improved significantly from 645.58% to 734.52%, indicating enhanced liquidity and ability to cover short-term obligations. Debt to equity ratio declined from 43.82% to 38.67%, suggesting reduced leverage and a more conservative financial structure. Overall, the balance sheet strength improved with better liquidity, lower leverage, and increased equity, despite the absence of total assets data. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with a strong balance sheet. Current assets increased from $67,976K in 2022 to $75,817K in 2023, indicating improved liquidity. Non-current assets slightly decreased from $119,302K to $113,287K, suggesting some asset disposals or depreciation. Total liabilities decreased from $56,897K to $54,037K, reflecting effective liability management and a reduction in financial obligations. Current liabilities also declined from $12,570K to $11,744K, enhancing short-term financial stability. Shareholders' equity grew from $117,811K to $123,323K, supported by an increase in retained earnings from $84,758K to $90,913K, indicating reinvestment of profits and strengthening of the equity base. The current ratio improved significantly from 540.78% to 645.58%, highlighting excellent liquidity and ability to cover short-term liabilities. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 48.30% to 43.82%, showing a conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 is robust with strong liquidity, controlled liabilities, and a growing equity position. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue decreased slightly from 47,366 to 45,492 (thousands USD), a decline of about 4%, with both main segments (ship owning and agency/logistics) showing lower revenues. Despite lower revenue, gross profit increased from 26,857 to 28,550, reflecting improved cost of goods sold management (COGS decreased from -20,509 to -16,942). However, operating income declined from 10,478 to 8,046 due to higher operating expenses (increased from -21,879 to -23,278). Net profit decreased from 11,514 to 9,136, with net profit margin falling from 24.31% to 20.08%. Return on equity also declined from 9.55% to 7.19%, indicating reduced earnings quality and profitability sustainability. The effective tax rate remained negligible and negative, suggesting minimal tax burden. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 with lower net income and margins despite improved gross profit, driven by increased operating expenses and lower revenue. | The company’s profitability improved in 2023 compared to 2022. Revenue increased modestly from $45,808K to $47,366K, a 3.4% growth. Gross profit for 2023 was $26,857K with a gross margin of 143.30%, indicating a highly profitable core business or possible accounting classification effects. Operating income was $10,478K, yielding an operating margin of 22.12%, reflecting effective cost control relative to revenue. Net profit rose from $9,834K in 2022 to $11,514K in 2023, increasing the net profit margin from 21.47% to 24.31%, which signals improved earnings quality and operational efficiency. Return on equity was 9.55% in 2023, demonstrating reasonable returns to shareholders given the equity base. The effective tax rate was negligible at -0.01%, indicating minimal tax expense and contributing to net profitability. Interest expense was $1,245K, but interest coverage was very strong at -841.61%, suggesting earnings comfortably cover interest obligations. Overall, profitability and earnings quality in 2023 improved with higher margins and sustainable net income growth. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating margin decreased from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, indicating reduced operational efficiency and higher relative operating costs. Cost control appears challenged as operating expenses rose despite lower revenue. Asset turnover and return on assets data are unavailable, limiting assessment of asset utilization. However, net cash from operations increased significantly from 17,345 to 20,492, reflecting strong cash generation capability. Inventories decreased from 492 to 404, suggesting improved inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities slightly decreased, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: cash flow from operations improved, but margins and cost control worsened. | Operational efficiency in 2023 shows positive trends. Operating expenses were $21,879K, controlled relative to gross profit of $26,857K, resulting in a healthy operating margin of 22.12%. Although asset turnover data is unavailable, the increase in revenue alongside stable operating income suggests effective asset utilization. Net cash from operations decreased from $20,028K in 2022 to $17,345K in 2023, indicating slightly lower cash generation from core operations despite higher net profit, which may warrant monitoring. Inventories decreased marginally from $539K to $492K, reflecting efficient inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets grew and current liabilities declined, supported by a current ratio increase to 645.58%. These factors collectively indicate good cost control and operational management, though the decline in operating cash flow relative to net income suggests some non-cash earnings components or changes in working capital. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators improved with debt to equity ratio declining from 43.82% to 38.67%, reducing financial risk. Interest expense decreased from -1,245 to -1,066, and interest coverage ratio, while still negative, improved slightly from -841.61% to -754.78%, indicating better ability to cover interest costs. The current ratio increased substantially to 734.52%, signaling strong liquidity and low short-term default risk. The effective tax rate remained negative and minimal, posing no significant tax risk. No data on return on assets or asset turnover limits risk assessment from asset efficiency perspective. Overall, financial risk appears reduced in 2024 due to lower leverage, improved liquidity, and manageable interest expenses. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest a low risk profile. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 43.82% from 48.30% in 2022, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. The current ratio of 645.58% reflects very strong liquidity, minimizing short-term solvency risk. Interest expense was $1,245K, but the interest coverage ratio was extremely high at -841.61%, showing ample earnings to cover interest payments and low default risk. The effective tax rate was effectively zero (-0.01%), which may reflect tax planning or credits but also reduces tax-related risk. No data on return on assets or asset turnover limits assessment of operational risk. Overall, the company exhibits strong liquidity, manageable leverage, and excellent interest coverage, indicating low financial risk and early warning signs of distress are absent. |
| Future financial performance projection | Net cash from investing activities turned positive in 2024 at 40,253 compared to a negative 21,230 in 2023, indicating significant asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures, which may impact future growth. Net cash from financing remained negative but slightly improved from -10,114 to -9,715, with dividends increasing marginally from -2,981 to -3,076, suggesting a stable dividend policy. Revenue by geographic region shows slight declines across Japan, Singapore, and others, with Japan remaining the largest market. Revenue by product shows decreases in both ship owning and agency/logistics segments, indicating potential challenges in core markets. The strong operational cash flow and improved liquidity support sustainability, but declining revenues and increased operating expenses may constrain growth. The positive investing cash flow may reflect asset sales rather than investments, signaling cautious or defensive financial strategy. Overall, future performance may face headwinds from revenue declines and expense pressures, but strong cash flow and liquidity provide a buffer. | Looking forward, the company’s future financial performance may face mixed signals. Net cash from investing activities was negative at $(21,230)K in 2023 compared to a positive $140K in 2022, indicating significant investment outflows likely for growth or asset acquisition. Net cash from financing activities was negative $(10,114)K, larger than the prior year, suggesting debt repayments or dividend payments exceeding new financing. Dividends increased slightly to $(2,981)K, reflecting a stable or growing dividend policy. The net decrease in cash of $(13,999)K in 2023 contrasts with a net increase in 2022, which may pressure liquidity if sustained. Revenue by product shows ship owning as the largest segment at $32,428K, with agency and logistics contributing $14,938K, indicating diversified revenue streams. Geographically, Japan leads with $21,844K, followed by Singapore at $14,801K and others at $10,721K, suggesting focus on Asia-Pacific markets. The investment outflows and stable dividends imply a growth-oriented strategy balanced with shareholder returns. However, the decline in operating cash flow and cash reserves warrants monitoring to ensure cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company appears positioned for growth with active investments and stable dividends but should manage cash flow carefully. |

The Group also monitors industry trends and economic conditions as part of its risk management. | The Group faces market risks related to global transportation and maritime industry volatility, including impacts from geopolitical situations, economic downturns, and demand fluctuations. The business model of long-term charters to top-rated charterers mitigates volatility risk by providing stable income and yield accretions. Revenue concentration risk exists with 62% of trade receivables due from three major customers, though these customers have good standing and no history of default.
