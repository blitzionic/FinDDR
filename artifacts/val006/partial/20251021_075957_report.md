# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue decreased from $47,366K in 2023 to $45,492K in 2024, a decline of approximately 4.0%. Gross margin data is unavailable, limiting direct analysis of cost of goods sold impact. Revenue by product/service shows a decline in both segments: Ship owning revenue fell from $32,428K in 2023 to $31,596K in 2024 (a 2.56% decrease), and Agency and logistics revenue dropped from $14,938K to $13,896K (a 7.01% decrease). Geographically, revenue also declined across all regions: Japan revenue decreased by 1.66% from $21,844K to $21,485K, Singapore revenue fell by 7.56% from $14,801K to $13,682K, and Others declined by 3.72% from $10,721K to $10,325K. The consistent revenue decline across products and regions suggests broad market or operational challenges rather than isolated issues. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income decreased from $10,478K in 2023 to $8,046K in 2024, a 23.2% reduction, which is more pronounced than the 4.0% revenue decline, indicating deteriorating operating efficiency. Operating margin declined from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, a drop of 4.43 percentage points, reflecting increased operating costs or reduced operational leverage. The operating income to revenue relationship weakened, signaling less effective cost management or higher expenses relative to sales. Without detailed operating expense data, the exact drivers are unclear, but the margin compression suggests challenges in controlling operating costs or lower profitability per revenue dollar. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained very low and stable, increasing slightly from 0.01% in 2023 to 0.02% in 2024, indicating minimal tax impact on profitability. Income tax expenses were negative but negligible (-$1K in 2023 and -$2K in 2024), possibly due to tax credits or adjustments. No non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability are not explicitly provided, but the broad-based revenue and margin declines may imply external market pressures or economic conditions impacting demand or cost structures. |
