# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue declined from 47,366K USD in 2023 to 45,492K USD in 2024, a decrease of approximately 4.0%. Gross margin data is unavailable, limiting direct assessment of cost of goods sold impact. Revenue by product/service shows a decline in both segments: Ship owning revenue decreased from 32,428K GBP in 2023 to 31,596K GBP in 2024 (-2.58%), and Agency and logistics revenue fell from 14,938K GBP to 13,896K GBP (-7.01%). Geographically, revenue also declined across all regions: Japan revenue dropped from 21,844K GBP to 21,485K GBP (-1.65%), Singapore from 14,801K GBP to 13,682K GBP (-7.56%), and Others from 10,721K GBP to 10,325K GBP (-3.69%). The consistent decline across products and regions suggests broad market or operational challenges rather than isolated issues. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin decreased from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, indicating a deterioration in operating efficiency. Operating income fell from 10,478K USD in 2023 to 8,046K USD in 2024, a 23.2% reduction, which is steeper than the 4.0% revenue decline, signaling rising operating costs or reduced operational leverage. The operating income to revenue ratio confirms this margin compression. Without detailed operating expense data, precise cost management evaluation is limited, but the margin decline suggests less effective cost control or increased expenses relative to revenue. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained very low and stable, increasing slightly from 0.01% in 2023 to 0.02% in 2024, indicating minimal tax impact on profitability. Income tax expense was negative but negligible (-1K USD in 2023 and -2K USD in 2024), suggesting possible tax credits or adjustments. No non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability cannot be directly identified from the provided data, but the broad revenue and margin declines may imply external market pressures or economic conditions impacting the business. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a stable and slightly improved financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased marginally from 187,278 to 189,104 thousand USD, driven by a rise in current assets from 67,976 to 75,817 thousand USD, despite a decrease in non-current assets from 119,302 to 113,287 thousand USD. Total liabilities rose slightly from 63,955 to 65,781 thousand USD, with current liabilities decreasing from 12,570 to 11,744 thousand USD and non-current liabilities reducing from 56,897 to 54,037 thousand USD. Shareholders' equity strengthened from 117,811 to 123,323 thousand USD, supported by an increase in retained earnings from 84,758 to 90,913 thousand USD. Liquidity improved as reflected by the current ratio rising from 540.78% to 645.58%, indicating enhanced short-term financial flexibility. The debt to equity ratio slightly decreased from 54.29% to 53.34%, suggesting a modest reduction in leverage and a solid capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a sound financial health with asset growth, controlled liabilities, and a stronger equity base in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrates a strong financial position with total assets of 187,278 thousand USD and shareholders' equity of 117,811 thousand USD, indicating a solid equity base. The total liabilities stand at 63,955 thousand USD, with current liabilities at 12,570 thousand USD and non-current liabilities at 56,897 thousand USD. The current ratio is exceptionally high at 540.78%, reflecting excellent liquidity and the ability to cover short-term obligations multiple times over. The debt to equity ratio is moderate at 54.29%, suggesting a balanced capital structure with manageable leverage. The asset composition shows a significant portion in non-current assets (119,302 thousand USD) compared to current assets (67,976 thousand USD), indicating investment in long-term resources. Overall, the balance sheet reflects strong asset growth and prudent liability management, supporting a robust equity position and liquidity profile in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company experienced a decline in revenue from 47,366 thousand USD in 2023 to 45,492 thousand USD in 2024, a decrease of approximately 4%. Operating income decreased from 10,478 to 8,046 thousand USD, and net profit declined from 11,514 to 9,136 thousand USD, indicating reduced profitability. Correspondingly, operating margin dropped from 22.12% to 17.69%, and net profit margin fell from 24.31% to 20.08%, reflecting margin compression. Return on equity for 2024 is 7.58% and return on assets is 4.85%, both indicating moderate returns on invested capital but no prior year data is available for direct comparison. The effective tax rate remained very low but doubled from 0.01% to 0.02%, which is negligible in impact. Interest expense decreased from 1,245 to 1,066 thousand USD, slightly improving earnings quality. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 with lower revenues and margins, but returns remain positive and earnings quality is supported by reduced interest costs. | The company reported revenue of 47,366 thousand USD in 2023, with operating income of 10,478 thousand USD and net profit of 11,514 thousand USD, indicating strong profitability. The operating margin is 22.12%, and the net profit margin is even higher at 24.31%, reflecting efficient cost control and high earnings quality. Income before taxes is 11,515 thousand USD with an effective tax rate of 0.01%, which is unusually low, possibly due to tax benefits or credits. Interest expense is 1,245 thousand USD, but the interest coverage ratio is very high at 841.61%, indicating that earnings comfortably cover interest obligations. The net profit exceeding operating income suggests non-operating income or tax benefits contributing positively to earnings. Overall, profitability metrics indicate sustainable and high-quality earnings in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency declined in 2024 as evidenced by a lower operating margin of 17.69% compared to 22.12% in 2023, indicating higher relative operating expenses or lower pricing power. Asset turnover for 2024 is 24.17, but no prior year data is available for trend analysis. Net cash from operations increased significantly from 17,345 to 20,492 thousand USD, demonstrating strong cash generation despite lower profits. Inventories decreased slightly from 539 to 492 thousand USD, suggesting tighter inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities decreased, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, while profitability margins declined, operational cash flow strength and working capital management improved, indicating effective cost control and asset utilization in cash terms. | Operational efficiency is highlighted by an operating margin of 22.12%, showing effective cost control relative to revenue. Although cost of goods sold and gross profit data are unavailable, the high operating and net margins imply strong operational performance. Net cash from operations is 17,345 thousand USD, exceeding net profit, which suggests good cash conversion and working capital management. Inventories are low at 539 thousand USD, indicating efficient inventory turnover or low inventory holding. The current ratio of 540.78% further supports strong liquidity and operational cash flow management. Asset turnover data is unavailable, limiting analysis of asset utilization, but the available data points to efficient operations and cash flow generation in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show moderate leverage and strong liquidity in 2024. The debt to equity ratio slightly decreased to 53.34% from 54.29%, indicating stable leverage. Interest coverage ratio declined from 841.61% to 754.78%, still very high, suggesting ample ability to cover interest expenses despite a slight reduction. The effective tax rate remains negligible at 0.02%, posing minimal tax risk. Current ratio improved significantly to 645.58% from 540.78%, indicating excellent short-term liquidity and low risk of liquidity distress. Interest expense decreased, reducing financial burden. No significant early warning signs of financial distress are evident, but the decline in profitability margins and interest coverage should be monitored for future risk. | Financial risk appears low in 2023. The debt to equity ratio of 54.29% indicates moderate leverage, not excessive. Interest expense is 1,245 thousand USD, but the interest coverage ratio is extremely high at 841.61%, showing strong ability to meet interest payments from operating earnings. The current ratio of 540.78% signals excellent short-term liquidity, reducing liquidity risk. The effective tax rate is minimal at 0.01%, which may pose some risk if tax conditions change, but currently benefits earnings. No data on contingent liabilities or off-balance sheet risks is provided. Overall, the company exhibits low financial risk with strong liquidity and manageable leverage in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a substantial increase in net cash from investing activities to 40,253 thousand USD from 140 thousand USD in 2023, indicating significant asset acquisitions or investments that may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow to (10,114) thousand USD from (7,994) thousand USD, reflecting higher debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends increased from 2,741 to 2,981 thousand USD, suggesting a stable or slightly more generous dividend policy. Despite strong operational cash flow, the net decrease in cash of (13,999) thousand USD indicates heavy investment outflows. Revenue by product and geography shows slight declines across ship owning and agency/logistics segments and all geographic regions, with Japan remaining the largest market. These trends suggest cautious near-term revenue outlook but potential for growth from recent investments. Overall, the company appears positioned for future growth supported by strong cash flow and investment, balanced with a stable dividend policy. | Investment activities in 2023 show a small positive net cash from investing of 140 thousand USD, indicating limited but positive investment or asset sales. Net cash from financing is negative at (7,994) thousand USD, reflecting debt repayments, dividend payments of 2,741 thousand USD, or share repurchases, suggesting a focus on returning capital to shareholders and deleveraging. The net increase in cash is substantial at 12,174 thousand USD, supporting cash flow sustainability. Revenue by product/service shows a strong contribution from ship owning (32,428 thousand GBP) and agency and logistics (14,938 thousand GBP), while geographically, Japan (21,844 thousand GBP) and Singapore (14,801 thousand GBP) are key markets, indicating diversified revenue streams. These factors suggest stable growth prospects supported by strong cash flows, disciplined capital allocation, and diversified market presence in 2023. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks from global trade fragmentation, rising tariffs, shifting geopolitical alliances, and new policy threats such as potential punitive fees on Chinese-built ships, which could disrupt global supply chains and economic conditions. Demand volatility and changes in customer behavior are implied through the need to adapt agency and logistics services to new trading routes and reduced trade volumes. The Group monitors industry trends and customer bases, with assumptions in impairment testing reflecting anticipated annual revenue growth of 2.5% and stable customer bases. The Group's ship-owning segment relies on long-term charters with high-quality charterers, providing resilience against market uncertainties. | The Group faces market risks related to global transportation and maritime industry volatility, including impacts from geopolitical situations, economic downturns, and demand fluctuations. The Group's business model of long-term charters to top-rated charterers mitigates exposure to market volatility, providing stable income and yield accretions.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The 2024 annual report highlights several economic challenges and uncertainties impacting the Group's business performance. These include a fragmented and uncertain global trade environment characterized by rising tariffs, shifting geopolitical alliances, and potential punitive fees on Chinese-built ships, which could disrupt global supply chains and create economic dislocation. The Group faces cost pressures from increased operating expenses and reduced trade volumes due to global uncertainty. Foreign currency risk is significant, primarily related to the Singapore Dollar, with transactional exposures that could affect profit before tax. Interest rate risk is managed prudently, but changes in interest rates remain a risk factor. Credit risk is monitored closely, with concentration risks from major customers and potential defaults considered. The Group also faces liquidity risk from mismatches in financial asset and liability maturities but manages this through cash flow monitoring and maintaining sufficient liquidity. Additionally, climate-related matters introduce uncertainty in estimates and assumptions, with potential impacts from physical and transition risks due to new climate legislation. The Group's financial structure, including fixed-rate borrowings and a strong capital base, provides resilience against some economic risks, but ongoing market and economic uncertainties remain a challenge. | The Group faces economic challenges including inflation, demand fluctuations, and congestion issues persisting through 2024, which have impacted revenue and profitability. The shipping industry's decarbonisation efforts to meet 2030 International Maritime Organization targets necessitate a shift to Bio-LNG energy vessels, representing both a challenge and an opportunity. The Group manages interest rate risk through interest rate swaps, mitigating exposure to rising interest rates. Foreign currency risk arises primarily from exposure to the Singapore Dollar, with management employing hedging strategies such as foreign exchange options and forward contracts. Credit risk is managed by trading with creditworthy parties and monitoring receivables, with expected credit losses considered immaterial. Liquidity risk is addressed by ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet obligations under normal and stressed conditions. The Group's business model of long-term charters to top-rated charterers provides stable income and cushions against economic downturns and geopolitical market swings. However, economic uncertainties remain due to market changes and circumstances beyond the Group's control, including potential changes in vessel depreciation due to technological developments and usage levels. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The report indicates competitive pressures primarily through the need to maintain fleet competitiveness and strong customer relationships in a challenging global trade environment.

While specific new market entrants or direct competitive threats are not detailed, the emphasis on operational excellence, sustainability, and innovation reflects the competitive pressures from both established players and disruptive market trends in the shipping and logistics industry. | The Group operates in a competitive maritime and logistics industry characterized by established players and evolving market dynamics.
