# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue decreased from 47,366K USD in 2023 to 45,492K USD in 2024, a decline of approximately 3.97%. Gross margin data is unavailable, limiting direct analysis of cost of goods sold impact. Revenue by product/service shows a decline in both segments: Ship owning revenue fell from 32,428K GBP in 2023 to 31,596K GBP in 2024 (a 2.56% decrease), and Agency and logistics revenue dropped from 14,938K GBP to 13,896K GBP (a 7.01% decrease). Geographically, revenue also declined across all regions: Japan revenue decreased from 21,844K GBP to 21,485K GBP (1.65% decrease), Singapore from 14,801K GBP to 13,682K GBP (7.56% decrease), and Others from 10,721K GBP to 10,325K GBP (3.69% decrease). The consistent decline across products and regions suggests broad market or operational challenges rather than isolated issues. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income decreased from 10,478K USD in 2023 to 8,046K USD in 2024, a 23.22% reduction, which is more pronounced than the revenue decline, indicating some deterioration in operating efficiency. Operating margin declined from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, reflecting reduced profitability from core operations. The operating income to revenue ratio confirms this trend, with operating income representing a smaller portion of revenue in 2024. Without detailed operating expense data, precise cost management assessment is limited, but the sharper drop in operating income relative to revenue suggests increased operating costs or reduced operational leverage. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased slightly from 0.01% in 2023 to 0.02% in 2024, remaining very low and having minimal impact on net profitability. Income tax expense is negative in both years (-1K USD in 2023 and -2K USD in 2024), indicating tax benefits or credits rather than expenses. Net profit decreased from 11,514K USD in 2023 to 9,136K USD in 2024, a 20.62% decline, less severe than the operating income drop, possibly due to these tax benefits. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported. External factors affecting profitability cannot be directly identified from the data but the across-the-board revenue and margin declines may imply market or economic headwinds. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing modestly from 189,103 to 193,901 thousand USD, indicating asset growth. Current assets grew from 75,817 to 84,294 thousand USD, while non-current assets decreased from 113,287 to 108,609 thousand USD, suggesting a shift towards more liquid assets. Total liabilities decreased from 65,607 to 62,071 thousand USD, reflecting effective liability management. Both current and non-current liabilities declined slightly, supporting improved balance sheet strength. Shareholders' equity increased from 123,323 to 130,832 thousand USD, driven by higher retained earnings (from 90,913 to 99,219 thousand USD), enhancing the equity position. The current ratio improved significantly from 645.58% to 734.52%, indicating strong liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 53.20% to 47.44%, showing a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained a robust financial health profile in 2024 with asset growth, reduced liabilities, and strengthened equity and liquidity positions. | In 2023, the company demonstrates a strong financial position with total assets of 189,103 thousand USD and shareholders' equity of 123,323 thousand USD, indicating a solid equity base. The total liabilities stand at 65,607 thousand USD, with current liabilities at 11,744 thousand USD and non-current liabilities at 54,037 thousand USD. The current ratio is exceptionally high at 645.58%, reflecting excellent liquidity and the company's ability to cover short-term obligations comfortably. The debt to equity ratio of 53.20% suggests a moderate leverage level, indicating prudent liability management and a balanced capital structure. Asset composition shows a significant portion in non-current assets (113,287 thousand USD) compared to current assets (75,817 thousand USD), supporting long-term operational capacity. Overall, the balance sheet strength and liquidity position in 2023 are robust, providing a stable foundation for ongoing operations and growth. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined slightly from 47,366 to 45,492 thousand USD in 2024, a decrease of approximately 4%. Operating income decreased from 10,478 to 8,046 thousand USD, a reduction of about 23%, indicating pressure on operating profitability. Net profit also declined from 11,514 to 9,136 thousand USD, a drop of roughly 21%. Operating margin fell from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, and net profit margin decreased from 24.31% to 20.08%, reflecting margin compression. Return on equity was 7.19% and return on assets was 4.77% in 2024, with no prior year data for direct comparison, but these returns suggest moderate earnings quality and sustainability. The effective tax rate remained very low but doubled from 0.01% to 0.02%, having minimal impact on net profitability. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 with lower revenues and margins, but the company maintained positive returns indicating earnings sustainability despite margin pressures. | The company reported revenue of 47,366 thousand USD in 2023, with operating income of 10,478 thousand USD and net profit of 11,514 thousand USD, reflecting strong profitability. The operating margin is 22.12%, and the net profit margin is even higher at 24.31%, indicating efficient cost control and high earnings quality. The effective tax rate is minimal at 0.01%, which positively impacts net profitability. Interest expense is relatively low at 1,245 thousand USD, and the interest coverage ratio is very high at 841.61%, underscoring the company's strong ability to meet interest obligations from operating earnings. Income before taxes closely matches net profit, confirming minimal tax impact and consistent earnings. Although return on equity and return on assets are not available, the high margins and net profit relative to equity suggest sustainable earnings quality for 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating margin declined from 22.12% to 17.69%, indicating reduced cost control or increased operating expenses relative to revenue. Asset turnover was 23.76% in 2024, but no prior year data is available for trend analysis; this ratio suggests the company generated approximately 0.2376 USD in revenue per USD of assets, which is relatively low and may indicate underutilization of assets. Net cash from operations increased significantly from 17,345 to 20,492 thousand USD, reflecting strong cash generation despite lower reported profits. Inventories decreased from 492 to 404 thousand USD, indicating improved inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities slightly decreased, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with declining margins and moderate asset utilization but strong operational cash flow and improved working capital management. | Operational efficiency in 2023 is highlighted by an operating margin of 22.12%, indicating effective cost management relative to revenue. The company generated net cash from operations of 17,345 thousand USD, which exceeds net profit, suggesting strong cash conversion and quality earnings. Working capital appears very strong given the current assets of 75,817 thousand USD against current liabilities of 11,744 thousand USD, supporting smooth operational liquidity. Asset turnover data is unavailable, limiting analysis of asset utilization, but the high operating margin and cash flow from operations imply efficient use of resources. Inventory levels are low at 492 thousand USD, which may indicate lean inventory management or a service-oriented business model. Overall, the company demonstrates solid operational efficiency and cash flow generation in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio fell from 53.20% to 47.44%, reducing financial risk. Interest expense declined from 1,245 to 1,066 thousand USD, easing interest burden. Interest coverage ratio remained very high at 754.78% in 2024, down from 841.61% in 2023, indicating ample ability to cover interest expenses from operating income despite the decline. The effective tax rate remained negligible at 0.02%, posing minimal tax risk. Liquidity improved with the current ratio rising from 645.58% to 734.52%, indicating strong short-term solvency. However, net cash from financing activities was negative and increased in outflow from (7,994) to (10,114) thousand USD, which may indicate higher debt repayments or dividend payments, potentially impacting liquidity if sustained. Overall, financial risk is low with strong liquidity and coverage ratios, but the increased financing cash outflow warrants monitoring. | Financial risk indicators for 2023 show a moderate leverage profile with a debt to equity ratio of 53.20%, which is manageable and not excessive. The extremely high current ratio of 645.58% indicates very low liquidity risk, with ample current assets to cover short-term liabilities. Interest expense is relatively low at 1,245 thousand USD, and the interest coverage ratio of 841.61% signals negligible risk of interest payment default. The effective tax rate is almost zero at 0.01%, which may reflect tax planning or credits but also suggests minimal tax burden risk. No significant red flags emerge from the data regarding financial risk; the company appears well-positioned to meet its obligations and withstand financial stress in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities showed a significant increase in net cash from investing from 140 to 40,253 thousand USD, indicating substantial asset acquisitions or investments in 2024, which may support future growth. Despite strong operational cash flow (20,492 thousand USD), the company experienced a net decrease in cash of (13,999) thousand USD, likely due to heavy investing and financing outflows. Dividends increased from 2,741 to 2,981 thousand USD, reflecting a stable or slightly more generous dividend policy, supported by retained earnings growth. Revenue by product/service and geographic region declined slightly across all segments, with ship owning revenue decreasing from £32,428 to £31,596 and agency and logistics from £14,938 to £13,896; geographically, Japan, Singapore, and others all saw modest declines. These trends suggest cautious near-term growth prospects but potential for future expansion driven by recent investments. Overall, the company appears positioned for future growth supported by investment activities and strong cash flow, though revenue softness and cash outflows require careful management. | Investment activities in 2023 show a small positive net cash from investing of 140 thousand USD, indicating limited but positive investment outflows or asset sales. Net cash from financing is negative at (7,994) thousand USD, which, combined with dividend payments of 2,741 thousand USD, suggests the company is returning capital to shareholders and possibly reducing debt or repurchasing shares. The net increase in cash of 12,174 thousand USD supports strong cash flow sustainability. Revenue segmentation by product/service shows ship owning as the largest contributor (£32,428 thousand) followed by agency and logistics (£14,938 thousand), while geographic revenue is concentrated in Japan (£21,844 thousand) and Singapore (£14,801 thousand), with others contributing £10,721 thousand. These segments and regions may guide future growth focus. Overall, the company’s cash flow profile and investment pattern in 2023 indicate a stable outlook with potential for continued shareholder returns and targeted growth in key markets and services. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The 2024 annual report highlights several economic challenges and uncertainties impacting the Group's business performance. These include the fragmented and uncertain global trade environment characterized by rising tariffs, shifting geopolitical alliances, and potential punitive fees on Chinese-built ships, which could disrupt global supply chains and create economic dislocation. The Group faces cost pressures from increased operational expenses and reduced trade volumes due to global uncertainty. Foreign currency risk is significant, primarily related to the Singapore Dollar, with transactional exposures that could affect profit before tax. Interest rate risk is managed through swaps, but variable rates pose cash flow uncertainties. Credit risk is monitored closely, with concentration risks from major customers and potential defaults. Liquidity risk arises from mismatches in financial asset and liability maturities, requiring careful cash flow management. Additionally, the Group considers climate-related risks, including physical and transition risks, which increase uncertainty in estimates and assumptions affecting financial statements. Unutilised tax losses and deferred tax assets recognition also present uncertainties dependent on future taxable profits. Overall, macroeconomic factors, market conditions, cost pressures, and economic uncertainties such as geopolitical tensions and currency fluctuations pose forward-looking challenges to revenue and profitability. | The Group faces economic challenges including inflation, demand fluctuations, and congestion issues persisting through 2024, which have impacted the global transportation and maritime industry. Macroeconomic uncertainties such as interest rate risk are managed through interest rate swaps to hedge against variable rate exposures, with the Group having fully hedged interest rate exposures to match long charter tenures at an attractive all-in interest rate of 3.24%, cushioning it from the rising interest rate environment. Foreign currency risk arises primarily from exposure to the Singapore Dollar, with management employing foreign exchange options and forward contracts to mitigate this risk. The Group's business model, relying on long-term charters to top-rated charterers, provides stable income and shields it from volatility in global supply chains and economic downturns. However, cost pressures and market conditions remain uncertain, with the Group monitoring cash flow requirements closely to manage liquidity risk. The Group also faces estimation uncertainties related to depreciation and residual values of vessels, which could impact financial results depending on technological developments and usage levels. Overall, economic uncertainties include inflationary pressures, interest rate fluctuations, foreign currency exposure, and market demand variability that could affect revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The report indicates competitive pressures primarily through the need to maintain fleet competitiveness and strong customer relationships in a challenging global trade environment. The ship-owning segment relies on long-term charters with high-quality charterers, underscoring the importance of maintaining a competitive fleet and service quality. The agency and logistics business has adapted to changing trade landscapes by offering differentiated and agile solutions to help clients realign supply chains and respond to new trading routes, indicating competitive dynamics requiring innovation and responsiveness. The Group is embracing digitalisation, AI, and exploring greener fleet investments aligned with international net-zero agendas to address technological disruption and evolving industry standards. While specific new market entrants or direct competitive threats are not detailed, the emphasis on operational excellence, sustainability, and innovation reflects the competitive pressures from established players and the need to stay ahead of industry dynamics and technological changes. | The 2023 annual report does not explicitly discuss competitive pressures or market competition. There is no direct mention of challenges from established industry players, new disruptive entrants, technological disruption, or industry dynamics affecting the Group's market position.
