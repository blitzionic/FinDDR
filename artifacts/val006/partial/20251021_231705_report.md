# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue showed a slight decline from 47,366 in 2023 to 45,492 in 2024, a decrease of approximately 3.98%, after a modest increase of 3.34% from 45,808 in 2022 to 47,366 in 2023. Gross profit decreased from 27,692 in 2023 to 23,550 in 2024, reflecting a significant drop in gross margin from 58.46% in 2023 to an unusually high 148.23% in 2024, indicating possible data inconsistency or extraordinary accounting adjustments. Revenue by product/service shows a decline in both segments: Ship owning revenue decreased from 32,428 in 2023 to 31,596 in 2024 (-2.56%), and Agency and logistics revenue fell from 14,938 to 13,896 (-7.01%). Geographically, revenue slightly decreased across all regions: Japan from 21,844 to 21,485 (-1.65%), Singapore from 14,801 to 13,682 (-7.54%), and Others from 10,721 to 10,325 (-3.69%). The distribution remains relatively stable with Japan contributing the largest share (~47%), followed by Singapore (~30%) and Others (~23%) in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income declined from 10,478 in 2023 to 8,046 in 2024, a 23.22% decrease, while operating margin dropped from 22.12% to 17.69%, indicating reduced operational profitability. The operating expense figure for 2024 is reported as -23,902, which contrasts with 17,114 in 2023, suggesting possible classification or reporting anomalies. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows a weakening efficiency, as operating income fell more sharply than revenue. Cost management appears challenged in 2024 given the decline in operating margin and operating income despite only a moderate revenue decrease, implying increased costs or inefficiencies. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained negative but very low, moving from (0.01%) in 2023 to (0.02%) in 2024, indicating minimal tax expense or possibly tax benefits impacting net profitability. Income tax expense is minimal and negative (-2 in 2024, -1 in 2023), suggesting tax credits or adjustments. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data, but the abnormal gross margin and operating expense figures hint at potential one-off accounting impacts or external factors affecting profitability. External factors are not detailed, but the overall decline in revenue and profitability metrics may reflect market or operational challenges in 2024. |
