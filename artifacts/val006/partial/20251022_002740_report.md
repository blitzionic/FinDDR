# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue increased slightly from 45,808 to 47,366 thousand USD, a growth of approximately 3.4%. However, revenue declined by about 4.0% from 2023 to 2024, falling to 45,492 thousand USD. Gross profit improved from 27,392 thousand USD in 2023 to 28,550 thousand USD in 2024, despite the revenue decline, resulting in a significant gross margin increase from 57.83% in 2023 to an unusually high 137.24% in 2024, indicating possible data anomalies or reclassification of costs. Revenue by product/service shows a decline in both segments: Ship owning revenue decreased from £32,428k in 2023 to £31,596k in 2024 (a 2.6% drop), and Agency and logistics revenue fell from £14,938k to £13,896k (a 7.0% drop). Geographically, revenue distribution remained relatively stable with slight decreases across all regions: Japan revenue decreased by 1.7% (from £21,844k to £21,485k), Singapore by 7.6% (from £14,801k to £13,682k), and Others by 3.7% (from £10,721k to £10,325k). Overall, the company experienced modest revenue contraction in 2024 with improved gross profit margins, but declines in both product and geographic revenue streams. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, reflecting a deterioration in operating efficiency. Operating income dropped from 10,478 thousand USD in 2023 to 8,046 thousand USD in 2024, a 23.2% decrease, which is disproportionate to the 4.0% revenue decline, indicating increased operating expenses or reduced operational leverage. Operating expenses appear inconsistent with the income statement data, showing -23,972 thousand USD in 2024 versus 17,314 thousand USD in 2023, suggesting possible data entry issues; however, assuming expenses increased, cost management effectiveness weakened. The operating income to revenue relationship worsened, signaling challenges in controlling costs or maintaining operational profitability despite stable revenue levels. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained negative and minimal, at -0.02% in 2024 and -0.01% in 2023, indicating negligible tax expenses or possible tax credits/refunds, which positively impacted net profitability. Net profit decreased from 11,514 thousand USD in 2023 to 9,136 thousand USD in 2024, a 20.6% decline, consistent with lower operating income. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability are not detailed, but the negative tax rates and unusual gross margin figures suggest potential accounting or reporting anomalies that may have influenced reported profitability metrics. |
