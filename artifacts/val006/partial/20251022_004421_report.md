# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue increased slightly by 3.34% from 45,808 to 47,366 USD thousands, but then declined by 4.04% to 45,492 USD thousands in 2024. Gross profit improved from 27,452 USD thousands in 2023 to 28,750 USD thousands in 2024, despite the revenue decline, resulting in a significant gross margin increase from 57.96% in 2023 to an unusually high 136.80% in 2024, indicating possible data inconsistency or extraordinary cost adjustments. Revenue by product shows a decline in both segments: Ship owning revenue decreased by 2.56% from 32,428 to 31,596 USD thousands, and Agency and logistics revenue fell by 7.01% from 14,938 to 13,896 USD thousands between 2023 and 2024. Geographically, revenue in Japan decreased by 1.68% to 21,485 USD thousands, Singapore revenue dropped by 7.56% to 13,682 USD thousands, and revenue from other regions declined by 3.72% to 10,325 USD thousands, indicating a broad-based revenue contraction across regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating efficiency. Operating income decreased by 23.22% from 10,478 to 8,046 USD thousands, while revenue decreased by 4.04%, indicating operating income fell disproportionately relative to revenue. Operating expenses increased from 17,474 USD thousands in 2023 to 23,272 USD thousands in 2024, a 33.13% increase, which suggests deteriorating cost management despite lower revenue. This rise in operating expenses alongside declining revenue and operating income points to inefficiencies or increased costs that negatively impacted profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained negative and minimal, at -0.01% in 2023 and -0.02% in 2024, indicating tax benefits or credits slightly increasing net profit. Income tax expense was negligible and slightly negative (-1 USD thousand in 2023 and -2 USD thousands in 2024), suggesting minimal tax burden or possible tax refunds. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability are not detailed, but the unusual gross margin and increased operating expenses may imply extraordinary cost adjustments or accounting treatments impacting reported profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a stable and slightly improved financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased marginally from 187,278 to 189,104 thousand USD, driven by a rise in current assets from 67,976 to 75,817 thousand USD, despite a decrease in non-current assets from 119,302 to 113,287 thousand USD. Total liabilities decreased from 69,467 to 65,781 thousand USD, reflecting effective liability management, with both current liabilities and non-current liabilities declining. Shareholders' equity strengthened from 117,811 to 123,323 thousand USD, supported by an increase in retained earnings from 84,758 to 90,913 thousand USD. Liquidity improved as indicated by the current ratio rising from 540.78% to 645.58%, and the debt to equity ratio decreased from 58.96% to 53.34%, signaling a more conservative capital structure and reduced leverage risk. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing to $187,278K from $178,844K in 2022, reflecting asset growth of approximately 4.7%. This growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in current assets from $54,239K to $67,976K, while non-current assets slightly decreased from $124,605K to $119,302K. Total liabilities decreased from $72,941K in 2022 to $69,467K in 2023, indicating effective liability management. Current liabilities remained relatively stable, while non-current liabilities declined by about 5.7%. Shareholders' equity strengthened notably by 11.2% to $117,811K, supported by retained earnings holding steady at $84,758K. The current ratio improved substantially from 428.36% to 540.78%, indicating enhanced liquidity and strong short-term financial health. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 68.88% to 58.96%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet strength improved in 2023 with asset growth, reduced liabilities, and increased equity, supporting a robust financial foundation. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined slightly from 47,366 to 45,492 thousand USD in 2024, a decrease of approximately 4%. Despite this, gross profit increased from 27,452 to 28,750 thousand USD, resulting in an exceptional gross margin improvement from 57.96% to 136.80%, which is unusual and suggests possible data anomalies or accounting adjustments in cost of goods sold. Operating income decreased from 10,478 to 8,046 thousand USD, and operating margin declined from 22.12% to 17.69%. Net profit also fell from 11,514 to 9,136 thousand USD, with net profit margin decreasing from 24.31% to 20.08%. Return on equity and return on assets both declined, from 10.29% to 7.58% and 6.29% to 4.85% respectively, indicating reduced earnings efficiency and sustainability. The effective tax rate remained negligible and negative, consistent with prior year, suggesting minimal tax burden or tax credits. | The company’s profitability improved in 2023 with revenue increasing modestly by 3.4% to $47,366K from $45,808K in 2022. Gross profit was $27,452K, yielding a strong gross margin of 57.96%. Operating income stood at $10,478K with an operating margin of 22.12%, indicating effective cost control relative to revenue. Net profit increased by 17.1% to $11,514K, resulting in a net profit margin of 24.31%, up from 21.47% in 2022, signaling improved earnings quality and operational leverage. Return on equity was 10.29% and return on assets was 6.29%, demonstrating reasonable returns on invested capital and asset base. The effective tax rate was effectively zero (-0.01%), likely due to tax benefits or adjustments, which positively impacted net earnings. Interest expense was $1,245K, but interest coverage was very strong at (841.61%), indicating earnings comfortably cover interest obligations. Overall, 2023 showed improved profitability, higher margins, and sustainable earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses showed a significant negative value in 2024 (-23,272 thousand USD) compared to 17,474 thousand USD in 2023, which may indicate accounting reclassifications or extraordinary items affecting cost control analysis. Asset turnover decreased slightly from 25.87% to 24.17%, reflecting a minor reduction in asset utilization efficiency. Net cash from operations improved notably from 17,345 to 20,492 thousand USD, indicating stronger cash generation despite lower reported operating income. Inventories decreased slightly from 539 to 492 thousand USD, suggesting tighter inventory management. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with improved cash flow but unusual expense reporting requiring further investigation. | Operational efficiency in 2023 was strong, with an operating margin of 22.12% reflecting good cost control relative to revenue. The asset turnover ratio was exceptionally high at 25.87, indicating highly efficient use of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations declined by 13.4% to $17,345K from $20,028K in 2022, suggesting some reduction in cash generation efficiency or changes in working capital. Inventories were low at $539K, which may contribute to efficient working capital management. Despite the decline in operating cash flow, the company maintained positive cash flow from operations, supporting ongoing operational activities. Overall, the company demonstrated strong asset utilization and maintained operational profitability, though cash flow from operations showed some contraction. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators improved with debt to equity ratio declining from 58.96% to 53.34%, and total liabilities decreasing. Interest expense reduced from 1,245 to 1,066 thousand USD, improving interest burden. Interest coverage ratio, while still negative, improved slightly from (841.61%) to (754.78%), indicating better ability to cover interest expenses from operating income. Liquidity strengthened as current ratio increased significantly. The effective tax rate remained negative and minimal, posing no immediate tax risk. Overall, financial risk appears reduced with lower leverage, improved liquidity, and manageable interest costs, though the negative interest coverage ratio suggests some caution in earnings volatility. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest a relatively low risk profile. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 58.96% from 68.88% in 2022, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. The current ratio improved significantly to 540.78%, reflecting excellent liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense was $1,245K, but the interest coverage ratio was extremely high at (841.61%), indicating very strong capacity to service debt. The effective tax rate was negative (-0.01%), which may reflect tax credits or adjustments, reducing tax burden risk. No significant increases in liabilities or interest costs were noted. Overall, the company’s leverage and liquidity metrics indicate low financial risk and strong capacity to meet financial obligations in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a dramatic reversal with net cash from investing turning positive at 40,253 thousand USD compared to a negative 21,230 thousand USD in 2023, indicating asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures which may impact future growth. Net cash from financing remained negative and stable around (9,715) thousand USD, with dividends slightly increased from (2,981) to (3,076) thousand USD, reflecting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue by product and geographic segments declined slightly across ship owning, agency and logistics, and key regions (Japan, Singapore, Others), suggesting modest contraction or market challenges. The strong cash flow from operations and improved liquidity position support sustainability, but the reduced investment outflows and declining revenues may signal cautious growth outlook in the near term. | Looking ahead, the company’s future financial performance may face challenges due to significant investing cash outflows of $(21,230)K in 2023, compared to a small positive investing cash flow in 2022, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that could drive future growth. Financing cash outflows increased to $(10,114)K from $(7,994)K, with dividends paid rising substantially to $(2,981)K from $(1,052)K, suggesting a more aggressive dividend policy that may impact cash reserves. The net decrease in cash of $(13,999)K in 2023 contrasts with a net increase in 2022, signaling potential liquidity pressure if cash outflows persist. Revenue concentration is notable in Japan ($21,844K) and Singapore ($14,801K), with ship owning ($32,428K) and agency and logistics ($14,938K) as key segments, indicating geographic and segment focus that may influence growth opportunities. Overall, while investment activities suggest growth orientation, cash flow sustainability and dividend policy warrant monitoring to ensure balanced financial health going forward. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks related to global trade environment uncertainties including rising tariffs, shifting geopolitical alliances, and potential punitive fees on Chinese-built ships, which may disrupt global supply chains and impact demand. The agency and logistics business is exposed to reduced trade volumes and costlier operations due to global uncertainty. The Group monitors industry trends and customer behavior, maintaining long-term charters with high-quality charterers to ensure resilient earnings. The Group also considers climate-related risks, including physical and transition risks, which increase uncertainty in estimates and assumptions. Management actively monitors these risks and adapts business strategies accordingly. | The Group faces market risks related to global transportation and maritime industry volatility, including impacts from geopolitical situations, economic downturns, and demand fluctuations. The business model of long-term charters to top-rated charterers mitigates exposure to supply chain volatility, providing stable income and yield assurance. Revenue concentration risk exists with 62% of trade receivables due from three major customers, though these customers have good standing and no history of default. The Group anticipates industry shifts towards decarbonisation, including adoption of Bio-LNG energy vessels, which presents both challenges and growth opportunities. Management monitors market conditions and customer behavior to adapt strategies accordingly. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include challenges in business operations such as supply chain disruptions, technology systems, human resources, and product development.

| Financial Risks | Financial risks identified include credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables, managed by trading only with creditworthy parties and ongoing monitoring of receivables. The Group uses expected credit loss models and has policies to write off impaired financial assets. Liquidity risk is managed by ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities under normal and stressed conditions through close cash flow monitoring and investment optimization. Foreign currency risk mainly involves exposure to the Singapore Dollar, managed by matching borrowings to cash flows and using forward exchange contracts. Interest rate risk from variable rate borrowings is mitigated by interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
