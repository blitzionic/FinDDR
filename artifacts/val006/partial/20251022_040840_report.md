# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue increased slightly from 45,808 to 47,366 (3.38% growth), but then declined to 45,492 in 2024 (a 4.01% decrease from 2023). Gross margin showed an unusual pattern: 58.09% in 2023 but an anomalous 100.01% in 2024, likely due to data inconsistencies in Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) reported as negative in 2024 (-6,514) versus positive in 2023 (19,849). Revenue by product/service remained relatively stable with Ship owning revenue slightly decreasing from 32,428 in 2023 to 31,596 in 2024 (2.56% decline), and Agency and logistics revenue declining from 14,938 to 13,896 (7.01% decline). Geographic revenue distribution also showed minor declines across all regions: Japan revenue decreased from 21,844 to 21,485 (1.65%), Singapore from 14,801 to 13,682 (7.54%), and Others from 10,721 to 10,325 (3.69%). Overall, revenue streams are slightly contracting with stable product mix but geographic revenues are declining moderately, indicating potential market pressures or competitive challenges. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, reflecting reduced operational efficiency. Operating income dropped from 10,478 in 2023 to 8,046 in 2024 (a 23.22% decrease), while revenue decreased by 4.01%, indicating operating income fell disproportionately relative to revenue. Operating expenses increased significantly in absolute terms from 17,439 in 2023 to 30,932 in 2024, suggesting deteriorated cost management or increased overheads. The negative operating expense figure in 2024 (-30,932) compared to positive 17,439 in 2023 may indicate data inconsistency or reclassification, but the trend implies rising costs that outpaced revenue, pressuring margins and operational profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted from a positive 1% in 2023 to a negative (0.02%) in 2024, indicating a tax benefit or credit impacting net profitability. Income tax expense changed from a positive 1 in 2023 to a negative 2 in 2024, which is unusual and suggests non-recurring tax adjustments or benefits. Net profit declined from 11,514 in 2023 to 9,136 in 2024 (20.62% decrease), with net profit margin falling from 24.31% to 20.08%. No explicit non-recurring items are reported, but the tax anomalies and cost inconsistencies hint at unusual accounting or external factors affecting profitability in 2024. External factors such as market conditions or regulatory changes may have influenced these tax and cost patterns. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a stable overall financial position with total assets slightly increasing from $187,278K in 2023 to $189,104K. Current assets grew notably from $67,976K to $75,817K, indicating improved liquidity. Non-current assets decreased from $119,302K to $113,287K, suggesting possible asset disposals or depreciation. Total liabilities declined from $69,467K to $65,781K, reflecting effective liability management. Both current and non-current liabilities decreased, supporting a stronger balance sheet. Shareholders' equity increased from $117,811K to $123,323K, driven by higher retained earnings ($90,913K vs. $84,758K), enhancing the equity base. The current ratio improved significantly from 540.78% to 645.58%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 58.96% to 53.34%, showing reduced leverage and a more conservative capital structure. Overall, the company demonstrates solid financial health with asset growth, reduced liabilities, and strengthened equity and liquidity positions in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from $178,844K in 2022 to $187,278K, reflecting asset growth primarily in current assets which rose from $54,239K to $67,976K, while non-current assets remained stable at $119,302K. Total liabilities decreased from $72,941K to $69,467K, driven by a reduction in non-current liabilities from $65,026K to $56,897K, despite an increase in current liabilities from $7,915K to $12,570K. Shareholders' equity strengthened significantly, rising from $105,903K to $117,811K, indicating improved capital structure and retained earnings stability at $84,758K. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, decreased from 685.27% to 540.78%, still indicating strong short-term financial health. The debt to equity ratio improved from 68.88% to 58.96%, showing effective liability management and a more conservative leverage profile. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined slightly from $47,366K in 2023 to $45,492K in 2024, a decrease of about 4%. Despite this, gross profit increased substantially from $27,517K to $38,978K, driven by a negative cost of goods sold figure in 2024 (-$6,514K), which is unusual and may indicate accounting adjustments or reversals. Gross margin rose dramatically to 100.01% from 58.09%, an exceptional improvement. Operating income decreased from $10,478K to $8,046K, and operating margin declined from 22.12% to 17.69%, indicating higher operating expenses or cost structure changes despite gross profit gains. Net profit fell from $11,514K to $9,136K, with net profit margin decreasing from 24.31% to 20.08%. Return on equity dropped from 10.29% to 7.58%, and return on assets declined from 6.29% to 4.85%, reflecting lower earnings efficiency relative to equity and assets. The effective tax rate turned negative (-0.02%) from near zero, possibly due to tax credits or adjustments. Overall, while gross profitability improved markedly, operating and net profitability weakened, and returns on capital declined, raising questions about earnings sustainability and quality in 2024. | The company’s revenue increased modestly by 3.4% from $45,808K in 2022 to $47,366K in 2023, with ship owning revenue growing slightly from $31,596K to $32,428K, while agency and logistics revenue remained flat at $14,938K. Gross profit for 2023 was $27,517K, yielding a strong gross margin of 58.09%. Operating income stood at $10,478K with an operating margin of 22.12%, reflecting effective cost control given operating expenses of $17,439K. Net profit increased by 17.1% from $9,834K to $11,514K, improving the net profit margin from 21.47% to 24.31%. Return on equity was 10.29% and return on assets was 6.29%, indicating reasonable earnings quality and sustainability. The exceptionally low effective tax rate of 0.01% and minimal income tax expense of $1K suggest tax efficiency or tax-related benefits impacting net profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses in 2024 were reported as negative (-$30,932K) compared to $17,439K in 2023, which is highly unusual and suggests significant accounting anomalies or reversals. Operating margin decreased from 22.12% to 17.69%, indicating reduced operational efficiency. Asset turnover declined slightly from 25.87% to 24.17%, showing marginally less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased from $17,345K to $20,492K, reflecting improved cash generation despite lower reported operating income. Inventories decreased slightly from $539K to $492K, indicating tighter inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities decreased, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with improved cash flow but unusual expense reporting and slightly lower asset utilization in 2024. | Operational efficiency in 2023 is highlighted by a robust operating margin of 22.12%, indicating good cost control relative to revenue. The asset turnover ratio of 25.87% suggests high efficiency in utilizing assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations was strong at $17,345K, supporting operational liquidity and working capital needs. Inventories were minimal at $539K, indicating lean inventory management. Despite increased current liabilities, the company maintained positive operational cash flow, which supports ongoing operations and investment activities. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators improved with debt to equity ratio decreasing from 58.96% to 53.34%, indicating reduced financial risk. The current ratio increased significantly to 645.58% from 540.78%, reflecting strong liquidity and low short-term risk. Interest expense turned negative (-$1,066K) from $1,245K, and interest coverage ratio shifted dramatically from a very high positive 841.61% to a negative -754.78%, which is abnormal and suggests possible accounting irregularities or interest income exceeding interest expense. The effective tax rate moved from near zero to negative, indicating tax benefits or adjustments that may affect future tax liabilities. These unusual figures in interest and tax metrics warrant caution as potential early warning signs. Overall, the company shows reduced leverage and strong liquidity but unusual interest and tax figures that may pose financial risk or require further investigation. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a moderate leverage profile with a debt to equity ratio of 58.96%, improved from 68.88% in 2022, reducing financial risk. Interest expense was $1,245K, but the interest coverage ratio was exceptionally high at 841.61%, indicating strong ability to meet interest obligations. Liquidity remains strong with a current ratio of 540.78%, though it declined from the prior year. The near-zero effective tax rate and minimal income tax expense may pose regulatory or sustainability risks if tax conditions change. The increase in current liabilities from $7,915K to $12,570K warrants monitoring for short-term liquidity pressures. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a significant positive net cash from investing of $40,253K compared to a negative $21,230K in 2023, indicating substantial asset sales or divestitures rather than acquisitions. Net cash from financing remained negative at $9,715K, slightly improved from $10,114K, reflecting continued debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends increased slightly from $2,981K to $3,076K, suggesting a stable dividend policy. The large net increase in cash of $51,030K in 2024 versus a decrease in 2023 indicates strong cash flow sustainability. Revenue by product/service and geographic region declined slightly across all segments, with ship owning revenue down from $32,428K to $31,596K and agency and logistics from $14,938K to $13,896K. Geographic revenues also decreased modestly in Japan, Singapore, and other regions. These trends suggest cautious growth prospects with stable cash generation but potential revenue pressures. The company’s strong liquidity and equity position support future financial stability, but the decline in revenues and unusual accounting items may impact growth trajectory. | The company’s future financial performance may be influenced by its significant investing cash outflow of $(21,230)K in 2023, indicating active investment in growth or asset acquisition. Financing cash outflow of $(10,114)K, including dividends of $(2,981)K, suggests a shareholder return policy balanced with debt reduction or other financing activities. The strong operational cash flow of $17,345K supports sustainability of these activities. Revenue concentration in Japan ($21,844K) and Singapore ($14,801K) with additional contributions from other regions ($10,721K) indicates geographic diversification that may support stable growth. The stable revenue in agency and logistics and slight growth in ship owning suggest moderate growth potential. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued financial stability with investments aimed at future expansion. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited operates primarily through two reportable segments: ship owning and agency and logistics. The ship owning segment involves owning a fleet of five Pure Car and Truck Carrier (PCTC) vessels with a total capacity of over 32,000 Car Equivalent Units (CEU), which are deployed on long-term charter contracts generating lease revenue recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Ancillary services under these charters, such as crew provision and other services, generate service income recognized over time. The agency and logistics segment provides shipping agency services, terminal operations, warehousing, and logistics services including freight, clearance, transportation, and handling of specialized cargoes. Revenue is generated from agency fees, terminal services, freight, clearance, transportation, labor, and warehouse operation charges recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. The Group also earns interest income and dividend income. Overall, revenue is generated through a combination of long-term vessel leasing (time charters), agency and logistics services, and ancillary service income. | The company operates primarily in the global transportation and maritime industry with a business model centered on long-term charters of vessels to top-rated charterers, which provides stable income and yield accretions on investments in vessels.

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks from volatile global trade conditions, including rising tariffs, shifting geopolitical alliances, and potential punitive fees on Chinese-built ships, which may disrupt global supply chains and reduce trade volumes. The agency and logistics business is exposed to changing trade landscapes and new trading routes, requiring agile adaptation. The Group's ship-owning segment relies on long-term charters with high-quality charterers, which provides resilience but remains sensitive to industry trends and customer behavior. The Group monitors economic and political conditions that could affect counterparties' ability to meet obligations, and manages concentration risks by maintaining a diversified portfolio to avoid excessive exposure to specific industries or regions. | The Group operates in the global transportation and maritime industry, which has faced crises such as US tariffs, COVID-19 disruptions, demand fluctuations, inflation, and congestion issues.
