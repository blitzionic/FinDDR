# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited's revenue showed a slight decline from 47,366 thousand USD in 2023 to 45,492 thousand USD in 2024, after a modest increase from 45,808 thousand USD in 2022 to 47,366 thousand USD in 2023. The gross margin in 2024 is reported at an unusually high 139.44%, which suggests possible data inconsistencies or extraordinary accounting treatments, as gross profit is 27,550 thousand USD against revenue of 45,492 thousand USD. Revenue by product/service indicates that ship owning remains the dominant segment, contributing 31,596 thousand USD in 2024, slightly down from 32,428 thousand USD in 2023, while agency and logistics revenue also declined from 14,938 thousand USD in 2023 to 13,896 thousand USD in 2024. Geographically, revenue from Japan decreased marginally from 21,844 thousand USD in 2023 to 21,485 thousand USD in 2024, Singapore revenue dropped from 14,801 thousand USD to 13,682 thousand USD, and revenue from other regions decreased from 10,721 thousand USD to 10,325 thousand USD, indicating a broad-based revenue contraction across regions and services in 2024 compared to 2023. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating efficiency. Operating income decreased from 10,478 thousand USD in 2023 to 8,046 thousand USD in 2024, while revenue also declined, but at a lesser rate, indicating rising operating expenses or cost pressures. Operating expenses in 2024 were 19,906 thousand USD, which, when compared to the gross profit of 27,550 thousand USD, suggests significant operating costs impacting profitability. The cost of goods sold in 2023 totaled 29,514 thousand USD (sum of -5,201, -8,372, -13,906, and -2,035), which is substantially higher than the 17,942 thousand USD reported in 2024, indicating a notable reduction in direct costs, yet this did not translate into improved operating margin, possibly due to increased operating expenses or other factors. Overall, the company appears to be facing challenges in controlling operating costs relative to revenue, leading to diminished operating profitability in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted from a positive 1% in 2023 to a negative 0.02% in 2024, indicating a negligible tax expense or potential tax benefits impacting net profitability. Income tax expense was minimal in both years, with -1 thousand USD in 2023 and -2 thousand USD in 2024, suggesting limited tax impact on earnings. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, implying that the observed profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance rather than one-off events or external shocks. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited demonstrated a stable and slightly improved financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased marginally from USD 187,278K to USD 189,104K, driven by a rise in current assets from USD 67,976K to USD 75,817K, despite a decrease in non-current assets from USD 119,302K to USD 113,287K. Total liabilities decreased from USD 69,467K to USD 65,781K, with reductions in both current liabilities (USD 12,570K to USD 11,744K) and non-current liabilities (USD 56,897K to USD 54,037K). Shareholders' equity grew from USD 117,811K to USD 123,323K, supported by an increase in retained earnings from USD 84,758K to USD 90,913K. The current ratio improved significantly from 540.78% to 645.58%, indicating enhanced liquidity and a strong ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio declined from 58.96% to 53.34%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained a solid financial health profile with improved liquidity and a stronger equity base in 2024. | In 2023, Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited demonstrated solid financial health with total assets increasing to USD 187,278 thousand from USD 178,844 thousand in 2022, reflecting asset growth of approximately 4.7%. Current assets rose significantly to USD 67,976 thousand, improving liquidity, while non-current assets slightly decreased to USD 119,302 thousand. Total liabilities decreased to USD 69,467 thousand from USD 72,941 thousand, indicating a reduction in leverage. Shareholders' equity increased to USD 117,811 thousand from USD 105,903 thousand, strengthening the capital base. The current ratio of 540.78% indicates a very strong liquidity position, suggesting the company can comfortably cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio improved to 58.96% from 68.88%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with reduced reliance on debt financing. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 showed a decline compared to 2023. Revenue decreased from USD 47,366K to USD 45,492K, with both main segments—ship owning and agency/logistics—experiencing lower revenues. Gross profit was reported at USD 27,550K in 2024, with a notably high gross margin of 139.44%, which is unusually elevated and may reflect accounting or classification specifics in cost of goods sold. Operating income declined from USD 10,478K to USD 8,046K, and net profit fell from USD 11,514K to USD 9,136K. Correspondingly, operating margin decreased from 22.12% to 17.69%, and net profit margin dropped from 24.31% to 20.08%. Return on equity and return on assets also declined, from 10.29% to 7.58% and 6.29% to 4.85%, respectively, indicating reduced earnings efficiency relative to equity and asset base. The effective tax rate remained negligible and slightly negative, suggesting minimal tax burden or tax credits. Interest expense decreased from USD 1,245K to USD 1,066K, but interest coverage ratio turned negative from a very high positive figure, indicating operating income was insufficient to cover interest expense in 2024. Overall, earnings quality weakened with lower profitability margins and returns, despite strong gross profit figures. | The company’s revenue increased modestly by 3.4% to USD 47,366 thousand in 2023 from USD 45,808 thousand in 2022, driven by ship owning revenue of USD 32,428 thousand and agency and logistics revenue of USD 14,938 thousand. Operating income was USD 10,478 thousand, yielding an operating margin of 22.12%, indicating efficient core operations. Net profit rose to USD 11,514 thousand, a 17.1% increase from USD 9,834 thousand in 2022, with a net profit margin improvement to 24.31% from 21.47%, reflecting enhanced earnings quality. Return on equity stood at 10.29% and return on assets at 6.29%, demonstrating effective use of equity and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate was exceptionally low at 0.01%, contributing to higher net profitability. Interest expense was USD 1,245 thousand, but interest coverage was very strong at 841.61%, indicating ample earnings to cover interest obligations. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2024. Cost of goods sold was consolidated at USD 17,942K, with no detailed breakdown for 2024, but gross profit remained strong. Operating expenses were significant at USD 19,906K, contributing to a reduced operating income. Asset turnover declined slightly from 25.87% to 24.17%, indicating a marginal decrease in revenue generated per unit of assets. Net cash from operations increased from USD 17,345K to USD 20,492K, reflecting improved cash generation from core business activities despite lower revenue. Inventories decreased slightly from USD 539K to USD 492K, suggesting tighter inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets grew and current liabilities decreased, supporting liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities reversed dramatically from an outflow of USD 21,230K in 2023 to an inflow of USD 40,253K in 2024, indicating significant asset disposals or divestments. Net cash from financing remained a cash outflow at USD 9,715K, slightly less than the previous year. Overall, operational cash flow strength improved, but asset utilization and cost control showed some pressure. | Cost of goods sold in 2023 totaled USD 29,514 thousand (sum of -5201, -8372, -13906, -2035), which when compared to revenue, suggests a gross margin that supports the operating margin of 22.12%. The asset turnover ratio was 25.87%, indicating high efficiency in generating revenue from assets. Net cash from operations decreased to USD 17,345 thousand from USD 20,028 thousand in 2022, signaling a slight decline in operational cash generation but still positive and substantial. Inventories were low at USD 539 thousand, indicating lean inventory management. The company maintained positive operating cash flow despite increased investing outflows, reflecting operational resilience. Working capital appears strong given the high current ratio and current assets of USD 67,976 thousand against current liabilities of USD 12,570 thousand. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 suggest moderate risk with some early warning signs. The debt to equity ratio improved to 53.34% from 58.96%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. The current ratio increased substantially to 645.58%, signaling strong liquidity and low short-term solvency risk. However, the interest coverage ratio turned negative (-754.78%) from a very high positive level, indicating that operating income was insufficient to cover interest expenses, which is a significant red flag for financial risk and sustainability of debt servicing. The effective tax rate remained negligible and slightly negative, which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets but also warrants monitoring for tax-related risks. The decline in profitability margins and returns on equity and assets further highlight potential earnings pressure. No significant changes in liabilities structure were noted, but the negative interest coverage ratio is a critical early warning sign requiring management attention. | The company’s leverage decreased as evidenced by a lower debt to equity ratio of 58.96% compared to 68.88% in 2022, reducing financial risk. Liquidity is robust with a current ratio of 540.78%, indicating minimal short-term liquidity risk. Interest coverage ratio is exceptionally high at 841.61%, showing the company’s strong ability to meet interest payments comfortably. The effective tax rate is negligible at 0.01%, which may warrant monitoring for sustainability or regulatory changes. The net cash from investing activities was significantly negative at USD (21,230) thousand, indicating heavy investment outflows that could increase risk if not matched by future returns. The net decrease in cash of USD (13,999) thousand and continued dividend payments of USD (2,981) thousand suggest cash outflows that require careful management to avoid liquidity strain. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company’s future financial performance may be influenced by its strong cash flow from operations and significant positive cash flow from investing activities in 2024, which contrasts with the prior year's heavy investing outflows. The large investing cash inflow of USD 40,253K suggests asset sales or divestitures, which could impact future revenue streams and operational capacity. Dividend payments increased slightly to USD 3,076K, indicating a stable dividend policy despite lower net profits. Revenue by geographic region remained relatively stable with slight declines in key markets such as Japan and Singapore, and the ship owning and agency/logistics segments both experienced revenue decreases, signaling potential challenges in core markets. The improved liquidity and reduced leverage provide a solid foundation for future investments or debt management. However, the negative interest coverage ratio and declining profitability margins suggest that the company needs to focus on improving earnings quality and operational efficiency to sustain cash flows and dividends. Overall, the company appears positioned for stable liquidity and capital structure but faces challenges in profitability and earnings sustainability that will shape future financial performance. | The substantial net cash outflow from investing activities (USD 21,230 thousand) in 2023 suggests the company is actively investing in growth or asset renewal, which may support future revenue and profit expansion. Despite this, net cash from operations remains strong at USD 17,345 thousand, indicating cash flow sustainability in the near term. Dividend payments increased slightly to USD 2,981 thousand, reflecting a stable or slightly more generous dividend policy, which may appeal to investors but requires balancing with investment needs. Revenue concentration in Japan (USD 21,844 thousand) and Singapore (USD 14,801 thousand) highlights key geographic markets that may influence future performance depending on regional economic conditions. The strong liquidity and reduced leverage position the company well to manage financial obligations and capitalize on growth opportunities. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued stable financial performance with potential growth driven by recent investments. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks from global trade fragmentation, rising tariffs, shifting geopolitical alliances, and policy threats such as potential punitive fees on Chinese-built ships, which could disrupt global supply chains. Demand volatility and changes in customer behavior are implied by the need to adapt agency and logistics services to new trading routes and reduced trade volumes. The Group's ship-owning segment relies on long-term charters with high-quality charterers, which provides resilience. The Group monitors industry trends and economic conditions, reflected in assumptions used for impairment testing and revenue growth projections. No specific mitigation measures beyond maintaining strong customer relationships and fleet competitiveness are detailed. | The Group faces market risks related to global transportation and maritime industry volatility, including impacts from geopolitical situations, economic downturns, and demand fluctuations. The business model of long-term charters to top-rated charterers mitigates exposure to market volatility, providing stable income and yield accretions. Revenue is concentrated with three major customers accounting for 62% of trade receivables, which could pose concentration risk. The Group monitors market changes and adjusts assumptions accordingly. Industry trends such as decarbonisation and shifts to Bio-LNG energy vessels are recognized as strategic considerations. |

| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The 2024 annual report highlights several economic challenges and uncertainties impacting Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited. The global trade environment is described as increasingly fragmented and uncertain, with rising tariffs, shifting geopolitical alliances, and potential punitive fees on Chinese-built ships posing risks to global supply chains. These factors could lead to deeper economic dislocation, especially given limited alternatives in new shipbuilding capacity. The Group faces cost pressures from inflation and operational expenses, including vessel operation costs and staff and crew costs. Foreign currency risk is significant due to transactional exposures primarily in Singapore Dollar, with sensitivity analyses indicating potential profit impacts from currency fluctuations. Liquidity risk is managed carefully to ensure sufficient funds under normal and stressed conditions. Interest rate risk is mitigated through interest rate swaps, but rising interest rates remain a concern. Credit risk is managed by trading with creditworthy parties, but economic uncertainties could affect borrowers' ability to meet obligations. The Group also monitors climate-related risks, including physical and transition risks, which increase uncertainty in estimates and assumptions. Overall, macroeconomic factors such as trade disruptions, inflation, currency volatility, and regulatory changes present ongoing challenges that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces economic challenges including inflation, demand fluctuations, and congestion issues persisting through 2024, which have impacted the global transportation and maritime industry.
