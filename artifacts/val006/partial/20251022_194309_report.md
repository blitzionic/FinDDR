# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited's revenue showed a slight decline from 47,366 thousand USD in 2023 to 45,492 thousand USD in 2024, after a small increase from 45,808 thousand USD in 2022 to 47,366 thousand USD in 2023. Gross margin improved marginally from 128.46% in 2023 to 130.23% in 2024, indicating strong profitability relative to direct costs despite the revenue dip. Revenue by product/service reveals that ship owning remains the dominant segment, contributing 31,596 thousand USD in 2024, slightly down from 32,428 thousand USD in 2023, while agency and logistics revenue also decreased from 14,938 thousand USD in 2023 to 13,896 thousand USD in 2024. Geographically, Japan is the largest market with 21,485 thousand USD in 2024, slightly down from 21,844 thousand USD in 2023, followed by Singapore and other regions, both showing minor declines, reflecting a consistent but slightly contracting revenue base across key regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 22.12% in 2023 to 17.69% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating efficiency. Operating income decreased from 10,478 thousand USD in 2023 to 8,046 thousand USD in 2024, while revenue also declined, but at a lesser rate, indicating rising operating expenses relative to revenue. Operating expenses fell from 23,309 thousand USD in 2023 to 21,906 thousand USD in 2024, showing some cost management efforts; however, the reduction in operating income suggests that cost savings were insufficient to offset the revenue decline. The operating income as a percentage of revenue dropped, signaling pressure on core operations and potential challenges in controlling indirect costs or maintaining operational leverage. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained negligible and slightly negative, at -0.01% in 2023 and -0.02% in 2024, indicating minimal tax expense impact on profitability and possibly reflecting tax credits or benefits. Income tax expense was almost zero, with (1) thousand USD in 2023 and (2) thousand USD in 2024, having an insignificant effect on net profit. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, suggesting that the profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance rather than one-off events or external shocks. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited demonstrated a stable and slightly improved financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased marginally from USD 187,278K to USD 189,104K, driven by a rise in current assets from USD 67,976K to USD 75,817K, despite a decline in non-current assets from USD 119,302K to USD 113,287K. Total liabilities decreased from USD 69,467K to USD 65,781K, with a notable reduction in non-current liabilities from USD 34,517K to USD 29,207K, although current liabilities rose slightly from USD 34,950K to USD 36,574K. Shareholders' equity strengthened from USD 117,811K to USD 123,323K, supported by an increase in retained earnings from USD 84,758K to USD 90,913K. Liquidity improved as reflected by the current ratio rising from 194.49% to 207.30%, indicating enhanced short-term financial flexibility. The debt to equity ratio declined from 58.96% to 53.34%, suggesting a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained solid financial health with increased equity base, improved liquidity, and lower leverage in 2024. | In 2023, Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited demonstrated solid financial health with total assets increasing to USD 187,278 thousand from USD 178,844 thousand in 2022, reflecting asset growth of approximately 4.7%. Current assets rose significantly by 25.4% to USD 67,976 thousand, enhancing liquidity. Non-current assets decreased slightly to USD 119,302 thousand, indicating possible asset disposals or depreciation. Total liabilities decreased by 4.8% to USD 69,467 thousand, driven by reductions in both current liabilities (up slightly by 5.5% to USD 34,950 thousand) and non-current liabilities (down 13.4% to USD 34,517 thousand). Shareholders' equity strengthened by 11.2% to USD 117,811 thousand, supported by retained earnings of USD 84,758 thousand. The current ratio improved from 163.79% to 194.49%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio declined from 68.88% to 58.96%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company’s balance sheet shows improved liquidity, reduced leverage, and stronger equity base in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability metrics for 2024 show a decline compared to 2023. Revenue decreased by approximately 4% from USD 47,366K to USD 45,492K, with both main segments—ship owning and agency/logistics—experiencing declines (ship owning down from USD 32,428K to USD 31,596K; agency and logistics down from USD 14,938K to USD 13,896K). Gross profit fell from USD 33,887K to USD 31,742K, but the gross margin slightly improved from 128.46% to 130.23%, indicating better cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. Operating income dropped significantly by 23% from USD 10,478K to USD 8,046K, with operating margin declining from 22.12% to 17.69%. Net profit decreased by 20.6% from USD 11,514K to USD 9,136K, and net profit margin contracted from 24.31% to 20.08%. Return on equity and return on assets also declined, from 10.29% to 7.58% and 6.29% to 4.85%, respectively, reflecting lower earnings efficiency relative to equity and assets. The effective tax rate remained negligible and slightly negative, indicating minimal tax burden. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2024 with lower absolute profits and margins despite a slight improvement in gross margin. | The company’s profitability improved in 2023 with revenue increasing modestly by 3.4% to USD 47,366 thousand from USD 45,808 thousand in 2022. Gross profit was USD 33,887 thousand, yielding an exceptionally high gross margin of 128.46%, which suggests significant non-standard accounting or revenue recognition factors, as cost of goods sold was negative at USD -13,479 thousand. Operating income stood at USD 10,478 thousand with an operating margin of 22.12%, indicating efficient control over operating expenses of USD 23,309 thousand. Net profit increased by 17.1% to USD 11,514 thousand, improving the net profit margin to 24.31% from 21.47% in 2022. Return on equity was 10.29% and return on assets was 6.29%, reflecting reasonable returns relative to equity and asset base. The effective tax rate was effectively zero (-0.01%), likely due to tax credits or adjustments, enhancing net profitability. Interest expense was USD 1,245 thousand, but interest coverage ratio was highly negative (-841.61%), which may indicate unusual accounting or timing effects. Overall, earnings quality appears strong with improved margins and profitability despite some unusual accounting figures. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 showed mixed results. Cost of goods sold increased slightly from USD 13,479K to USD 13,750K despite lower revenue, indicating some cost pressure. Operating expenses decreased from USD 23,309K to USD 21,906K, reflecting effective cost control efforts. Asset turnover declined from 25.87% to 24.17%, suggesting a slight reduction in asset utilization efficiency. Net cash from operations decreased by 13.4% from USD 20,028K to USD 17,345K, indicating lower cash generation from core business activities. Inventories reduced marginally from USD 539K to USD 492K, which may reflect tighter inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities rose slightly, with the current ratio improving to 207.30%. Overall, while cost control on operating expenses was effective, the company experienced reduced asset utilization and lower operational cash flow in 2024. | Operational efficiency in 2023 shows positive trends. The company generated net cash from operations of USD 20,028 thousand, indicating strong cash flow generation relative to net profit of USD 11,514 thousand, which suggests high earnings quality and effective working capital management. Asset turnover was very high at 25.87, implying exceptional utilization of assets to generate revenue, though this figure may be influenced by accounting treatments. Operating expenses were controlled at USD 23,309 thousand relative to revenue, supporting a healthy operating margin. Inventories were low at USD 539 thousand, indicating lean inventory management. Net cash from investing was positive at USD 140 thousand, suggesting limited investment outflows or asset disposals. Net cash from financing was USD 7,994 thousand, possibly reflecting new borrowings or equity inflows. Overall, the company demonstrates strong operational cash flow, efficient asset use, and controlled costs in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 suggest a moderate risk profile with some positive trends. Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio improved from 58.96% to 53.34%, reducing financial risk. Interest expense declined from USD 1,245K to USD 1,066K, and interest coverage ratio, though slightly reduced from 841.61% to 754.78%, remains very strong, indicating ample earnings to cover interest obligations. Liquidity improved with the current ratio increasing to 207.30%, enhancing short-term solvency. The effective tax rate remained negligible and slightly negative, indicating no significant tax risk. However, the decline in profitability and cash from operations could pose risks if trends continue. No other explicit risk factors such as sudden tax changes or large increases in liabilities were observed. Overall, the company maintains a low to moderate financial risk profile with strong interest coverage and improved leverage in 2024. | Financial risk indicators for 2023 show a relatively low leverage profile with debt to equity ratio at 58.96%, down from 68.88% in 2022, reducing financial risk. The current ratio improved to 194.49%, indicating strong liquidity to cover short-term obligations. However, the interest coverage ratio is reported as negative (-841.61%), which is unusual given positive operating income and may indicate timing differences or accounting anomalies in interest expense recognition. The effective tax rate is effectively zero (-0.01%), which may reflect tax planning or credits but could pose future tax risk if not sustainable. The slight increase in current liabilities to USD 34,950 thousand warrants monitoring for short-term liquidity needs. Overall, the company’s financial risk appears moderate with strong liquidity and reduced leverage, but the negative interest coverage and tax rate anomalies require further scrutiny. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited's future financial performance may be influenced by its significant investing and financing activities in 2024. Net cash from investing surged to USD 21,230K from a modest USD 140K in 2023, indicating substantial investment outflows which may be for asset acquisition or expansion, though non-current assets declined, suggesting possible asset disposals or reclassification. Net cash from financing increased to USD 10,114K from USD 7,994K, possibly reflecting new borrowings or equity financing to support investments. Dividends paid nearly tripled from USD 1,052K to USD 2,981K, signaling a more aggressive dividend policy that may impact cash reserves. Revenue by geographic region shows slight declines in key markets Japan and Singapore, which may require strategic focus. The sustainability of cash flows could be pressured by lower operational cash generation and higher investing outflows. The company’s improved liquidity and equity base provide a buffer, but careful management of investment returns and operational performance will be critical to support dividend payments and future growth. Segment-wise, ship owning remains the dominant revenue source, though slightly reduced, suggesting continued reliance on this core business. | Looking ahead, Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited’s future financial performance appears supported by strong operational cash flow of USD 20,028 thousand and positive net cash from investing activities, indicating potential asset optimization or limited capital expenditure. The company paid dividends of USD 1,052 thousand, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns while retaining substantial earnings (retained earnings at USD 84,758 thousand) to fund growth. Revenue concentration in ship owning (USD 32,428 thousand) and agency and logistics (USD 14,938 thousand) segments, with geographic revenue primarily from Japan (USD 21,844 thousand) and Singapore (USD 14,801 thousand), indicates stable core markets. The strong liquidity and reduced leverage provide financial flexibility for future investments or expansion. However, the unusual accounting figures in margins and interest coverage should be clarified to ensure sustainability. Overall, the company is well-positioned for continued stable performance with capacity for growth and shareholder returns in 2024. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks from global trade fragmentation and uncertainty, including rising tariffs, shifting geopolitical alliances, and potential punitive fees on Chinese-built ships, which could disrupt global supply chains and impact shipbuilding capacity. The agency and logistics business is challenged by reduced trade volumes and increased operational costs due to global uncertainty. The Group mitigates these risks by maintaining long-term charters with high-quality charterers, renewing time charters with blue-chip partners, and offering differentiated, agile logistics solutions to help clients realign supply chains and adapt to new trading routes. The Board monitors market and economic conditions as part of strategic planning. | The Group faces market risks related to global transportation and maritime industry volatility, including impacts from geopolitical situations, demand fluctuations, inflation, and supply chain disruptions. The business model of long-term charters to top-rated charterers mitigates demand volatility and economic downturn risks by providing stable income and yield accretions. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily from the Singapore Dollar, with transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases in currencies other than the functional currencies of Group entities. Management regularly reviews foreign currency exposure and uses foreign exchange options and forward exchange contracts to manage this risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that currency fluctuations can impact profit before tax. The Group also monitors industry trends such as shipping decarbonisation efforts and the shift towards Bio-LNG energy vessels, which present both risks and growth opportunities. Competition and customer behavior risks are indirectly addressed through maintaining relationships with credible and reputable charterers with good credit standing. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include challenges in business operations such as ship management, procurement, crew management, and compliance with ISO/ISM certifications and audits.
