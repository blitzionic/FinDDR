# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue for Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited decreased from USD 47,366 thousand in 2023 to USD 45,492 thousand in 2024, indicating a slight decline. Gross profit also declined from USD 33,887 thousand in 2023 to USD 30,750 thousand in 2024, with the gross margin dropping significantly from 128.46% in 2023 to 67.59% in 2024, suggesting a substantial change in cost structure or revenue recognition. Revenue by product/service shows that ship owning remains the dominant segment, contributing USD 31,596 thousand in 2024 compared to USD 32,428 thousand in 2023, while agency and logistics revenue decreased from USD 14,938 thousand in 2023 to USD 13,896 thousand in 2024. Geographically, revenue from Japan slightly decreased from USD 21,844 thousand in 2023 to USD 21,485 thousand in 2024, Singapore revenue declined from USD 14,801 thousand to USD 13,682 thousand, and revenue from other regions decreased from USD 10,721 thousand to USD 10,325 thousand, indicating a consistent but modest contraction across all regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income decreased from USD 10,478 thousand in 2023 to USD 8,046 thousand in 2024, with the operating margin declining from 22.12% to 17.69%, reflecting reduced operational profitability. Operating expenses increased in absolute terms from USD 20,344 thousand (noting the negative sign likely indicates a reporting format) in 2023 to USD 21,904 thousand in 2024, indicating higher cost pressures. The ratio of operating income to revenue fell, signaling less efficient cost management or increased operating costs relative to revenue. This trend suggests that despite a relatively stable revenue base, the company faced challenges in controlling operating expenses, which impacted overall operating efficiency negatively. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted from a negative rate of (0.01%) in 2023 to a positive 0.02% in 2024, indicating a minor increase in tax expense relative to income, though the impact on net profitability is minimal given the low rates. Income tax expense moved from a negative USD 1 thousand in 2023 to a positive USD 2 thousand in 2024, consistent with the effective tax rate change. There are no explicitly listed non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability in the provided financial data, suggesting that the observed profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited demonstrated a stable and slightly improved financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased marginally from USD 187,278K to USD 189,104K, driven by a rise in current assets from USD 67,976K to USD 75,817K, despite a decrease in non-current assets from USD 119,302K to USD 113,287K. Total liabilities decreased from USD 69,467K to USD 65,781K, with current liabilities remaining constant at USD 11,744K and non-current liabilities reducing from USD 57,723K to USD 54,037K. Shareholders' equity increased from USD 117,811K to USD 123,323K, supported by higher retained earnings rising from USD 84,758K to USD 90,913K. Liquidity improved as reflected by the current ratio increasing from 578.81% to 645.58%, indicating a stronger ability to cover short-term obligations. The capital structure showed a reduction in leverage with the debt to equity ratio declining from 58.96% to 53.34%, suggesting a more conservative financing approach and enhanced equity base. | In 2023, Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited demonstrated solid financial health with total assets increasing to USD 187,278 thousand from USD 178,844 thousand in 2022, indicating asset growth. Current assets rose significantly to USD 67,976 thousand, improving liquidity, while non-current assets slightly decreased to USD 119,302 thousand. Total liabilities decreased to USD 69,467 thousand from USD 72,941 thousand, reflecting a reduction in financial obligations. The current liabilities remained stable at USD 11,744 thousand. Shareholders' equity increased notably to USD 117,811 thousand from USD 105,903 thousand, supported by retained earnings of USD 84,758 thousand. The current ratio improved from 461.84% to 578.81%, indicating strong short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio declined from 68.88% to 58.96%, suggesting a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company’s balance sheet shows enhanced financial stability and a strong equity base in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability in 2024 declined compared to 2023. Revenue decreased from USD 47,366K to USD 45,492K, with both main segments—ship owning and agency/logistics—showing lower revenues. Gross profit fell from USD 33,887K to USD 30,750K, and gross margin sharply declined from 128.46% to 67.59%, indicating increased cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income dropped from USD 10,478K to USD 8,046K, with operating margin decreasing from 22.12% to 17.69%. Net profit also declined from USD 11,514K to USD 9,136K, and net profit margin reduced from 24.31% to 20.08%. Return on equity decreased from 10.29% to 7.58%, and return on assets declined from 6.29% to 4.85%, reflecting lower earnings efficiency relative to equity and assets. The effective tax rate shifted from a negligible negative (–0.01%) to a small positive 0.02%, having minimal impact on net profitability. Overall, earnings quality weakened with reduced margins and returns, signaling pressure on profitability despite stable revenue streams. | The company reported total revenue of USD 47,366 thousand in 2023, with no prior year data for direct comparison. Gross profit was USD 33,887 thousand, yielding an exceptionally high gross margin of 128.46%, which is unusual and may reflect accounting or classification specifics but indicates strong profitability at the gross level. Operating income stood at USD 10,478 thousand with an operating margin of 22.12%, demonstrating effective control over operating expenses of USD 20,344 thousand. Net profit was USD 11,514 thousand, resulting in a net profit margin of 24.31%, indicating high earnings quality. The effective tax rate was nearly zero at -0.01%, suggesting minimal tax expense. Return on equity was 10.29% and return on assets was 6.29%, reflecting reasonable returns relative to equity and asset base. Interest expense was USD 1,245 thousand, with an extremely high interest coverage ratio of 841.61%, indicating strong ability to meet interest obligations. Overall, profitability and earnings quality in 2023 were robust with strong margins and returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed signs of deterioration in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased from USD 13,479K (noting the 2023 figure was negative, likely a data anomaly) to USD 14,742K, contributing to a lower gross margin. Operating expenses increased from USD 20,344K to USD 21,904K, indicating less effective cost control. Asset turnover slightly declined from 25.87% to 24.17%, suggesting marginally less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased from USD 20,028K to USD 17,345K, reflecting reduced cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased slightly from USD 539K to USD 492K, which may indicate tighter inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets increased while current liabilities remained flat, supporting liquidity. However, the decline in operating cash flow and margins points to challenges in operational efficiency and cost management. | Operational efficiency in 2023 is highlighted by a high asset turnover ratio of 25.87, indicating very efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Cost control appears effective with cost of goods sold at USD 13,479 thousand and operating expenses at USD 20,344 thousand, supporting strong gross and operating margins. Net cash from operations was USD 20,028 thousand, which is positive and exceeds net profit, indicating good cash generation from core operations. Inventories were low at USD 539 thousand, suggesting efficient inventory management. The company’s working capital position is strong, supported by a current ratio of 578.81%. Cash flow from investing was positive at USD 140 thousand, and financing cash flow was USD 7,994 thousand, contributing to a net increase in cash of USD 12,174 thousand. These factors collectively indicate strong operational efficiency and healthy cash flow management in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 suggest moderate risk with some positive trends. Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio fell from 58.96% to 53.34%, reducing financial risk exposure. Interest expense decreased from USD 1,245K to USD 1,066K, and interest coverage ratio, while very high in both years, declined from 841.61% to 754.78%, still indicating strong ability to cover interest obligations comfortably. Liquidity improved with the current ratio rising from 578.81% to 645.58%, signaling robust short-term financial health. The effective tax rate moved from a negligible negative to a small positive, unlikely to materially affect risk. No significant changes in current liabilities or unusual financing costs were observed. Overall, the company maintains a low financial risk profile with strong liquidity and manageable leverage, though slight declines in interest coverage warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators for 2023 show a conservative leverage profile with a debt to equity ratio of 58.96%, down from 68.88% in 2022, reducing financial risk. The current ratio of 578.81% indicates excellent liquidity, minimizing short-term solvency risk. Interest coverage ratio is extremely high at 841.61%, reflecting very low risk of default on interest payments despite interest expense of USD 1,245 thousand. The effective tax rate is negligible at -0.01%, which may indicate tax planning benefits or credits but should be monitored for sustainability. No significant increases in liabilities or current liabilities were observed. Overall, the company exhibits low financial risk with strong liquidity and manageable leverage in 2023, though the unusual tax rate and very high margins warrant ongoing review. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Singapore Shipping Corporation Limited's future financial performance may be influenced by its significant investing and financing activities in 2024. Net cash from investing surged to USD 21,230K from USD 140K in 2023, indicating substantial investment outflows which could be for asset acquisition or expansion, though non-current assets decreased, suggesting possible asset disposals or reclassifications. Net cash from financing increased to USD 10,114K from USD 7,994K, supporting these investments and possibly dividend payments. Dividends paid nearly tripled from USD 1,052K to USD 2,981K, reflecting a more generous dividend policy that may impact cash reserves. Revenue by product and geography showed slight declines, with ship owning and agency/logistics revenues down, and geographic revenues in Japan, Singapore, and others also reduced, signaling potential market challenges. The sustainability of cash flows may be pressured by lower operating cash and higher investing outflows, but strong liquidity and equity position provide a buffer. The company should monitor operational performance and market conditions closely to sustain growth and profitability. | The company’s future financial performance appears promising based on 2023 data. Positive net cash from operations of USD 20,028 thousand and a net increase in cash of USD 12,174 thousand indicate sustainable cash flow generation. Net cash from investing was slightly positive at USD 140 thousand, suggesting limited but positive investment activity. Financing cash flow was USD 7,994 thousand, which alongside dividends paid of USD 1,052 thousand, indicates a balanced approach to capital management and shareholder returns. Revenue segmentation shows strong contributions from ship owning (USD 32,428 thousand) and agency and logistics (USD 14,938 thousand), with geographic revenue concentrated in Japan (USD 21,844 thousand) and Singapore (USD 14,801 thousand), suggesting focused market presence. The strong equity base and cash flow position support potential for continued investment and dividend payments. Overall, the company is well-positioned for stable future performance with sustainable cash flows and targeted market segments. |
