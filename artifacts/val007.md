# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | United Plantations Berhad's revenue declined from RM2,514,808,000 in 2022 to RM2,014,248,000 in 2023, then partially recovered to RM2,197,810,000 in 2024. Despite this revenue volatility, gross profit remained relatively stable, with RM1,554,550,000 in 2022, RM1,433,659,000 in 2023, and RM1,455,177,000 in 2024. The gross margin showed a significant improvement from 61.82% in 2022 to 128.82% in 2023 and further to 133.79% in 2024, indicating better cost control or pricing power. Revenue by product shows a shift with palm oil refining revenue decreasing from RM1,809,493,000 in 2022 to RM1,312,625,000 in 2023, then rising to RM1,468,068,000 in 2024, while plantation revenue remained relatively stable around RM700 million. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia decreased from RM1,273,342,000 in 2022 to RM1,017,147,000 in 2023 but increased to RM1,054,118,000 in 2024. Revenue from Europe and the United States dropped sharply by 2024, while 'Others' region revenue increased significantly to RM883,581,000 in 2024 from RM688,125,000 in 2022, suggesting a geographic revenue shift towards other markets. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from RM823,903,000 in 2022 to RM897,202,000 in 2023 but slightly declined to RM893,049,000 in 2024, despite the revenue fluctuations. Operating margin improved from 32.76% in 2022 to 44.54% in 2023 but decreased to 40.63% in 2024, reflecting some pressure on operating efficiency in the latest year. Operating expenses decreased from RM797,203,000 in 2022 to RM536,457,000 in 2023 and then increased to RM562,128,000 in 2024, indicating effective cost management in 2023 with a slight relaxation in 2024. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved significantly from 32.76% in 2022 to over 40% in subsequent years, demonstrating enhanced operational leverage and cost control despite revenue volatility. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 28.46% in 2022 to approximately 23.83% in 2023 and 23.38% in 2024, which positively impacted net profitability by reducing tax expenses relative to pre-tax income. Income tax expense figures show a reduction from RM240,921,000 in 2022 to RM222,473,000 in 2023 and RM219,468,000 in 2024, consistent with the lower tax rates. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, suggesting that the profitability trends are primarily driven by operational and tax factors rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, United Plantations Berhad's total assets slightly decreased to RM3,243,244 thousand from RM3,263,605 thousand in 2023, reflecting a marginal contraction in asset base. Non-current assets increased modestly to RM2,109,580 thousand, indicating ongoing investment in long-term assets, while current assets declined to RM1,133,664 thousand, suggesting a reduction in liquidity buffers. Total liabilities rose to RM426,015 thousand from RM396,185 thousand, driven primarily by an increase in current liabilities to RM222,199 thousand, partially offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities to RM203,816 thousand. Shareholders' equity decreased to RM2,799,779 thousand from RM2,850,440 thousand, reflecting the net effect of retained earnings growth and other equity movements. The current ratio declined from 634.89% to 510.20%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity but still a very strong liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio increased from 13.90% to 15.22%, showing a slight increase in leverage but remaining low, suggesting a conservative capital structure. Overall, the company maintains a strong financial health profile with solid equity base, manageable liabilities, and robust liquidity despite slight declines in some asset and equity components. | In 2023, United Plantations Berhad's total assets slightly decreased to RM3,263,605 thousand from RM3,318,800 thousand in 2022, indicating a marginal contraction in asset base. Current assets also declined to RM1,185,950 thousand from RM1,246,408 thousand, while non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities decreased to RM396,185 thousand from RM414,039 thousand, driven by a reduction in current liabilities to RM186,796 thousand, partially offset by a slight increase in non-current liabilities to RM209,389 thousand. Shareholders' equity decreased slightly to RM2,850,440 thousand from RM2,890,733 thousand, reflecting retained earnings decline. The current ratio improved from 596.03% to 634.89%, indicating enhanced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 13.90% from 14.32%, suggesting a marginally stronger capital structure with low leverage. Overall, the company maintains a strong financial position with solid equity base, good liquidity, and low leverage in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 9.1% to RM2,197,810 thousand in 2024 from RM2,014,248 thousand in 2023, driven by growth in both plantations and palm oil refining segments. Gross profit improved slightly to RM1,455,177 thousand from RM1,433,659 thousand, supported by a higher gross margin of 133.79% compared to 128.82% in 2023, indicating improved cost efficiency or pricing power relative to cost of goods sold. However, operating income slightly decreased to RM893,049 thousand from RM897,202 thousand, causing the operating margin to decline from 44.54% to 40.63%, reflecting increased operating expenses. Net profit rose modestly to RM719,409 thousand from RM711,021 thousand, but net profit margin decreased to 32.73% from 35.30%, indicating some margin pressure despite higher absolute profits. Return on equity improved to 25.46% from 24.77%, and return on assets increased to 22.11% from 21.60%, both signaling enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 23.38% from 23.83%, contributing to net profitability. Overall, profitability shows growth in revenue and net profit with improved returns, though margin compression at operating and net levels suggests cost or pricing challenges. | Revenue declined by approximately 19.9% to RM2,014,248 thousand in 2023 from RM2,514,808 thousand in 2022, primarily due to lower palm oil refining revenue (RM1,312,625 thousand vs RM1,809,493 thousand) and reduced sales in key geographic regions such as Malaysia and Europe. Despite the revenue decline, gross profit remained robust at RM1,433,659 thousand, only a 7.8% decrease from 2022, supported by a reported negative cost of goods sold figure (-RM580,589 thousand) which may indicate accounting adjustments or reclassifications. Gross margin surged to 128.82% from 61.82%, reflecting improved earnings quality or unusual cost recognition. Operating income increased to RM897,202 thousand from RM823,903 thousand, lifting operating margin to 44.54% from 32.76%. Net profit rose by 17.4% to RM711,021 thousand, with net profit margin improving to 35.30% from 24.08%. Return on equity and assets were strong at 24.77% and 21.60% respectively, indicating efficient use of capital and assets to generate earnings. The effective tax rate was negative at (23.83%) compared to 28.46% in 2022, suggesting tax benefits or credits impacting net profitability. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved significantly in 2023 despite lower revenue. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 shows mixed trends. Cost of goods sold increased significantly to RM742,633 thousand from RM580,589 thousand, reflecting higher input costs or volume, yet gross margin improved, indicating revenue growth outpaced cost increases. Operating expenses rose moderately to RM562,128 thousand from RM536,457 thousand, contributing to a slight decline in operating income. Asset turnover improved notably to 67.55% from 61.20%, demonstrating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories decreased to RM228,485 thousand from RM245,938 thousand, suggesting improved inventory management. Net cash from operations remained stable at RM688,582 thousand compared to RM690,795 thousand, indicating consistent cash generation from core activities. Working capital dynamics show a decrease in current assets and increase in current liabilities, which may tighten operational liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities turned negative at RM(112,042) thousand from a positive RM112,865 thousand, indicating increased investment outflows. Financing cash outflows decreased to RM(712,294) thousand from RM(762,589) thousand, reflecting lower financing activities. Overall, the company demonstrates solid asset utilization and stable operational cash flow, though increased investing outflows and tighter working capital warrant monitoring. | Operating expenses were reported as negative (-RM536,457 thousand) in 2023 compared to RM797,203 thousand in 2022, which may reflect accounting reclassifications or cost recoveries, contributing to improved operating income. Asset turnover was high at 61.20, indicating very efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories increased modestly to RM245,938 thousand from RM219,549 thousand, which may reflect inventory buildup or changes in working capital management. Net cash from operations declined to RM690,795 thousand from RM929,129 thousand, indicating reduced cash generation from core operations. Despite this, the company maintained positive operating cash flow. Working capital remains strong given the high current ratio and manageable current liabilities. Cash flow from investing activities turned positive to RM112,865 thousand from a negative RM190,402 thousand, suggesting asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. Financing cash outflows increased to RM(762,589) thousand from RM(496,591) thousand, driven by higher dividend payments (RM746,613 thousand vs RM518,481 thousand). Overall, operational efficiency appears strong with high asset turnover and controlled costs, though cash from operations declined. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 suggest a low but slightly elevated risk profile compared to 2023. The debt to equity ratio increased to 15.22% from 13.90%, indicating a modest rise in leverage but still a conservative level. The current ratio declined to 510.20% from 634.89%, reflecting reduced short-term liquidity but remaining very strong. Interest expense increased slightly to RM847 thousand from RM747 thousand, yet interest coverage remains extremely high at 105,436.72%, down from 120,107.36%, indicating ample earnings to cover interest obligations and minimal default risk. The effective tax rate decreased marginally, showing stable tax expense management. The net increase in cash was negative RM(135,754) thousand compared to a positive RM41,071 thousand in 2023, which may signal cash flow timing or investment pressures. No significant changes in non-current liabilities or other risk factors are evident. Overall, financial risk remains low with strong liquidity and coverage ratios, though the slight increase in leverage and negative cash flow change warrant attention. | Leverage remains low with a debt to equity ratio of 13.90%, slightly improved from 14.32% in 2022, indicating limited financial risk from debt. Liquidity is strong with a current ratio of 634.89%, up from 596.03%, suggesting ample short-term asset coverage of liabilities. Interest expense is negative (-RM747 thousand) compared to RM2,312 thousand in 2022, and interest coverage ratio is negative (-120,107.36%), which may indicate interest income or accounting anomalies rather than risk from interest burden. The effective tax rate turned negative at (23.83%) from 28.46%, which could signal tax credits or deferred tax assets but also warrants monitoring for sustainability. No significant increase in liabilities or cash flow stress is evident. However, the unusual negative figures in cost of goods sold, operating expenses, interest expense, and tax expense suggest potential accounting irregularities or one-off items that should be investigated as early warning signals. Overall, financial risk appears low but with some unusual accounting items requiring attention. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, United Plantations Berhad's future financial performance appears cautiously optimistic. The company increased investment in non-current assets as indicated by the rise to RM2,109,580 thousand, and the negative net cash from investing activities of RM(112,042) thousand suggests ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support growth. Stable net cash from operations at RM688,582 thousand and a consistent dividend payout of RM705,135 thousand indicate sustainable cash flow and a shareholder-friendly dividend policy. Revenue growth in key segments—plantations and palm oil refining—continued, with geographic expansion evidenced by increased revenue in Europe and the United States, suggesting diversification and market development. However, the decline in cash reserves and tighter working capital may require careful liquidity management. Given the strong profitability metrics and asset utilization, the company is well-positioned for continued growth, provided it manages investment outflows and maintains operational efficiency. | Net cash from investing activities improved to a positive RM112,865 thousand in 2023 from a negative RM190,402 thousand in 2022, indicating possible asset sales or reduced capital expenditure, which may limit future growth but improve short-term cash flow. Net cash from financing activities outflow increased to RM(762,589) thousand, driven by higher dividend payments, reflecting a shareholder-friendly dividend policy but potentially reducing retained capital for reinvestment. Revenue by segment shows a decline in palm oil refining revenue and a slight decrease in plantation revenue, while other segments remain unreported, suggesting potential challenges in core business areas. Geographic revenue shows a significant drop in Europe and Malaysia but an increase in the United States and others, indicating shifting market dynamics. The strong cash flow from operations, despite being lower than prior year, combined with positive investing cash flow and high dividend payout, suggests cash flow sustainability but limited reinvestment capacity. Future performance may depend on managing revenue declines in key segments and regions and balancing dividend policy with investment needs. The company’s strong equity base and low leverage provide financial flexibility for future opportunities. |

UniFuji, inaugurated in 2018, is the first refinery globally to operate completely fossil fuel-free using renewable energy from biomass waste and offers full traceability from seed to finished fractions. The company focuses on product innovations that meet the highest food safety and quality requirements, including producing palm oil fractions with the lowest levels of food contaminants such as 3-MCPD, GE, and MOSH/MOAH, catering especially to sensitive applications like infant formula. Unitata plans to expand sales and marketing capabilities in 2024 to explore further opportunities for marketing specialty fats directly through B2B arrangements globally. |
