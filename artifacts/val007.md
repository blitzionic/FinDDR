# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2023 to 2024, revenue increased from RM 2,014,248 thousand to RM 2,197,810 thousand, representing a growth of approximately 9.1%. Gross margin improved slightly from 130.91% in 2023 to 133.79% in 2024, indicating enhanced profitability on direct costs despite the absolute Cost of Goods Sold rising from RM 622,547 thousand to RM 742,633 thousand. Revenue by product shows that Plantations revenue increased modestly by 4.1% from RM 701,623 thousand in 2023 to RM 729,742 thousand in 2024, while Palm oil refining revenue grew by 11.8% from RM 1,312,625 thousand to RM 1,468,068 thousand, recovering from a significant drop in 2023 compared to 2022. Geographically, Malaysia remains the dominant market with revenue rising 3.7% to RM 1,054,118 thousand in 2024. Indonesia revenue slightly declined by 2.1% to RM 209,281 thousand. Europe and United States revenues increased notably, with Europe growing 30% to RM 34,973 thousand and the US increasing over 12-fold to RM 15,857 thousand, though still small in absolute terms. The 'Others' category saw a substantial 17% increase to RM 883,581 thousand, indicating diversification or growth in other markets. Overall, revenue growth is driven primarily by Palm oil refining and expansion in diverse geographic markets, supported by improved gross margins despite rising direct costs. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 44.54% in 2023 to 40.63% in 2024, reflecting a decrease in operating efficiency. Operating income slightly decreased from RM 897,202 thousand in 2023 to RM 893,049 thousand in 2024, despite the revenue increase, indicating that operating expenses grew disproportionately. Operating expenses rose by 5.3% from RM 582,381 thousand to RM 613,228 thousand, outpacing revenue growth of 9.1% but still contributing to margin compression. The operating income to revenue ratio confirms this trend, with operating income nearly flat while revenue increased, suggesting cost management challenges or increased investment in operations. Nonetheless, the company maintains a strong operating margin above 40%, indicating robust operational profitability, but the downward trend signals a need for tighter cost control to sustain margin levels. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from 23.83% in 2023 to 23.38% in 2024, which marginally improved net profitability. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the data provided. External factors impacting profitability include geographic revenue shifts, with increased sales in Europe, the US, and other regions potentially reflecting market expansion or changing demand patterns. The significant increase in US revenue, although from a low base, may indicate new market penetration. The stable tax rate and absence of one-off items suggest that profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance and market dynamics rather than extraordinary events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company’s total assets slightly decreased to RM 3,243,244 thousand from RM 3,263,605 thousand in 2023, indicating a marginal contraction in asset base. Non-current assets increased modestly to RM 2,109,580 thousand, while current assets declined to RM 1,133,664 thousand, reflecting a shift towards longer-term asset holdings.

The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 23.38% from 23.83%, contributing to net income stability. Overall, profitability remains robust with strong returns, though margin compression at operating and net levels warrants monitoring. | The company reported revenue of RM 2,014,248 thousand in 2023, with no comparable 2022 revenue data available. Cost of goods sold was RM 622,547 thousand, resulting in an exceptionally high gross margin of 130.91%, which is unusual and may indicate significant non-standard accounting or revenue recognition factors. Operating expenses were RM 582,381 thousand, yielding an operating income of RM 897,202 thousand and an operating margin of 44.54%, reflecting strong operational profitability. Net profit increased from RM 605,564 thousand in 2022 to RM 711,021 thousand in 2023, a significant improvement. Net profit margin stood at 35.30%, indicating efficient cost control and earnings quality. Return on equity was 24.77% and return on assets was 21.60%, both indicating robust returns and sustainable earnings generation. The effective tax rate was negative at (23.83%), which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax benefits enhancing net profitability. Overall, profitability and earnings quality in 2023 are strong and improved compared to 2022. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased moderately by 5.3% to RM 613,228 thousand, while revenue grew by 9.1%, indicating some control over cost growth but with a slight impact on operating margin. Asset turnover improved significantly to 67.55% from 61.20%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations remained stable at RM 688,582 thousand compared to RM 690,795 thousand in 2023, showing consistent cash generation capacity. Inventories decreased to RM 228,485 thousand from RM 245,938 thousand, suggesting improved inventory management. The current ratio declined but remains strong, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, the company demonstrates solid operational efficiency with improved asset utilization and stable operating cash flows, though operating margin contraction indicates some cost pressures. | Operational efficiency in 2023 is highlighted by a high operating margin of 44.54%, indicating effective cost control relative to revenue. The asset turnover ratio of 61.20% suggests moderate utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased from RM 929,129 thousand in 2022 to RM 690,795 thousand in 2023, indicating a reduction in cash generation from core business activities, which may warrant monitoring. Inventories increased from RM 219,549 thousand to RM 245,938 thousand, which could impact working capital management. The current ratio improved to 634.89%, reflecting strong short-term liquidity. Overall, the company demonstrates good operational efficiency with strong margins but a decline in operating cash flow that should be addressed. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased slightly as debt to equity rose to 15.22% from 13.90%, driven by higher total liabilities. Interest expense increased marginally to RM 847 thousand from RM 747 thousand, but interest coverage remains extremely high at 105,436.72%, down from 120,107.36%, indicating negligible risk from interest obligations. The current ratio decreased to 510.20% from 634.89%, signaling reduced but still very strong liquidity. The effective tax rate remained stable, minimizing tax-related risk. The slight increase in current liabilities and decrease in current assets may warrant monitoring for short-term liquidity risk, but overall financial risk remains low given strong coverage ratios and conservative leverage. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a conservative leverage profile with a debt to equity ratio of 13.90%, slightly improved from 14.32% in 2022, indicating low financial risk from debt. Interest expense is minimal at RM 747 thousand, and the interest coverage ratio is extremely high at (120,107.36%), suggesting negligible risk in meeting interest obligations. The effective tax rate is negative at (23.83%), which may indicate tax benefits but also introduces some uncertainty in tax expense predictability. Liquidity is strong with a current ratio of 634.89%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. However, the decline in net cash from operations and increased dividends paid (RM 746,613 thousand in 2023 vs RM 518,481 thousand in 2022) could pressure cash reserves. Overall, financial risk remains low but cash flow trends and tax rate anomalies should be monitored. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities shifted from a positive net cash inflow of RM 112,865 thousand in 2023 to a net outflow of RM 112,042 thousand in 2024, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities improved slightly, with outflows decreasing to RM 712,294 thousand from RM 762,589 thousand, reflecting continued debt repayment or dividend payments. Dividends paid decreased to RM 705,135 thousand from RM 746,613 thousand, suggesting a modest easing in cash distribution to shareholders. Revenue growth was supported by increases in key segments: plantations revenue rose to £729,742 thousand from £701,623 thousand, and palm oil refining increased to £1,468,068 thousand from £1,312,625 thousand. Geographic revenue growth was notable in Malaysia and Europe, with Malaysia increasing to £1,054,118 thousand and Europe to £34,973 thousand, while the United States segment grew significantly from £1,200 thousand to £15,857 thousand. These trends indicate positive growth prospects supported by investment and expanding market presence. Cash flow sustainability appears stable with strong operational cash generation, though the negative net cash from investing suggests ongoing investment in growth initiatives. | Investment activities in 2023 show a positive net cash from investing of RM 112,865 thousand compared to a negative outflow in 2022, indicating possible asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities was a significant outflow of RM 762,589 thousand, higher than 2022, driven by increased dividend payments of RM 746,613 thousand, suggesting a shareholder-friendly dividend policy but potential pressure on cash reserves. Revenue by geographic region shows a decline in Malaysia and Europe but a notable increase in the United States and Others segment, indicating shifting market dynamics and potential growth opportunities in these regions. Revenue by product shows a decrease in palm oil refining revenue and a slight decrease in plantations revenue, which may impact future growth. Overall, the company appears to be focusing on returning capital to shareholders while cautiously managing investments, with geographic revenue shifts that may influence future performance. |
