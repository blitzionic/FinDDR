# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from RM 2,514,808 thousand in 2022 to RM 2,014,248 thousand in 2023, a decrease of approximately 19.93%, before rebounding to RM 2,197,810 thousand in 2024, a 9.11% increase from 2023 but still 12.62% below 2022 levels. Gross profit followed a similar pattern, decreasing from RM 1,554,550 thousand in 2022 to RM 1,381,701 thousand in 2023 (-11.13%), then rising to RM 1,486,189 thousand in 2024 (+7.54% from 2023). Notably, the gross margin more than doubled from 61.82% in 2022 to 130.91% in 2023 and further to 132.38% in 2024, indicating a significant improvement in cost of goods sold management or possible accounting adjustments, as the 2022 cost of goods sold figure appears inconsistent (positive RM 960,258 thousand) compared to negative values in other years. Revenue by product/service shows that palm oil refining revenue decreased sharply from RM 1,809,493 thousand in 2022 to RM 1,312,625 thousand in 2023 (-27.44%) but partially recovered to RM 1,468,068 thousand in 2024 (+11.82%). Plantation revenue remained relatively stable, with a slight dip from RM 705,315 thousand in 2022 to RM 701,623 thousand in 2023 (-0.52%) and a modest increase to RM 729,742 thousand in 2024 (+4.07%). Geographically, Malaysia remains the largest market but revenue declined from RM 1,273,342 thousand in 2022 to RM 1,017,147 thousand in 2023 (-20.13%) before increasing to RM 1,054,118 thousand in 2024 (+3.68%). Indonesia revenue decreased steadily from RM 228,472 thousand in 2022 to RM 213,687 thousand in 2023 (-6.47%) and RM 209,281 thousand in 2024 (-2.08%). Europe and United States revenues saw significant declines from 2022 to 2023, with Europe dropping from RM 324,463 thousand to RM 26,887 thousand (-91.71%) and the US from RM 406 thousand to RM 1,200 thousand (+195.57%, but still very low), with Europe slightly recovering to RM 34,973 thousand in 2024 (+30.06%) and the US increasing to RM 15,857 thousand (+1221.42%). The 'Others' category grew steadily from RM 688,125 thousand in 2022 to RM 755,327 thousand in 2023 (+9.75%) and RM 883,581 thousand in 2024 (+16.97%). Overall, revenue contraction in 2023 was driven mainly by palm oil refining and key geographic markets like Malaysia and Europe, with partial recovery in 2024 and growth in other regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from RM 823,903 thousand in 2022 to RM 897,202 thousand in 2023 (+8.87%) and slightly decreased to RM 893,049 thousand in 2024 (-0.46%). Despite revenue declining in 2023, operating income improved, indicating enhanced operating efficiency or cost control. Operating margin rose from 32.76% in 2022 to 44.54% in 2023, then declined to 40.63% in 2024, reflecting a peak in operational profitability in 2023. Operating expenses decreased from RM 797,203 thousand in 2022 to RM 584,499 thousand in 2023 (-26.68%) and remained stable at RM 593,528 thousand in 2024 (+1.54%), demonstrating effective cost management contributing to improved operating margins. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that despite a 19.93% revenue drop in 2023, operating income grew by 8.87%, highlighting strong operational leverage and expense control. However, the slight decline in operating income and margin in 2024 despite revenue growth suggests some pressure on operating efficiency or increased costs. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate improved significantly from a positive 28.46% in 2022 to negative rates of (23.83%) in 2023 and (23.38%) in 2024, indicating tax benefits or credits that increased net profitability. Income tax expense figures show a shift from a positive RM 240,921 thousand in 2022 to negative RM 222,473 thousand in 2023 and RM 219,468 thousand in 2024, consistent with the effective tax rate trend. This tax benefit likely contributed to the increase in net profit margin from 24.08% in 2022 to 35.30% in 2023 and 32.73% in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data, but the large swings in gross margin and tax rates suggest possible one-off accounting adjustments or tax-related events. External factors such as significant revenue declines in key geographic markets (Europe and Malaysia) and product segments (palm oil refining) in 2023, followed by partial recovery in 2024, likely impacted profitability dynamics. The tax benefits and cost management appear to have mitigated the negative impact of these external challenges. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company maintained a strong financial position with total assets slightly decreasing from RM 3,263,605 thousand in 2023 to RM 3,243,244 thousand. Non-current assets grew modestly by RM 32,925 thousand, indicating ongoing investment in long-term assets, while current assets declined by RM 52,286 thousand, reflecting a reduction in liquidity buffers. Total liabilities increased from RM 396,185 thousand to RM 426,015 thousand, driven primarily by a rise in current liabilities (from RM 186,796 thousand to RM 222,199 thousand), while non-current liabilities slightly decreased. Shareholders' equity decreased by RM 50,661 thousand to RM 2,799,779 thousand, partly due to dividend payouts and net profit retention. The current ratio declined from 634.89% to 510.20%, indicating reduced short-term liquidity but still a very strong liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio increased from 13.90% to 15.22%, showing a slight increase in leverage but still low overall. Overall, the balance sheet remains robust with strong equity and manageable liabilities, though liquidity and leverage trends suggest cautious monitoring is warranted. | In 2023, the company maintained a strong financial position with total assets slightly decreasing from RM 3,318,800 thousand in 2022 to RM 3,263,605 thousand, indicating a marginal contraction of about 1.7%. Current assets also declined from RM 1,246,408 thousand to RM 1,185,950 thousand, while non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities decreased from RM 414,039 thousand to RM 396,185 thousand, reflecting effective liability management and a slight reduction in financial obligations. Current liabilities dropped from RM 209,117 thousand to RM 186,796 thousand, though non-current liabilities increased slightly. Shareholders' equity decreased modestly from RM 2,890,733 thousand to RM 2,850,440 thousand, consistent with the retained earnings decline. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio rising from 596.03% to 634.89%, indicating enhanced short-term financial stability. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved from 14.32% to 13.90%, suggesting a conservative capital structure with low leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a solid financial foundation with prudent asset and liability management and strong liquidity in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 9.1% from RM 2,014,248 thousand in 2023 to RM 2,197,810 thousand in 2024, driven by growth in both plantations and palm oil refining segments. Gross profit rose by 7.5% to RM 1,486,189 thousand, improving the gross margin slightly from 130.91% to 132.38%, indicating effective cost of goods sold management relative to revenue. However, operating income slightly declined by 0.46% to RM 893,049 thousand, causing the operating margin to fall from 44.54% to 40.63%, reflecting increased operating expenses. Net profit increased marginally by 1.16% to RM 719,409 thousand, but net profit margin decreased from 35.30% to 32.73%, suggesting some pressure on bottom-line profitability despite higher revenues. Return on equity improved from 24.77% to 25.46%, and return on assets increased from 21.60% to 22.11%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 23.38%, supporting net profitability. Overall, profitability remains strong with sustainable earnings, though margin compression at operating and net levels warrants attention. | The company experienced a decline in revenue from RM 2,514,808 thousand in 2022 to RM 2,014,248 thousand in 2023, a decrease of approximately 19.9%. Despite this, gross profit remained robust at RM 1,381,701 thousand, down from RM 1,554,550 thousand but still strong. Notably, the cost of goods sold figure for 2023 is negative (RM -622,547 thousand), which is unusual and may indicate accounting adjustments or reversals; however, gross margin improved significantly to 130.91% from 61.82% in 2022, suggesting exceptional profitability on sales. Operating income increased from RM 823,903 thousand to RM 897,202 thousand, with operating margin rising from 32.76% to 44.54%, reflecting improved cost control or operational leverage. Net profit increased by 17.4% to RM 711,021 thousand, with net profit margin improving from 24.08% to 35.30%, indicating higher earnings quality and sustainability. Return on equity and assets were strong at 24.77% and 21.60%, respectively, demonstrating efficient use of capital and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate turned negative (-23.83%) from 28.46%, likely due to tax credits or adjustments, which positively impacted net earnings. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved markedly in 2023 despite lower revenue. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased slightly by 1.54% to RM 593,528 thousand, while cost of goods sold rose by 14.3% to RM 711,621 thousand, reflecting higher input costs or volume. Despite this, asset turnover improved significantly from 61.20% to 67.55%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Operating margin declined to 40.63% from 44.54%, suggesting some cost control challenges. Net cash from operations remained stable at RM 688,582 thousand, a slight decrease from RM 690,795 thousand in 2023, indicating consistent cash generation capability. Inventories decreased by 7.1% to RM 228,485 thousand, which may reflect improved inventory management or sales efficiency. Working capital dynamics show increased current liabilities and decreased current assets, which may impact short-term operational liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with improved asset utilization and stable cash flow but margin pressure and tighter working capital. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023 as reflected by an increase in operating margin to 44.54% from 32.76% in 2022, indicating better cost control and expense management. The asset turnover ratio was high at 61.20%, suggesting very efficient use of assets to generate revenue, although this figure is unusually high and may be influenced by the negative cost of goods sold. Net cash from operations decreased from RM 929,129 thousand to RM 690,795 thousand, a decline of about 25.7%, indicating lower cash generation despite higher operating income, which may warrant further investigation. Working capital remained strong with current assets exceeding current liabilities significantly, supported by a current ratio of 634.89%. Inventories increased slightly from RM 219,549 thousand to RM 245,938 thousand, which may impact working capital but remains manageable. Overall, the company demonstrated improved operational margins and asset utilization but experienced a reduction in cash flow from operations in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased modestly as debt to equity rose from 13.90% to 15.22%, driven by higher total liabilities. The current ratio declined from 634.89% to 510.20%, indicating reduced but still very strong liquidity. Interest expense increased slightly from RM 747 thousand to RM 847 thousand, but interest coverage remains extremely high at 105,436.72%, down from 120,107.36%, indicating negligible risk from interest obligations. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, reducing tax burden risk. The net cash from financing activities remained negative at RM (712,294) thousand, reflecting ongoing debt repayments or dividend payments, which could pressure liquidity if sustained. The net decrease in cash of RM (135,754) thousand contrasts with a net increase in 2023, signaling potential liquidity tightening. Overall, financial risk remains low with strong coverage and manageable leverage, but the decline in liquidity ratios and cash position warrants monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a low leverage profile with a debt to equity ratio of 13.90%, slightly improved from 14.32% in 2022, indicating limited reliance on debt financing. Interest expense was negative at RM -747 thousand compared to RM 2,312 thousand in 2022, which is unusual and may reflect interest income or accounting adjustments. Interest coverage ratio was negative (-120,107.36%), a significant change from the very high positive coverage in 2022, suggesting anomalies in interest or earnings calculations that require scrutiny. Liquidity remains strong with a current ratio of 634.89%, indicating excellent short-term solvency. The effective tax rate turned negative (-23.83%) from a positive 28.46%, which may reflect tax benefits or credits but introduces some uncertainty in tax expense predictability. Overall, the company exhibits low financial risk from leverage and liquidity perspectives, but unusual interest and tax figures warrant further analysis to assess potential risks. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities shifted from a net positive cash inflow of RM 112,865 thousand in 2023 to a net outflow of RM (112,042) thousand in 2024, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Revenue growth in key segments—plantations increased from £701,623 to £729,742 and palm oil refining from £1,312,625 to £1,468,068—suggests positive market demand and expansion potential. Geographic revenue growth in Malaysia and Europe, with Malaysia increasing from £1,017,147 to £1,054,118 and Europe from £26,887 to £34,973, indicates strengthening core markets. Dividend payments decreased slightly from RM (746,613) thousand to RM (705,135) thousand, reflecting a stable dividend policy supporting shareholder returns. Net cash from operations remains strong, supporting cash flow sustainability despite increased investing outflows. The negative net cash change in 2024 suggests short-term liquidity management will be important. Overall, the company is positioned for continued growth with ongoing investments and stable cash flows, but careful liquidity and capital allocation management will be critical. | Investment activities in 2023 showed a positive net cash inflow from investing activities of RM 112,865 thousand, a reversal from the RM (190,402) thousand outflow in 2022, indicating possible asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. Financing activities saw increased cash outflows of RM (762,589) thousand compared to RM (496,591) thousand in 2022, driven in part by higher dividends paid (RM 746,613 thousand vs. RM 518,481 thousand), suggesting a shareholder-friendly dividend policy but potentially constraining internal cash reserves. Net increase in cash was modest at RM 41,071 thousand, down from RM 242,136 thousand in 2022, reflecting tighter cash flow conditions. Revenue by geographic region shows a significant decline in Europe revenue from £324,463 thousand to £26,887 thousand, while revenue in the United States increased substantially from £406 thousand to £1,200 thousand, and others increased slightly, indicating shifting market dynamics. The plantations segment revenue remained stable, but palm oil refining revenue declined notably. These trends suggest potential geographic and segmental shifts that may impact future growth.
