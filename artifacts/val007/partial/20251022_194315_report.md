| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 32.76% in 2022 to 44.54% in 2023 but then declined to 40.63% in 2024, reflecting fluctuations in operating efficiency. Operating income increased from MYR 823,903 thousand in 2022 to MYR 897,202 thousand in 2023, then slightly decreased to MYR 893,049 thousand in 2024, despite the revenue drop in 2023, indicating effective cost control. Operating expenses decreased significantly from MYR 700,201 thousand in 2022 to around MYR 500,000 thousand in both 2023 and 2024, demonstrating improved cost management. The reduction in operating expenses helped sustain operating income levels even with lower revenue in 2023, highlighting operational efficiency gains. The ratio of operating income to revenue was highest in 2023 at approximately 44.54%, showing the company managed to optimize operations during a revenue dip. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 28.46% in 2022 to 23.83% in 2023 and further to 23.38% in 2024, which positively impacted net profitability by reducing tax expenses relative to income.

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, United Plantations Berhad's total assets slightly decreased to MYR 3,243,244 thousand from MYR 3,263,605 thousand in 2023, indicating a marginal contraction in asset base. Non-current assets increased modestly, suggesting ongoing investment in long-term assets. Total liabilities rose from MYR 396,185 thousand to MYR 426,015 thousand, driven primarily by an increase in current liabilities (from MYR 186,796 thousand to MYR 222,199 thousand), while non-current liabilities slightly decreased. Shareholders' equity declined to MYR 2,799,779 thousand from MYR 2,850,440 thousand, reflecting the net effect of retained earnings growth and increased liabilities. The current ratio decreased from 634.89% to 510.20%, indicating a reduction in liquidity but still a very strong short-term financial position. The debt to equity ratio increased from 13.90% to 15.22%, showing a slight increase in leverage but remaining low overall. Overall, the company maintains a strong financial health with a solid equity base, conservative leverage, and ample liquidity despite minor shifts in asset and liability composition. | In 2023, United Plantations Berhad's total assets slightly decreased to MYR 3,263,605 thousand from MYR 3,318,800 thousand in 2022, indicating a marginal contraction in asset base. Current assets also declined to MYR 1,185,950 thousand from MYR 1,246,408 thousand, while non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities decreased to MYR 396,185 thousand from MYR 414,039 thousand, driven by a reduction in current liabilities to MYR 186,796 thousand despite a slight increase in non-current liabilities to MYR 209,389 thousand. Shareholders' equity decreased to MYR 2,850,440 thousand from MYR 2,904,761 thousand, reflecting a modest decline in retained earnings. The current ratio improved to 634.89% from 596.03%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 13.90% from 14.25%, suggesting a marginally stronger capital structure with low leverage. Overall, the company maintained a strong financial position with solid liquidity and conservative leverage in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 9.1% to MYR 2,197,810 thousand in 2024 from MYR 2,014,248 thousand in 2023, driven by growth in both plantations and palm oil refining segments. Gross profit improved to MYR 1,486,189 thousand from MYR 1,391,701 thousand, with gross margin rising slightly to 132.38% from 130.91%, indicating effective cost management relative to revenue. However, operating income slightly declined to MYR 893,049 thousand from MYR 897,202 thousand, causing operating margin to fall from 44.54% to 40.63%, reflecting increased operating expenses or cost pressures. Net profit increased marginally to MYR 719,409 thousand from MYR 711,021 thousand, but net profit margin decreased to 32.73% from 35.30%, suggesting some erosion in bottom-line profitability. Return on equity improved to 25.46% from 24.71%, and return on assets increased to 22.11% from 21.60%, indicating enhanced efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 23.38% from 23.83%. Overall, profitability remains strong with revenue growth and solid returns, though margin compression at operating and net levels signals some cost or pricing challenges. | Revenue declined by approximately 19.9% to MYR 2,014,248 thousand in 2023 from MYR 2,514,808 thousand in 2022, primarily due to a significant drop in palm oil refining revenue (from MYR 1,809,493 thousand to MYR 1,312,625 thousand) and lower revenue from Malaysia and Europe. Despite lower revenue, gross profit decreased by only 10.5% to MYR 1,391,701 thousand, supported by a substantial reduction in cost of goods sold to MYR 622,547 thousand from MYR 960,258 thousand. Operating income increased by 8.8% to MYR 897,202 thousand, driven by a 28.5% decrease in operating expenses. Net profit rose by 17.4% to MYR 711,021 thousand, reflecting improved earnings quality and cost management. Margins improved markedly: gross margin remained high at 130.91% (down from 138.18%), operating margin increased to 44.54% from 32.76%, and net profit margin rose to 35.30% from 24.08%. Return on equity and assets were strong at 24.71% and 21.60%, respectively, indicating efficient use of capital and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate decreased to 23.83% from 28.46%, contributing to higher net profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost of goods sold increased in absolute terms to MYR 711,621 thousand from MYR 622,547 thousand, but gross margin improvement suggests cost increases were offset by higher revenue. Operating expenses remained relatively stable at around MYR 504,359 thousand, indicating controlled overheads. Asset turnover improved significantly to 67.55% from 61.20%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories decreased to MYR 228,485 thousand from MYR 245,938 thousand, which may indicate improved inventory management or sales efficiency. Net cash from operations remained stable at MYR 688,582 thousand compared to MYR 690,795 thousand, showing consistent cash generation from core business activities. Working capital dynamics show a decrease in current assets and increase in current liabilities, which may require monitoring. Cash flow from investing activities remained steady at approximately MYR 112,042 thousand outflow, indicating ongoing investment. Overall, operational efficiency improved with better asset utilization and stable cash flows, though working capital management warrants attention. | United Plantations Berhad demonstrated improved operational efficiency in 2023. Cost control was evident as cost of goods sold and operating expenses both declined significantly, supporting higher operating income despite lower revenue. The asset turnover ratio was notably high at 61.20%, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories increased slightly to MYR 245,938 thousand from MYR 219,549 thousand, which may reflect inventory buildup or strategic stockpiling. Net cash from operations decreased to MYR 690,795 thousand from MYR 929,129 thousand, signaling lower cash generation from core business activities, possibly due to reduced revenue. Working capital remained strong with a current ratio of 634.89%, reflecting ample liquidity to cover short-term obligations. Cash flow from investing activities turned positive to MYR 112,865 thousand from a negative MYR 190,402 thousand, suggesting asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. Overall, operational efficiency improved through cost management and asset utilization, though cash flow from operations softened. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased slightly as debt to equity rose to 15.22% from 13.90%, but remains low, indicating limited financial risk from debt. Interest expense increased marginally to MYR 847 thousand from MYR 747 thousand, but interest coverage remains extremely high at 105,436.72%, down from 120,107.36%, reflecting very strong ability to service interest obligations. The current ratio decreased to 510.20% from 634.89%, signaling reduced but still very strong liquidity. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, indicating stable tax environment without adverse changes. No significant spikes in liabilities or cash flow volatility are observed. However, the increase in current liabilities and slight decrease in current assets suggest a need to monitor short-term liquidity closely. Overall, financial risk remains low with strong coverage and liquidity metrics, but vigilance on working capital and leverage trends is advisable. | Financial risk indicators for 2023 show a low leverage profile with a debt to equity ratio of 13.90%, slightly improved from 14.25% in 2022, indicating limited reliance on debt financing. Interest expense was minimal at MYR 747 thousand, down from MYR 2,312 thousand, resulting in an exceptionally high interest coverage ratio of 120,107.36%, reflecting strong ability to meet interest obligations. Liquidity remains robust with a current ratio of 634.89%, up from 596.03%, signaling strong short-term financial flexibility. The effective tax rate decreased to 23.83% from 28.46%, which may reduce tax-related risks. No significant increases in non-current liabilities were observed, and cash flow from financing activities turned positive to MYR 762,589 thousand from a negative MYR 496,591 thousand, indicating possible new financing or capital inflows. Overall, the company exhibits low financial risk with strong liquidity, minimal debt burden, and excellent interest coverage in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity remains consistent with net cash used in investing at MYR 112,042 thousand, similar to prior year, indicating ongoing capital expenditure to support future growth. Net cash from financing decreased to MYR 712,294 thousand from MYR 762,589 thousand, and dividends paid declined to MYR 705,135 thousand from MYR 746,613 thousand, suggesting a slightly more conservative dividend policy or capital allocation approach. Revenue growth in plantations and palm oil refining segments, along with geographic expansion evidenced by increased revenue from Europe, United States, and Others regions, signals diversification and potential for sustained top-line growth. Cash flow from operations remains robust, supporting dividend sustainability and investment capacity. The company’s strong equity base and low leverage provide financial flexibility for future opportunities. Overall, United Plantations Berhad is positioned for stable future financial performance with balanced investment, cash flow sustainability, and geographic and segment growth cues. | The positive net cash from investing activities of MYR 112,865 thousand in 2023, reversing from a negative cash outflow in 2022, suggests potential asset sales or reduced capital expenditure, which may impact future growth investments. The substantial positive net cash from financing activities of MYR 762,589 thousand, compared to a large outflow in 2022, indicates new financing or capital injections that could support future expansion or dividend payments. However, the reported dividends in 2023 are MYR 746,613 thousand, a significant increase from the previous year's outflow of MYR 518,481 thousand, implying a strong dividend policy and commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue by segment shows a decline in palm oil refining and plantations, with palm oil refining revenue dropping by approximately 27.4%, and plantations revenue slightly decreasing, which may signal challenges or strategic shifts in these core segments. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia and Europe declined sharply, while revenue from 'Others' increased, suggesting a possible geographic revenue concentration shift. Given these factors, future financial performance may depend on sustaining cash flow from operations, managing investment activities prudently, and navigating segmental and geographic revenue shifts while maintaining shareholder returns. |

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | United Plantations Berhad faces several economic challenges and uncertainties in 2025 as outlined in the 2024 annual report. These include the ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, the fragile economic conditions in China and Europe, and the potential policy changes under the new US administration which could impact global trade, energy, interest rates, and economic stability. Inflation risks persist, dampening consumer sentiment and spending power, aggravated by rising living costs. The company anticipates a possible softening of palm oil prices due to reduced demand and lower mineral oil prices, affecting the biodiesel market. Cost pressures remain significant with high labor costs, and elevated prices for energy, fertilizers, chemicals, and building materials, exerting upward pressure on the cost base. The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risks, particularly fluctuations in USD against RM and IDR, and interest rate risks affecting profit through interest income. Additionally, global trade challenges arise from rising protectionism, supply chain shifts, and geopolitical conflicts. The company is preparing for these uncertainties by focusing on cost efficiencies, mechanization, replanting with superior planting materials, and productivity improvements. The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) introduces regulatory uncertainty with delayed implementation, requiring enhanced traceability and compliance efforts. Overall, the economic environment is marked by volatility in commodity prices, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory changes that could impact revenue and profitability. | The 2023 annual report highlights several forward-looking economic challenges and uncertainties. The global economic outlook for 2024 is forecasted to be gloomier with a projected slowdown in global growth from 2.6% in 2023 to 2.4% in 2024, accompanied by lower global trade growth and persistently high borrowing costs, especially for developing economies. High interest rates, which have peaked but remain elevated, are expected to adversely affect highly geared businesses and consumer spending. Geopolitical conflicts, including those in Ukraine and the Middle East, add to global economic uncertainty and impact supply chains. The palm oil market faces potential price softening due to expected reduced demand and supply-demand imbalances influenced by extreme weather patterns and increased biodiesel production.
