# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue has shown a declining trend from 2022 (£3,189,782) to 2024 (£2,937,875), with a decrease of approximately 7.9%. Gross Margin has also decreased from 31.18% in 2022 to 27.90% in 2024, indicating a reduction in profitability per unit of revenue. The revenue breakdown by product shows that the Plantation segment has grown from £1,587,654 in 2022 to £1,797,913 in 2024, while Downstream Manufacturing has decreased from £1,512,252 in 2022 to £1,008,468 in 2024. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia has decreased significantly from £2,006,662 in 2022 to £1,495,101 in 2024, while revenue from Indonesia has increased slightly from £1,183,120 in 2022 to £1,442,774 in 2024, indicating a shift in market dynamics. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating Margin has declined from 23.34% in 2022 to 19.09% in 2024, reflecting a decrease in operational efficiency. Operating income has also decreased from £744,614 in 2022 to £560,779 in 2024, despite a slight increase in operating expenses from £290,092 in 2022 to £339,086 in 2024. This suggests that cost management may be becoming less effective, as the increase in operating expenses is not being matched by a proportional increase in revenue. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The Effective Tax Rate has increased from 29.84% in 2022 to 30.31% in 2024, which may be impacting net profitability. Non-recurring items are not explicitly mentioned, but the overall decline in net profit from £483,331 in 2022 to £334,955 in 2024 suggests that external factors, possibly including market conditions or increased competition, are adversely affecting profitability. |

| Financial risk identification and early warning | In 2024, the debt to equity ratio increased to 80.50%, indicating higher financial leverage and potential risk in debt management. The current ratio of 135.85% suggests a decline in liquidity, which could pose risks in meeting short-term obligations. The interest coverage ratio remained strong at 453.46%, indicating the company can comfortably cover interest expenses. However, the effective tax rate increased slightly to 30.31%, which could impact net profitability. Overall, while the company has a strong interest coverage, the rising leverage and declining liquidity are concerning. | In 2023, the debt to equity ratio was 57.63%, indicating a moderate level of financial leverage. The current ratio of 187.83% suggested a strong liquidity position, allowing the company to meet short-term liabilities effectively. The interest coverage ratio was 419.88%, reflecting a solid ability to cover interest expenses. The effective tax rate was 30.81%, slightly higher than the previous year. Overall, the financial risk profile appeared stable, but the increasing debt levels and declining liquidity trends warrant close monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Based on the 2024 data, the company is likely to face challenges in revenue growth due to declining sales figures. However, improvements in gross and operating margins suggest potential for enhanced profitability if cost management continues to be prioritized. The increase in cash flow from financing activities indicates a potential for investment in growth opportunities. The company should focus on market expansion and operational efficiency to sustain cash flow and support future growth. | In 2023, the company faced declining revenues, which may impact future growth projections. However, the stable gross and operating margins indicate that profitability can be maintained through effective cost management. The negative cash flow from financing activities suggests a need for careful capital management. Future projections should focus on improving operational efficiency and exploring new market opportunities to drive revenue growth and enhance financial stability. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The company faces economic challenges due to higher energy costs and inflation driven by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Rising fuel and fertilizer prices have significantly increased plantation production costs. Additionally, a larger supply of competing vegetable oils, due to the recovery of soybean production in Argentina and sunflower production in the Black Sea region, is adding market pressure. The volatility in palm oil prices, trading from as low as RM3,622 to RM5,333 per metric tonne, is influenced by slower-than-expected production growth in Indonesia and strong demand from key importing countries. These factors create uncertainties in revenue and profitability. | In 2023, the company faced significant economic challenges due to heightened macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from elevated inflation and prolonged high interest rates. The volatility of palm oil prices was influenced by various factors, including supply and demand dynamics, weather conditions, and geopolitical risks, particularly the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Israel-Palestine region. The average price of crude palm oil (CPO) decreased by 15% compared to the previous year, reflecting weak demand sentiment and high stockpiles. Additionally, the company experienced a 7% decline in revenue year-on-year, with pre-tax profit dropping to RM384 million, indicating a weaker performance in both the Plantation and Downstream Manufacturing divisions. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The company is experiencing intense competition from Indonesian counterparts, particularly in its refinery operations and the downstream manufacturing segment. The palm-based biodiesel business is primarily catering to the Malaysian biodiesel mandate, but faces challenges due to limited export market opportunities and the need to reduce production expenses, especially energy costs. The competitive landscape is further complicated by the latest revisions in Indonesia's export levies and refinery overcapacity, which may impact the company's market position. | The Downstream Manufacturing segment is anticipated to face stiffer competition from Indonesian counterparts, which benefit from competitive pricing for feedstock due to export tax differentials. This intense price competition, particularly in the biodiesel market, poses challenges for the company's operations. Furthermore, the biodiesel unit's export sales remain minimal due to restrictions from the European Union on palm-based biodiesel, exacerbating competitive pressures in the market. |


## S6.3: Innovation and Development Plans
