# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | GENTING PLANTATIONS BERHAD's revenue shows a declining trend from MYR 3,189,782 thousand in 2022 to MYR 2,966,451 thousand in 2023, and further down to MYR 2,937,875 thousand in 2024. Correspondingly, the gross margin decreased from 31.18% in 2022 to 25.22% in 2023 but improved slightly to 27.90% in 2024, indicating some recovery in cost control relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service reveals that Plantation revenue steadily increased from MYR 1,587,654 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,797,913 thousand in 2024, while Downstream Manufacturing revenue declined from MYR 1,512,252 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,008,468 thousand in 2024. Property and AgTech segments showed moderate growth. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia decreased from MYR 2,006,662 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,495,101 thousand in 2024, whereas Indonesia revenue increased from MYR 1,183,120 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,442,774 thousand in 2024, indicating a shift in regional revenue contribution. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 23.34% in 2022 to 15.11% in 2023 but improved to 19.09% in 2024, reflecting fluctuating operating efficiency. Operating income decreased from MYR 744,614 thousand in 2022 to MYR 448,177 thousand in 2023, then rose to MYR 560,779 thousand in 2024, consistent with the margin trend. Operating expenses increased from MYR 310,128 thousand in 2022 to MYR 338,086 thousand in 2024, but the rise was moderate relative to revenue changes, suggesting some cost management efforts. The improvement in operating margin in 2024 despite lower revenue compared to 2022 indicates enhanced operational control and efficiency gains. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, slightly increasing from 29.84% in 2022 to 30.81% in 2023 and marginally decreasing to 30.31% in 2024, which had a consistent impact on net profitability. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, indicating that the profitability trends primarily reflect core business performance without significant one-off impacts. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Genting Plantations Berhad's total assets increased significantly to MYR 9,624,289 thousand from MYR 8,567,093 thousand in 2023, driven primarily by a substantial rise in current assets from MYR 1,886,975 thousand to MYR 3,038,531 thousand, despite a slight decline in non-current assets. Total liabilities also rose markedly to MYR 4,292,318 thousand from MYR 3,132,227 thousand, with current liabilities more than doubling to MYR 2,236,716 thousand, while non-current liabilities slightly decreased. Shareholders' equity decreased marginally to MYR 5,331,971 thousand from MYR 5,434,866 thousand, indicating a slight contraction in net book value. The current ratio declined from 187.83% to 135.85%, reflecting reduced short-term liquidity but still above 1, suggesting adequate coverage of current liabilities by current assets. The debt to equity ratio increased notably from 57.63% to 80.50%, indicating a higher leverage and greater reliance on debt financing in 2024. Overall, the company shows growth in asset base and liabilities with a moderate decrease in equity, maintaining reasonable liquidity but with increased financial leverage. | In 2023, Genting Plantations Berhad's total assets slightly decreased to MYR 8,567,093 thousand from MYR 8,791,814 thousand in 2022, reflecting a modest contraction in asset base. Current assets declined more significantly from MYR 2,463,093 thousand to MYR 1,886,975 thousand, while non-current assets increased from MYR 6,328,721 thousand to MYR 6,680,118 thousand, indicating a shift towards longer-term asset holdings. Total liabilities reduced from MYR 3,482,644 thousand to MYR 3,132,227 thousand, driven by decreases in both current liabilities (MYR 1,144,470 thousand to MYR 1,004,606 thousand) and non-current liabilities (MYR 2,338,174 thousand to MYR 2,127,621 thousand). Shareholders' equity increased slightly to MYR 5,434,866 thousand from MYR 5,309,170 thousand, supported by stable retained earnings. The current ratio decreased from 215.22% to 187.83%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity but still maintaining a comfortable buffer above 1. The debt to equity ratio improved from 65.60% to 57.63%, reflecting a lower leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company maintained solid financial health with a conservative capital structure and adequate liquidity, despite some contraction in current assets and total asset base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue slightly decreased to MYR 2,937,875 thousand in 2024 from MYR 2,966,451 thousand in 2023, a marginal decline. However, cost of goods sold decreased more significantly to MYR 2,118,167 thousand from MYR 2,218,456 thousand, resulting in an improved gross profit of MYR 819,708 thousand compared to MYR 747,995 thousand previously. This improvement is reflected in the gross margin rising from 25.22% to 27.90%. Operating expenses increased to MYR 338,086 thousand from MYR 299,818 thousand, but operating income still grew substantially to MYR 560,779 thousand from MYR 448,177 thousand, lifting the operating margin from 15.11% to 19.09%. Net profit increased to MYR 334,955 thousand from MYR 265,788 thousand, with net profit margin improving from 8.96% to 11.40%. Income before taxes and interest expense both increased, but the effective tax rate slightly decreased from 30.81% to 30.31%. Return on equity and return on assets remain very low but positive at 0.01% and 0.00% respectively, indicating modest earnings relative to equity and assets. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved in 2024 with better margins and higher net income despite slightly lower revenue. | Revenue for 2023 was reported as MYR 2,966.451 thousand, which appears inconsistent with segment and geographic revenue data (in millions), suggesting a possible unit or reporting discrepancy. However, comparing segment revenues in thousands, plantation revenue increased from MYR 1,587,654 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,745,185 thousand in 2023, and property and AgTech segments also showed growth, while downstream manufacturing revenue declined. Geographically, revenue from Indonesia increased from MYR 1,183,120 thousand to MYR 1,390,317 thousand, while Malaysia's revenue decreased from MYR 2,006,662 thousand to MYR 1,576,134 thousand. Profitability margins declined notably: gross margin fell from 31.18% to 25.22%, operating margin from 23.34% to 15.11%, and net profit margin from 15.15% to 8.96%, indicating margin compression and lower earnings quality. Net profit decreased from MYR 483,331 thousand to MYR 265,788 thousand, a significant reduction. Return on equity and return on assets were both reported as 0.00%, suggesting either negligible returns or data unavailability. The effective tax rate increased slightly from 29.84% to 30.81%. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with lower margins and net income, despite some revenue growth in key segments and regions. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency shows mixed trends in 2024. Cost control appears effective as cost of goods sold decreased by approximately 4.5% while revenue slightly declined, improving gross profit. However, operating expenses increased by about 12.7%, which partially offset operating income gains. Asset turnover remained flat at 0.03%, indicating stable but low utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations declined significantly to MYR 494,137 thousand from MYR 656,113 thousand in 2023, suggesting reduced cash generation efficiency. Inventories increased from MYR 193,039 thousand to MYR 277,352 thousand, which may indicate higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Working capital increased substantially due to a large rise in current assets and current liabilities, with current liabilities more than doubling. Cash flow from investing activities remained negative but improved slightly, while cash flow from financing activities reversed from a large outflow to a significant inflow, contributing to a net increase in cash of MYR 832,749 thousand. Overall, operational efficiency improved in cost control but cash flow from operations weakened and asset utilization remained low. | Cost of goods sold increased slightly from MYR 2,195,142 thousand in 2022 to MYR 2,218,456 thousand in 2023, while operating expenses decreased marginally from MYR 310,128 thousand to MYR 299,818 thousand, indicating some cost control on operating expenses but rising direct costs. Operating income declined sharply from MYR 744,614 thousand to MYR 448,177 thousand, reflecting reduced operational profitability. Inventories decreased from MYR 270,385 thousand to MYR 193,039 thousand, which may indicate improved inventory management or lower stock levels. Asset turnover was very low at 0.03 in 2023, suggesting limited efficiency in generating revenue from assets. Net cash from operations declined significantly from MYR 958,267 thousand to MYR 656,113 thousand, indicating reduced cash generation from core business activities. Working capital also contracted as current assets and current liabilities both decreased, with the current ratio falling. Net cash used in investing activities slightly increased in outflow from MYR (397,402) thousand to MYR (408,574) thousand, showing continued investment. Net cash used in financing activities increased from MYR (615,800) thousand to MYR (776,301) thousand, reflecting higher financing outflows, possibly due to dividends or debt repayments. Dividends paid decreased from MYR (305,048) thousand to MYR (242,244) thousand. Overall, operational efficiency weakened with lower cash flow from operations, reduced margins, and low asset turnover, despite some cost control on operating expenses. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators suggest increased leverage and liquidity risk in 2024. The debt to equity ratio rose sharply from 57.63% to 80.50%, indicating higher financial leverage and potential increased risk from debt obligations. The current ratio decreased from 187.83% to 135.85%, reflecting reduced short-term liquidity buffer, though still above 1. Interest expense increased to MYR 123,667 thousand from MYR 106,740 thousand, but interest coverage ratio improved from 419.88% to 453.46%, indicating strong ability to cover interest payments from operating income. The effective tax rate slightly decreased, which may marginally improve net profitability. The significant increase in current liabilities, more than doubling, could pose liquidity pressure if not managed carefully. No other explicit risk metrics are provided, but the combination of higher leverage and lower liquidity ratio warrants monitoring. Overall, financial risk has increased moderately due to higher debt and reduced liquidity, though interest coverage remains strong. | Leverage indicators improved in 2023 with the debt to equity ratio decreasing from 65.60% to 57.63%, indicating reduced financial risk from lower relative debt levels. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 215.22% to 187.83%, still indicating a strong liquidity position but with some erosion. Interest expense increased from MYR 91,121 thousand to MYR 106,740 thousand, while interest coverage ratio decreased significantly from 817.17% to 419.88%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest expenses from operating income, though still at a comfortable level. The effective tax rate increased slightly from 29.84% to 30.81%, which may marginally impact net profitability. The significant decline in net profit and operating income, combined with lower cash from operations, could signal emerging operational risks. The large net cash outflow in financing activities and the decrease in cash balances (net decrease in cash of MYR 528,762 thousand) may also indicate liquidity pressure. Overall, while leverage and liquidity remain manageable, the decline in profitability and cash flow metrics warrants monitoring for potential financial stress. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Genting Plantations Berhad's investment activity in 2024 shows a slight reduction in net cash used for investing activities to MYR (376,196) thousand from MYR (408,574) thousand, indicating continued but moderated capital expenditure or acquisitions. The large positive net cash from financing activities of MYR 714,808 thousand, reversing from a large outflow in 2023, suggests new debt or equity financing inflows that may support growth or liquidity. Dividend payments decreased to MYR (188,404) thousand from MYR (242,244) thousand, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue by product shows growth in Plantation and Property segments, with Plantation revenue increasing to MYR 1,797,913 thousand and Property to MYR 127,094 thousand, while AgTech revenue nearly doubled and Downstream Manufacturing revenue declined. Geographically, revenue from Indonesia increased while Malaysia's revenue decreased slightly, suggesting shifting regional dynamics. The net increase in cash of MYR 832,749 thousand supports cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company appears positioned for stable future performance with ongoing investments, adjusted dividend policy, and growth in key segments and regions, though monitoring of financing structure and operational cash flow will be important. | Investment activity remained consistent with a net cash outflow from investing activities of MYR (408,574) thousand, slightly higher than the previous year, indicating ongoing capital expenditure or acquisitions to support future growth. The decrease in dividends paid from MYR (305,048) thousand to MYR (242,244) thousand suggests a more conservative dividend policy, possibly to preserve cash amid lower profitability. Revenue growth in the plantation segment and Indonesia geographic region indicates potential areas of future strength, while declines in downstream manufacturing and Malaysia revenue may require strategic focus. The increase in non-current assets supports a longer-term investment horizon. However, the significant reduction in net cash from operations and net profit raises concerns about cash flow sustainability. The company’s improved capital structure and maintained liquidity provide a foundation for future financial stability, but operational improvements are needed to enhance profitability and cash generation. Overall, Genting Plantations Berhad appears to be investing for future growth with cautious cash management, but must address profitability and operational efficiency challenges to ensure sustainable financial performance. |
