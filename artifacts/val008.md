# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue has shown a declining trend from 2022 (£3,189,782) to 2024 (£2,937,875), indicating a decrease of approximately 7.9%. Gross Margin has also decreased from 31.18% in 2022 to 27.90% in 2024, reflecting increased cost pressures. The breakdown of revenue by product shows that Plantation revenue increased from £1,587,654 in 2022 to £1,797,913 in 2024, while Downstream Manufacturing revenue decreased from £1,512,252 in 2022 to £1,008,468 in 2024. Geographic revenue distribution indicates a significant decline in Malaysia from £2,006,662 in 2022 to £1,495,101 in 2024, while Indonesia has shown a slight increase from £1,183,120 in 2022 to £1,442,774 in 2024. |

This suggests that cost management has not been effective in maintaining profitability as revenue has declined. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The Effective Tax Rate has increased slightly from 29.84% in 2022 to 30.31% in 2024, which may have contributed to the decline in net profit. Non-recurring items were not specified, but the overall decline in net profit from £483,331 in 2022 to £334,955 in 2024 indicates potential external factors affecting profitability, such as market conditions or increased competition. |
