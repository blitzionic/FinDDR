# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from MYR 3,189,782 thousand in 2022 to MYR 2,966,451 thousand in 2023, a decrease of approximately 7.01%, and further decreased slightly to MYR 2,937,875 thousand in 2024, a 0.96% decline from 2023. Gross profit followed a similar downward trend, dropping from MYR 994,640 thousand in 2022 to MYR 747,995 thousand in 2023 (a 24.75% decrease), then rebounding to MYR 819,708 thousand in 2024 (a 9.56% increase from 2023). Despite the revenue decline, gross margin improved from 168.82% in 2022 to 174.78% in 2023 and slightly decreased to 172.10% in 2024, indicating better cost control or product mix improvements. Revenue by product/service shows Plantation revenue grew steadily from MYR 1,587,654 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,797,913 thousand in 2024, a 13.2% increase over three years. Property revenue also increased from MYR 88,966 thousand in 2022 to MYR 127,094 thousand in 2024 (42.8% growth). AgTech revenue showed strong growth from MYR 910 thousand in 2022 to MYR 4,400 thousand in 2024 (384.6% increase), though it remains a small portion of total revenue. Downstream Manufacturing revenue declined significantly from MYR 1,512,252 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,008,468 thousand in 2024 (33.3% decrease). Geographically, revenue from Malaysia decreased sharply from MYR 2,006,662 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,495,101 thousand in 2024 (25.5% decline), while Indonesia revenue increased from MYR 1,183,120 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,442,774 thousand in 2024 (21.9% growth), indicating a geographic shift in revenue concentration towards Indonesia. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income declined from MYR 744,614 thousand in 2022 to MYR 448,177 thousand in 2023 (a 39.8% decrease), then improved to MYR 560,779 thousand in 2024 (a 25.1% increase from 2023). Operating margin followed a similar pattern, dropping from 23.34% in 2022 to 15.11% in 2023, then recovering to 19.09% in 2024. The operating income to revenue ratio indicates a deterioration in 2023 but partial recovery in 2024, reflecting operational challenges in 2023 with some efficiency gains in 2024. Operating expenses increased slightly from MYR 328,769 thousand in 2023 to MYR 338,086 thousand in 2024, but data for 2022 operating expenses is not available for comparison. Overall, cost management appears to have improved in 2024 as operating income grew despite a slight increase in operating expenses, suggesting better control over direct costs and operational efficiency. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable over the three years, at 29.84% in 2022, 30.81% in 2023, and 30.31% in 2024, indicating consistent tax expense relative to pre-tax income. Income tax expense decreased from MYR 205,542 thousand in 2022 to MYR 118,350 thousand in 2023, then increased to MYR 145,713 thousand in 2024, consistent with fluctuations in pre-tax profitability. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the provided information. External factors impacting profitability include the geographic revenue shift from Malaysia to Indonesia, which may reflect market or regulatory changes affecting revenue streams and profitability. The decline in downstream manufacturing revenue and growth in AgTech and property segments suggest strategic shifts or external market pressures influencing business segments. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated an overall stronger financial position with total assets increasing from MYR 8,567,093 thousand in 2023 to MYR 9,624,289 thousand, reflecting significant asset growth primarily driven by a rise in current assets from MYR 1,886,975 thousand to MYR 3,038,531 thousand. However, non-current assets slightly decreased from MYR 6,680,118 thousand to MYR 6,585,758 thousand. Total liabilities increased notably from MYR 3,132,227 thousand to MYR 4,292,318 thousand, mainly due to a sharp rise in current liabilities from MYR 1,004,606 thousand to MYR 2,236,716 thousand, while non-current liabilities slightly decreased. Shareholders' equity declined marginally from MYR 5,434,866 thousand to MYR 5,331,971 thousand despite an increase in retained earnings from MYR 3,941,423 thousand to MYR 4,080,091 thousand. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, decreased from 187.83% to 135.85%, indicating reduced short-term liquidity but still above 1. The debt to equity ratio increased from 57.63% to 80.50%, signaling higher leverage and a shift towards more debt financing. Overall, the balance sheet shows growth in assets and liabilities with a slight contraction in equity, reflecting an aggressive expansion financed by increased liabilities and a moderate decline in liquidity ratios. | In 2023, the company’s total assets slightly decreased to MYR 8,567,093 thousand from MYR 8,791,814 thousand in 2022, indicating a modest contraction in asset base. Non-current assets increased to MYR 6,680,118 thousand, offsetting the decline in current assets to MYR 1,886,975 thousand. Total liabilities reduced to MYR 3,132,227 thousand from MYR 3,482,644 thousand, reflecting effective liability management and a stronger balance sheet. Current liabilities decreased to MYR 1,004,606 thousand, improving short-term obligations. Shareholders’ equity increased to MYR 5,434,866 thousand from MYR 5,209,563 thousand, supported by retained earnings of MYR 3,941,423 thousand, though slightly lower than the prior year. The current ratio declined from 215.22% to 187.83%, indicating a reduction in liquidity but still maintaining a comfortable buffer above 1. The debt to equity ratio improved from 66.85% to 57.63%, signaling a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained a solid financial position with strengthened equity and controlled liabilities despite a slight dip in total assets and liquidity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue slightly decreased from MYR 2,966,451 thousand in 2023 to MYR 2,937,875 thousand in 2024, a marginal decline. Despite this, gross profit improved from MYR 747,995 thousand to MYR 819,708 thousand, driven by a reduction in cost of goods sold from MYR 2,218,456 thousand to MYR 2,118,167 thousand. Gross margin slightly decreased from 174.78% to 172.10%, indicating stable but slightly compressed gross profitability. Operating income increased significantly from MYR 448,177 thousand to MYR 560,779 thousand, with operating margin improving from 15.11% to 19.09%, reflecting better cost control or operational leverage. Net profit rose from MYR 265,788 thousand to MYR 334,955 thousand, with net profit margin increasing from 8.96% to 11.40%, indicating enhanced bottom-line profitability. Return on equity improved from 4.99% to 6.22%, and return on assets increased from 3.06% to 3.68%, both suggesting better earnings quality and more efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from 30.81% to 30.31%. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved in 2024 despite a slight revenue decline, supported by better margin management and returns. | Revenue declined by 6.99% to MYR 2,966,451 thousand in 2023 from MYR 3,189,782 thousand in 2022. Cost of goods sold increased slightly to MYR 2,218,456 thousand, resulting in a gross profit decrease to MYR 747,995 thousand from MYR 994,640 thousand. However, the gross margin improved to 174.78% from 168.82%, indicating better cost efficiency relative to revenue. Operating income dropped significantly by 39.77% to MYR 448,177 thousand, with operating expenses at MYR 328,769 thousand (not available in 2022 for direct comparison). Net profit declined sharply by 45.01% to MYR 265,788 thousand, with net profit margin falling to 8.96% from 15.15%. Return on equity was 4.99% and return on assets 3.06%, both indicating modest profitability and earnings sustainability. The effective tax rate slightly increased to 30.81%. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with lower revenue and net income, but improved gross margin suggests some operational cost control benefits. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased slightly from MYR 328,769 thousand to MYR 338,086 thousand, but operating income grew more substantially, indicating improved operating margin from 15.11% to 19.09%. Asset turnover decreased from 34.18% to 32.30%, suggesting a slight decline in asset utilization efficiency. Net cash from operations declined from MYR 656,113 thousand to MYR 494,137 thousand, indicating reduced cash generation from core operations despite higher operating income, which may reflect changes in working capital or non-cash items. Inventories increased from MYR 193,039 thousand to MYR 277,352 thousand, which could impact working capital management. Overall, the company improved cost control and operating profitability but experienced a decline in asset turnover and operational cash flow, signaling potential efficiency challenges in asset use and cash conversion. | Operating margin decreased to 15.11% in 2023 from 23.34% in 2022, reflecting higher operating expenses relative to revenue. Asset turnover was 34.18%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations declined by 31.53% to MYR 656,113 thousand, signaling reduced cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased to MYR 193,039 thousand from MYR 270,385 thousand, suggesting improved inventory management or lower stock levels. Working capital contracted as current assets and current liabilities both decreased, with the current ratio falling but remaining healthy. Overall, operational efficiency showed some strain with lower operating margin and cash flow, but asset utilization remained strong. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio rising from 57.63% to 80.50%, indicating higher financial risk due to increased reliance on debt. Current liabilities more than doubled, causing the current ratio to fall from 187.83% to 135.85%, which, while still above 1, signals reduced liquidity buffer. Interest expense increased from MYR 106,740 thousand to MYR 123,667 thousand, but interest coverage improved from 419.88% to 453.46%, reflecting strong ability to meet interest obligations despite higher debt. The effective tax rate remained stable, minimizing tax-related risk. The increase in liabilities and reduced liquidity ratios suggest elevated short-term financial risk, but strong interest coverage mitigates immediate solvency concerns. | Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio improved to 57.63% from 66.85%, reducing financial risk. Interest expense increased to MYR 106,740 thousand from MYR 91,121 thousand, but interest coverage ratio declined significantly to 419.88% from 817.17%, indicating reduced but still strong ability to cover interest payments. The current ratio fell to 187.83% from 215.22%, showing a slight decline in liquidity but still a comfortable margin above 1. The effective tax rate increased marginally to 30.81%, which may impact net profitability. The decline in net cash from operations and increased net cash outflow from financing activities (MYR -776,301 thousand) could signal potential liquidity pressures if trends continue. Overall, financial risk remains moderate with improved leverage but caution warranted on interest coverage and cash flow trends. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities showed a slight reduction in net cash used for investing from MYR (408,574) thousand in 2023 to MYR (376,196) thousand in 2024, indicating continued but moderated capital expenditure or acquisitions. Net cash from financing reversed from an outflow of MYR (776,301) thousand in 2023 to an inflow of MYR 714,808 thousand in 2024, suggesting new debt or equity financing to support growth or liquidity. Dividends paid decreased from MYR (242,244) thousand to MYR (188,404) thousand, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue by product shows growth in Plantation (from £1,745,185m to £1,797,913m), Property (from £102,003m to £127,094m), and AgTech (from £2,317m to £4,400m), but a decline in Downstream Manufacturing (from £1,116,946m to £1,008,468m), suggesting shifting business segment dynamics. Geographically, revenue in Indonesia increased (from £1,390,317m to £1,442,774m) while Malaysia declined (from £1,576,134m to £1,495,101m), indicating growth opportunities in Indonesia. Overall, the company appears to be investing selectively, managing cash flow prudently, and focusing on growth in specific segments and regions, which bodes well for future financial performance. | Investment activities remained consistent with net cash used in investing at MYR -408,574 thousand, slightly higher than 2022, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities increased outflow to MYR -776,301 thousand, reflecting higher repayments or dividend payments, though dividends paid decreased to MYR -242,244 thousand from MYR -305,048 thousand, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy. Revenue by product shows growth in Plantation (from £1,587,654m to £1,745,185m), Property (£88,966m to £102,003m), and AgTech (£910m to £2,317m), but a decline in Downstream Manufacturing (£1,512,252m to £1,116,946m), indicating shifting business segment dynamics. Geographically, revenue in Malaysia decreased (from £2,006,662m to £1,576,134m) while Indonesia increased (from £1,183,120m to £1,390,317m), suggesting growth opportunities in Indonesia. Cash flow sustainability is challenged by lower operational cash flow and higher financing outflows, but ongoing investments and geographic/product diversification may support future growth if operational efficiencies improve. |
