# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from MYR 3,189,782K in 2022 to MYR 2,966,451K in 2023 (-7.01%), and further to MYR 2,937,875K in 2024 (-0.95%), indicating a consistent downward trend over the three years. Gross profit followed a similar pattern, dropping from MYR 994,640K in 2022 to MYR 747,995K in 2023 (-24.75%), then slightly recovering to MYR 819,708K in 2024 (+9.56%). Correspondingly, gross margin decreased from 31.18% in 2022 to 25.22% in 2023, before improving to 27.90% in 2024, reflecting some recovery in cost control or pricing power. Revenue by product/service shows that sales of plantation products and produce decreased from £2,414,067K in 2022 to £2,341,135K in 2023 (-2.97%) but rebounded to £2,476,448K in 2024 (+5.74%). Development properties revenue increased steadily from £84,914K in 2022 to £124,221K in 2024 (+46.3% over three years). Palm oil derivative products revenue declined significantly from £1,512,252K in 2022 to £1,116,946K in 2023 (-26.13%) and further to £1,008,468K in 2024 (-9.72%). Genomics-based products and management services revenues showed modest growth. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia decreased sharply from £2,006,662K in 2022 to £1,495,101K in 2024 (-25.47%), while Indonesia revenue increased from £1,183,120K in 2022 to £1,442,774K in 2024 (+21.91%), indicating a strategic shift or market dynamics favoring Indonesia over Malaysia. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income declined from MYR 744,614K in 2022 to MYR 448,177K in 2023 (-39.77%) but improved to MYR 560,779K in 2024 (+25.11%). Operating margin mirrored this trend, dropping from 23.34% in 2022 to 15.11% in 2023, then rising to 19.09% in 2024. Operating expenses decreased slightly from MYR 310,128K in 2022 to MYR 299,769K in 2023 (-3.39%) but increased to MYR 338,345K in 2024 (+12.87%), suggesting some reinvestment or cost pressures. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that despite revenue declines, the company managed to improve operating efficiency in 2024 compared to 2023, as evidenced by the higher operating margin and increased operating income. Cost management appears mixed: while gross margin improved in 2024, operating expenses rose, indicating partial success in controlling direct costs but increased overhead or operational spending. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable over the period: 29.84% in 2022, 30.81% in 2023, and 30.31% in 2024, indicating no significant tax policy changes or tax planning impacts. Income tax expense decreased from MYR 205,542K in 2022 to MYR 118,350K in 2023 (-42.43%) and then increased to MYR 145,713K in 2024 (+23.13%), consistent with fluctuations in pre-tax profitability. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the provided information. External factors inferred include geographic revenue shifts, with Malaysia's revenue declining and Indonesia's increasing, possibly reflecting market or regulatory changes impacting profitability. The decline in palm oil derivative product revenue may also reflect external market or commodity price pressures affecting this segment. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated an overall stronger financial position with total assets increasing by approximately 12.4% from MYR 8,567,093 thousand in 2023 to MYR 9,624,289 thousand. This growth was primarily driven by a significant rise in current assets, which surged from MYR 1,886,975 thousand to MYR 3,038,531 thousand, indicating improved liquidity. However, non-current assets slightly declined by about 1.4%, suggesting limited long-term asset expansion. Total liabilities increased markedly by 37%, from MYR 3,132,227 thousand to MYR 4,292,318 thousand, largely due to a doubling of current liabilities from MYR 1,004,606 thousand to MYR 2,236,716 thousand, while non-current liabilities slightly decreased. Shareholders' equity decreased marginally by 1.9% to MYR 5,331,971 thousand, reflecting the impact of increased liabilities and dividend payments. The current ratio declined from 187.83% to 135.85%, indicating reduced short-term liquidity but still above 1, which suggests the company can meet its short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio rose from 57.63% to 80.50%, signaling higher leverage and a shift towards more debt financing. Overall, the balance sheet shows asset growth and increased leverage with a solid equity base, but liquidity ratios suggest a need for careful monitoring of short-term obligations. | In 2023, the company shows a slightly weakened overall financial position compared to 2022, with total assets decreasing from MYR 8,791,814 thousand to MYR 8,567,093 thousand. This decline is primarily due to a reduction in current assets from MYR 2,463,093 thousand to MYR 1,886,975 thousand, partially offset by an increase in non-current assets from MYR 6,328,721 thousand to MYR 6,680,118 thousand. Total liabilities decreased from MYR 3,482,644 thousand to MYR 3,132,227 thousand, reflecting effective liability management, with both current liabilities and non-current liabilities reduced. Shareholders' equity improved slightly from MYR 5,309,170 thousand to MYR 5,434,866 thousand, supported by stable retained earnings. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 215.22% to 187.83%, indicating a reduction in short-term asset coverage of current liabilities but still maintaining a comfortable liquidity buffer. The debt to equity ratio improved from 65.60% to 57.63%, suggesting a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the balance sheet remains solid with moderate asset growth in long-term assets, reduced liabilities, and a stable equity base, though liquidity has softened somewhat. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue slightly decreased by 1% from MYR 2,966,451 thousand in 2023 to MYR 2,937,875 thousand in 2024, yet gross profit improved by 9.5% to MYR 819,708 thousand due to a reduction in cost of goods sold by 4.5%. This led to an improved gross margin rising from 25.22% to 27.90%. Operating income increased significantly by 25.1% to MYR 560,779 thousand, despite operating expenses rising by 12.8%, resulting in an improved operating margin of 19.09% compared to 15.11% in 2023. Net profit grew by 26% to MYR 334,955 thousand, with net profit margin increasing from 8.96% to 11.40%, reflecting enhanced earnings quality and operational leverage. Return on equity improved from 4.95% to 6.22%, and return on assets increased from 3.06% to 3.68%, indicating better utilization of equity and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate remained stable around 30%, supporting consistent after-tax earnings. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved in 2024, driven by better cost control and margin expansion despite slightly lower revenue. | Profitability in 2023 declined notably compared to 2022. Revenue decreased by approximately 7% from MYR 3,189,782 thousand to MYR 2,966,451 thousand. Cost of goods sold increased slightly, leading to a significant drop in gross profit from MYR 994,640 thousand to MYR 747,995 thousand. Consequently, the gross margin contracted from 31.18% to 25.22%. Operating expenses were slightly reduced, but operating income fell sharply by nearly 40% from MYR 744,614 thousand to MYR 448,177 thousand, causing the operating margin to decline from 23.34% to 15.11%. Net profit halved from MYR 483,331 thousand to MYR 265,788 thousand, with net profit margin dropping from 15.15% to 8.96%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 are 4.95% and 3.06% respectively, indicating modest returns and a decline in earnings quality and sustainability compared to prior year data where these ratios were unavailable. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 30.81%, marginally impacting net profitability. Overall, earnings quality weakened with lower revenue, compressed margins, and reduced profitability ratios. |
| Operational efficiency | The company improved operational efficiency in 2024 as evidenced by a higher operating margin of 19.09% compared to 15.11% in 2023, indicating better cost control relative to revenue. However, asset turnover declined from 34.18% to 32.30%, suggesting a slight decrease in how effectively assets generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased by 24.7% to MYR 494,137 thousand, which may reflect changes in working capital or operational cash flow timing. Inventories increased by 43.7% to MYR 277,352 thousand, which could impact working capital management. The current ratio decreased but remained above 1, indicating adequate liquidity to cover short-term liabilities. Overall, while cost control and operating margins improved, asset utilization and cash flow from operations showed some weakening, highlighting areas for operational focus. | Operational efficiency deteriorated in 2023. The operating margin decreased significantly to 15.11% from 23.34% in 2022, reflecting less effective cost control relative to revenue. Asset turnover for 2023 is 34.18%, indicating the company generated MYR 0.3418 in revenue for every MYR 1 of assets, though no prior year comparison is available. Inventories were reduced substantially from MYR 270,385 thousand to MYR 193,039 thousand, which may indicate improved inventory management or lower production levels. Net cash from operations declined sharply from MYR 958,267 thousand to MYR 656,113 thousand, signaling reduced cash generation from core business activities. Working capital decreased as current assets fell more than current liabilities, consistent with the lower current ratio. Overall, the company experienced reduced operational efficiency with lower margins, diminished cash flow from operations, and tighter working capital management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show increased leverage and liquidity pressures. The debt to equity ratio rose significantly from 57.63% to 80.50%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing and increased financial risk. Current liabilities more than doubled, causing the current ratio to fall from 187.83% to 135.85%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity buffer. Interest expense increased by 15.8% to MYR 123,667 thousand, but interest coverage improved from 419.88% to 453.46%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest costs and manageable interest risk. The effective tax rate remained stable, suggesting no additional tax risk. Overall, the company faces elevated leverage and liquidity risk, but strong interest coverage mitigates immediate solvency concerns. Close monitoring of short-term liabilities and debt levels is advisable. | Financial risk indicators show mixed signals in 2023. Leverage decreased as the debt to equity ratio improved from 65.60% to 57.63%, reducing financial risk related to indebtedness. Liquidity risk increased somewhat as the current ratio declined from 215.22% to 187.83%, indicating less cushion to cover short-term obligations. Interest expense rose from MYR 91,121 thousand to MYR 106,740 thousand, while interest coverage ratio dropped significantly from 817.17% to 419.88%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest costs from operating income, though still at a comfortable level. The effective tax rate increased slightly, which could marginally impact net income sustainability. No other explicit risk factors such as tax rate volatility or unusual financing activities are noted. Overall, the company faces moderate financial risk with improved leverage but reduced liquidity and interest coverage. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show continued capital expenditure with net cash used in investing activities slightly reduced to MYR (376,196) thousand from MYR (408,574) thousand in 2023, indicating sustained but moderated investment. Net cash from financing activities turned positive at MYR 714,808 thousand compared to a large outflow in 2023, suggesting new debt or equity inflows supporting liquidity and growth. The net increase in cash of MYR 832,749 thousand contrasts with a decrease in 2023, enhancing cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments decreased by 22.2% to MYR (188,404) thousand, possibly reflecting a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. Revenue by product shows growth in plantation products and development properties but a decline in palm oil derivative products, indicating shifting product mix. Geographically, revenue from Indonesia increased while Malaysia declined, suggesting growth opportunities in Indonesia. Overall, the company appears positioned for moderate growth with improved cash flow and investment discipline, supported by geographic and product diversification trends. | Investment activities in 2023 remained consistent with prior year, with net cash used in investing activities slightly increasing from MYR (397,402) thousand to MYR (408,574) thousand, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting future growth. Net cash from financing activities showed increased outflows from MYR (615,800) thousand to MYR (776,301) thousand, reflecting higher repayments or dividend distributions. Dividends paid decreased from MYR (305,048) thousand to MYR (242,244) thousand, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue by product shows a decline in palm oil derivative products and plantation products, but growth in development properties and genomics-based products, indicating a potential shift or diversification in revenue streams. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia decreased while Indonesia increased, signaling a possible geographic growth focus in Indonesia. Cash flow sustainability is challenged by lower operational cash inflows and higher financing outflows, which may pressure liquidity if trends continue. Overall, the company appears to be investing for growth with some strategic shifts in product and geographic focus, but must manage cash flow carefully to support future financial performance. |
