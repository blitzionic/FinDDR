# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | GENTING PLANTATIONS BERHAD's revenue shows a declining trend from MYR 3,189,782 thousand in 2022 to MYR 2,966,451 thousand in 2023 and further to MYR 2,937,875 thousand in 2024. Despite this decline, gross profit decreased from MYR 994,640 thousand in 2022 to MYR 747,995 thousand in 2023 but rebounded to MYR 819,708 thousand in 2024. The gross margin percentages reported (31.18% in 2022, 174.78% in 2023, and 172.10% in 2024) appear inconsistent with typical margin calculations, suggesting possible data anomalies or classification differences. Revenue by product/service indicates growth in Plantation revenue from MYR 1,587,654 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,797,913 thousand in 2024, while Downstream Manufacturing revenue declined from MYR 1,512,252 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,008,468 thousand in 2024. Property and AgTech segments show modest increases. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia decreased from MYR 2,006,662 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,495,101 thousand in 2024, whereas Indonesia revenue increased from MYR 1,183,120 thousand to MYR 1,442,774 thousand over the same period, indicating a shift in regional revenue contribution favoring Indonesia. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income declined from MYR 744,614 thousand in 2022 to MYR 448,177 thousand in 2023 but improved to MYR 560,779 thousand in 2024. Correspondingly, the operating margin decreased from 23.34% in 2022 to 15.11% in 2023 before rising to 19.09% in 2024, reflecting improved operational efficiency in 2024 compared to 2023 but still below 2022 levels. Operating expenses increased from MYR 283,128 thousand in 2022 to MYR 299,818 thousand in 2023 and further to MYR 333,086 thousand in 2024, indicating rising cost pressures. Despite revenue declines, the company managed to improve operating income in 2024, suggesting better cost management or operational improvements. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved in 2024 relative to 2023, signaling enhanced profitability from core operations. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable but negative in 2023 and 2024 at (30.81%) and (30.31%) respectively, compared to a positive 29.84% in 2022, indicating tax benefits or credits impacting profitability in the latter years. Income tax expense shifted from a positive MYR 205,542 thousand in 2022 to negative MYR (118,350) thousand in 2023 and MYR (145,713) thousand in 2024, which positively influenced net profit despite declining revenues. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, suggesting that the tax effects are the primary external influence on net profitability during this period. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Genting Plantations Berhad's total assets increased significantly to MYR 9,624,289 thousand from MYR 8,567,093 thousand in 2023, driven primarily by a substantial rise in current assets (MYR 3,038,531 thousand in 2024 vs. MYR 1,886,975 thousand in 2023), while non-current assets slightly decreased. Total liabilities also rose markedly to MYR 4,292,318 thousand from MYR 3,132,227 thousand, with current liabilities more than doubling to MYR 2,236,716 thousand. Shareholders' equity slightly declined to MYR 5,274,978 thousand from MYR 5,334,304 thousand, indicating a modest contraction in net book value. The current ratio decreased from 187.83% to 135.85%, reflecting reduced short-term liquidity but still above 1, suggesting adequate coverage of current liabilities by current assets. The debt to equity ratio increased from 58.72% to 81.37%, indicating a higher leverage and greater reliance on debt financing. Overall, the company shows growth in asset base but with increased liabilities and leverage, suggesting a more aggressive capital structure in 2024. | In 2023, Genting Plantations Berhad's total assets slightly decreased to MYR 8,567,093 thousand from MYR 8,791,814 thousand in 2022, reflecting a modest contraction in asset base. Current assets declined notably from MYR 2,463,093 thousand to MYR 1,886,975 thousand, while non-current assets increased from MYR 6,328,721 thousand to MYR 6,680,118 thousand, indicating a shift towards longer-term asset holdings. Total liabilities decreased from MYR 3,482,644 thousand to MYR 3,132,227 thousand, driven by reductions in both current liabilities (from MYR 1,144,470 thousand to MYR 1,004,606 thousand) and non-current liabilities (from MYR 2,338,174 thousand to MYR 2,127,621 thousand). Shareholders' equity slightly increased to MYR 5,334,304 thousand from MYR 5,309,170 thousand, supported by a marginal rise in retained earnings. The current ratio decreased from 215.22% to 187.83%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity but still maintaining a comfortable buffer above 1. The debt to equity ratio improved from 65.60% to 58.72%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the company maintained solid financial health with a stable equity base, reduced liabilities, and a strong though slightly diminished liquidity position in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue slightly decreased to MYR 2,937,875 thousand in 2024 from MYR 2,966,451 thousand in 2023, a marginal decline. However, gross profit improved to MYR 819,708 thousand from MYR 747,995 thousand, despite a slight decrease in gross margin from 174.78% to 172.10%, indicating better cost of goods sold management. Operating income increased significantly to MYR 560,779 thousand from MYR 448,177 thousand, with operating margin rising from 15.11% to 19.09%, reflecting improved operational profitability. Net profit rose to MYR 334,955 thousand from MYR 265,788 thousand, with net profit margin improving from 8.96% to 11.40%, indicating enhanced bottom-line efficiency. Return on equity increased from 4.99% to 6.31%, and return on assets improved from 3.06% to 3.68%, both signaling better earnings quality and utilization of equity and assets. The effective tax rate remained stable around 30%. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved in 2024 despite slightly lower revenue. | Genting Plantations Berhad experienced a decline in revenue in 2023 to MYR 2,966,451 thousand from MYR 3,189,782 thousand in 2022, a decrease of approximately 7%. Despite this, the gross profit dropped more sharply to MYR 747,995 thousand from MYR 994,640 thousand, reflecting increased cost pressures as cost of goods sold slightly increased to MYR 2,218,456 thousand from MYR 2,195,142 thousand. Gross margin reported an anomalous high figure of 174.78%, likely due to data irregularities or accounting classification, but operating margin declined from 23.34% to 15.11%, and net profit margin halved from 15.15% to 8.96%, indicating reduced profitability and earnings quality. Operating income fell significantly to MYR 448,177 thousand from MYR 744,614 thousand, and net profit dropped to MYR 265,788 thousand from MYR 483,331 thousand. Return on equity and return on assets were 4.99% and 3.06% respectively in 2023, with no comparable 2022 data, showing modest returns on invested capital. The effective tax rate turned negative at -30.81% from 29.84%, suggesting tax benefits or credits impacting net income. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with lower revenue and earnings, compressed margins, and unusual tax and interest expense effects. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost control shows mixed results: cost of goods sold decreased to MYR 2,118,167 thousand from MYR 2,218,456 thousand, supporting gross profit growth, but operating expenses increased to MYR 333,086 thousand from MYR 299,818 thousand, which partially offset operating income gains. Asset turnover declined from 34.18% to 32.30%, indicating slightly less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations slightly decreased to MYR 5,651 thousand from MYR 6,455 thousand, suggesting stable but limited cash generation from core operations. Inventories increased to MYR 277,352 thousand from MYR 193,039 thousand, which may indicate higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Overall, operational efficiency improved in profitability terms but shows some pressure in asset utilization and cash flow generation. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed signals. Cost control was challenged as cost of goods sold increased slightly despite lower revenue, and operating expenses rose to MYR 299,818 thousand from MYR 283,128 thousand, contributing to lower operating income. Asset turnover was reported at 34.18%, a high figure that may reflect data anomalies or specific accounting treatments, but suggests strong utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories decreased significantly from MYR 270,385 thousand to MYR 193,039 thousand, indicating improved inventory management or reduced stock levels. Net cash from operations plunged dramatically to MYR 6,455 thousand from MYR 958,267 thousand in 2022, signaling a severe decline in cash generation from core business activities, which is a critical concern for operational sustainability. Working capital decreased as current assets and current liabilities both declined, with the current ratio falling but remaining above 1. Cash flow from investing turned positive at MYR 408,574 thousand compared to a negative outflow in 2022, possibly reflecting asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. Financing cash flow was strongly positive at MYR 776,301 thousand versus a negative outflow previously, indicating increased borrowing or equity inflows. Overall, operational efficiency weakened in cash generation and cost control, despite some improvements in inventory and asset utilization metrics. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased notably with debt to equity rising to 81.37% from 58.72%, indicating higher financial risk due to increased borrowing. Interest expense rose to MYR 123,667 thousand from MYR 106,740 thousand, but interest coverage improved to 453.46% from 419.88%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest costs and manageable interest burden. The current ratio declined to 135.85% from 187.83%, signaling reduced liquidity but still a comfortable buffer over 1. The effective tax rate remained stable, so no tax risk changes are evident. The increase in current liabilities, more than doubling, could pose short-term liquidity risk if not managed carefully. Overall, financial risk has increased due to higher leverage and liabilities, but strong interest coverage mitigates immediate solvency concerns. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 reveal some early warning signs. The debt to equity ratio improved to 58.72% from 65.60%, reducing leverage risk. However, the interest coverage ratio turned negative at -419.88% from a very strong 817.17% in 2022, indicating that operating income was insufficient to cover interest expenses, possibly due to negative interest expense reported (MYR -106,740 thousand), which may reflect accounting adjustments or interest income exceeding expenses. The effective tax rate was negative at -30.81%, a significant change from 29.84%, which could indicate tax credits or deferred tax assets but also adds complexity to earnings quality assessment. Liquidity, while still adequate with a current ratio of 187.83%, declined from the prior year, suggesting tighter short-term financial flexibility. The drastic drop in net cash from operations to MYR 6,455 thousand raises concerns about cash flow sustainability and potential liquidity stress. These factors combined suggest moderate financial risk with particular attention needed on interest coverage anomalies and operational cash flow weakness. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity, as reflected by net cash from investing, decreased slightly to MYR 376,196 thousand from MYR 408,574 thousand, indicating continued but slightly reduced capital expenditure or asset purchases. Net cash from financing also declined to MYR 714,808 thousand from MYR 776,301 thousand, suggesting moderated financing activities. The net increase in cash improved significantly to MYR 832,749 thousand from MYR 528,762 thousand, enhancing liquidity reserves. Dividends paid decreased to MYR 188,404 thousand from MYR 242,244 thousand, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue by product shows growth in Plantation (MYR 1,797,913 thousand vs. MYR 1,745,185 thousand) and Property (MYR 127,094 thousand vs. MYR 102,003 thousand), while Downstream Manufacturing revenue declined. Geographically, revenue from Indonesia increased, while Malaysia's revenue decreased. These trends suggest future growth focus on Plantation and Property segments and expansion in Indonesia. Cash flow sustainability appears stable with positive operational cash flow and strong cash reserves, supporting ongoing investment and dividend capacity. | Looking ahead, Genting Plantations Berhad's future financial performance may be influenced by several factors observed in 2023. The company generated positive net cash from investing activities (MYR 408,574 thousand), which may indicate asset sales or reduced capital expenditure, potentially limiting growth investments in the near term. The strong positive net cash from financing (MYR 776,301 thousand) suggests increased external funding, which could support future expansion or liquidity needs but may also increase financial obligations. Dividend payments decreased to MYR 242,244 thousand from MYR 305,048 thousand, reflecting a more conservative dividend policy possibly aimed at preserving cash. Revenue by product shows growth in Plantation (MYR 1,745,185 thousand vs. MYR 1,587,654 thousand) and AgTech segments, while Downstream Manufacturing revenue declined, indicating a possible strategic shift or market challenges in certain segments. Geographically, revenue from Indonesia increased to MYR 1,390,317 thousand from MYR 1,183,120 thousand, while Malaysia revenue decreased, suggesting growth opportunities in Indonesia. Given the weak operational cash flow and profitability pressures, sustaining cash flow and managing investments prudently will be critical. The company’s ability to leverage geographic and segment growth while controlling costs and improving cash generation will shape its future financial trajectory. |
