## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

Total liabilities increased moderately by 6.5% to MYR 1,541,047 thousand, driven primarily by a significant rise in current liabilities from MYR 597,156 thousand to MYR 916,083 thousand, partially offset by a reduction in non-current liabilities to MYR 624,964 thousand. Shareholders' equity strengthened by 6.7% to MYR 3,514,033 thousand, supported by a substantial increase in retained earnings to MYR 2,573,545 thousand.

The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 43.85%, indicating consistent leverage management. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth in assets and equity with manageable liabilities, supporting a strong financial foundation in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased modestly by 3.8% to MYR 5,318,342 thousand in 2024 from MYR 5,123,689 thousand in 2023. Cost of goods sold remained nearly flat, resulting in a significant gross profit increase of 26.4% to MYR 940,596 thousand. Despite a slight decrease in gross margin percentage to 182.31% from 185.47%, operating income rose sharply by 44.6% to MYR 584,481 thousand, supported by a reduction in operating expenses. Operating margin improved from 7.89% to 10.99%, reflecting better cost control and operational leverage. Net profit increased by 48.1% to MYR 465,792 thousand, with net profit margin rising to 8.76% from 6.14%, indicating enhanced earnings quality.

Return on equity was 9.23% and return on assets was 6.22%, indicating moderate profitability and earnings sustainability. The effective tax rate slightly increased to 25.28%. Overall, profitability weakened in absolute terms but margins and returns indicate the company maintained reasonable earnings quality despite revenue pressure. |
| Operational efficiency | The company improved operational efficiency in 2024 as evidenced by an increase in asset turnover ratio to 102.04% from 101.39%, indicating slightly better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses decreased to MYR 372,752 thousand from MYR 383,233 thousand, contributing to a higher operating margin. Net cash from operations surged by 78.8% to MYR 658,406 thousand, reflecting strong cash generation capacity and effective working capital management. Inventories increased moderately to MYR 68,012 thousand from MYR 59,065 thousand, which may indicate a buildup to support sales growth. The current ratio's significant improvement to 420.84% suggests strong liquidity and efficient management of current assets and liabilities. Overall, the company demonstrated enhanced cost control, asset utilization, and cash flow generation in 2024. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed results. The operating margin of 7.89% reflects moderate cost control relative to revenue. Asset turnover was very high at 101.39, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations dropped sharply to MYR 368,248 thousand from MYR 746,020 thousand in 2022, indicating reduced cash generation efficiency. Working capital increased as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, but the current ratio declined, signaling tighter short-term liquidity. Inventories remained stable at around MYR 59,065 thousand, indicating consistent inventory management. Overall, while asset utilization remains strong, cash flow from operations and liquidity metrics suggest some operational challenges in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators improved markedly in 2024. The debt-to-equity ratio declined to 32.12% from 43.85%, indicating reduced financial leverage and lower solvency risk. Interest expense decreased substantially to MYR 22,196 thousand from MYR 34,868 thousand, while interest coverage ratio more than doubled to 2633.27% from 1158.79%, reflecting a much stronger ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate remained stable with a slight decrease, reducing tax burden risk. Current liabilities dropped significantly, improving liquidity risk profile. However, net cash used in financing activities increased to MYR (526,900) thousand from MYR (11,609) thousand, which may warrant monitoring for potential financing constraints. Overall, the companyâ€™s financial risk profile improved with lower leverage, stronger interest coverage, and enhanced liquidity in 2024. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show manageable leverage with a stable debt to equity ratio of 43.85%, similar to 2022. However, the increase in current liabilities to MYR 916,083 thousand raises short-term liquidity risk, reflected in the reduced current ratio of 278.74%. Interest expense increased slightly to MYR 34,868 thousand, but interest coverage remains very strong at 1158.79%, indicating ample earnings to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased marginally to 25.28%, which could slightly impact net profitability. The significant decline in net cash from operations and the large negative net cash from investing activities (MYR -832,039 thousand) may pose liquidity and funding risks if sustained. Overall, the company maintains low financial risk but should monitor short-term liquidity and cash flow trends closely. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 showed a reduction in net cash outflow from investing activities to MYR (321,567) thousand compared to MYR (832,039) thousand in 2023, indicating a more conservative or efficient investment approach. Despite this, net cash used in financing activities increased significantly, mainly due to higher dividend payments rising to MYR (151,673) thousand from MYR (53,417) thousand, suggesting a shareholder-friendly dividend policy supported by improved earnings and cash flow. Revenue growth in key segments such as sales of oil palm based products increased by 6.3% to MYR 1,482,259 thousand, while geographic revenue showed a mixed trend with Malaysia and Asia-Pacific regions slightly declining but 'Others' region more than doubling to MYR 541,133 thousand, indicating potential growth opportunities in new or emerging markets. The strong operational cash flow and improved profitability provide a solid foundation for sustainable future performance. Overall, the company appears well-positioned for continued growth with prudent investment, strong cash flow sustainability, and expanding market presence. | Investment activities in 2023 were substantial, with net cash used in investing activities at MYR -832,039 thousand, indicating aggressive capital expenditure or acquisitions that may support future growth. The stable dividend payout of MYR 53,417 thousand suggests a consistent dividend policy despite lower earnings. Revenue by product shows significant sales in oil palm based products at MYR 1,394,895 thousand, while geographic revenue distribution highlights strong presence in Malaysia (MYR 1,843,583 thousand) and Asia-Pacific (MYR 3,044,501 thousand), with smaller contributions from other regions. These geographic and product segment trends suggest focused market strategies that could drive future revenue growth. However, the negative net increase in cash of MYR -475,400 thousand and reduced operational cash flow warrant careful cash flow management to sustain investments and dividends. Overall, the company appears positioned for growth with ongoing investments and stable dividends but must ensure cash flow sustainability. |
