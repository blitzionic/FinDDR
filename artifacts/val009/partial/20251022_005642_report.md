# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue decreased slightly by 3.53% from MYR 5,308,285K to MYR 5,123,689K, then increased by 3.82% to MYR 5,318,342K in 2024, showing a recovery but overall flat growth across the three years. Gross profit declined sharply by 28.98% from MYR 1,048,304K in 2022 to MYR 744,431K in 2023, then rebounded by 26.44% to MYR 940,596K in 2024, indicating volatility in cost control or pricing. Gross margin percentages remained relatively stable but high, fluctuating narrowly between 180.25% and 185.47%, which suggests possible data inconsistency or unusual cost accounting, as gross margin typically does not exceed 100%. Revenue from oil palm based products increased by 6.26% from MYR 1,394,895K in 2023 to MYR 1,482,259K in 2024, indicating growth in this segment. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia decreased by 4.01% from MYR 1,843,583K in 2023 to MYR 1,770,321K in 2024, Asia-Pacific revenue decreased slightly by 1.22% from MYR 3,044,501K to MYR 3,006,888K, while revenue from Others more than doubled from MYR 235,605K to MYR 541,133K, showing a significant shift towards other regions contributing to revenue diversification. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 12.69% in 2022 to 7.89% in 2023, then improved to 10.99% in 2024, reflecting a dip in operational efficiency in 2023 followed by partial recovery. Operating income decreased by 40% from MYR 673,699K in 2022 to MYR 404,048K in 2023, then increased by 44.6% to MYR 584,481K in 2024, mirroring the margin trend. Operating expenses decreased from MYR 419,490K in 2022 to MYR 384,527K in 2023, and further to MYR 373,752K in 2024, indicating effective cost management despite revenue fluctuations. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that while revenue was relatively stable, operating income was more volatile, suggesting operational leverage and sensitivity to cost control. Overall, the company improved cost management in 2024 compared to 2023, but has not yet reached 2022 operating efficiency levels. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable over the three years, with a slight decrease from 24.60% in 2022 to 24.38% in 2024, and a peak at 25.28% in 2023, indicating consistent tax burden without significant changes. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data, suggesting profitability trends are driven by core operations. External factors impacting profitability include the geographic revenue shift with a notable increase in revenue from 'Others' regions, which may reflect market expansion or diversification strategies affecting tax and operational dynamics. The stable but slightly fluctuating tax rate and absence of one-off items imply that external factors had limited disruptive impact on profitability during this period. |
