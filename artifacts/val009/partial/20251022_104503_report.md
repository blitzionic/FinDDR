# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Sarawak Oil Palms Berhad's revenue showed a slight decline from MYR 5,308,285 thousand in 2022 to MYR 5,123,689 thousand in 2023, followed by a recovery to MYR 5,318,342 thousand in 2024. Gross margin remained relatively stable, fluctuating narrowly around 180-185%, with 180.25% in 2022, peaking at 185.47% in 2023, and slightly decreasing to 182.31% in 2024. Revenue by product/service is heavily dominated by oil palm operations, contributing over MYR 5.3 million thousand in 2024, with property development revenue being minimal and declining from MYR 11,992 thousand in 2022 to MYR 5,210 thousand in 2024. Geographically, Asia-Pacific remains the largest revenue source, increasing from MYR 2,910,007 thousand in 2022 to MYR 3,006,888 thousand in 2024, while Malaysia's revenue declined from MYR 1,959,390 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,770,321 thousand in 2024. Revenue from other regions increased notably from MYR 438,888 thousand in 2022 to MYR 541,133 thousand in 2024, indicating some diversification in geographic revenue streams. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 12.69% in 2022 to 7.89% in 2023 but improved to 10.99% in 2024, reflecting a recovery in operational profitability. Operating income followed a similar pattern, decreasing from MYR 673,699 thousand in 2022 to MYR 404,048 thousand in 2023, then rising to MYR 584,481 thousand in 2024, despite relatively stable revenue levels. Operating expenses decreased from MYR 419,490 thousand in 2022 to MYR 373,752 thousand in 2024, indicating effective cost management, although the slight increase from 2023's MYR 384,527 thousand suggests some operational cost pressures in 2024. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved in 2024 compared to 2023, signaling enhanced efficiency in converting revenue into operating profit. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable over the three years, with minor fluctuations: 24.60% in 2022, 25.28% in 2023, and 24.38% in 2024, indicating consistent tax expense management without significant changes impacting net profitability. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, suggesting that the profitability trends are primarily driven by core operational performance rather than one-off events or external shocks. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Sarawak Oil Palms Berhad maintained a stable total asset base at MYR 5,211,209 thousand, slightly lower than 2023's MYR 5,213,241 thousand. Current assets decreased marginally to MYR 2,538,570 thousand from MYR 2,553,534 thousand, while non-current assets increased slightly to MYR 2,672,639 thousand. Total liabilities declined significantly by approximately 20.5% to MYR 1,225,263 thousand from MYR 1,541,047 thousand, driven by a sharp reduction in current liabilities from MYR 916,083 thousand to MYR 603,210 thousand, with non-current liabilities remaining relatively stable. Shareholders' equity improved notably by 8.5% to MYR 3,814,645 thousand, supported by an increase in retained earnings to MYR 2,868,336 thousand. The current ratio improved substantially to 420.84% from 278.74%, indicating enhanced liquidity. The debt-to-equity ratio decreased to 32.12% from 43.85%, reflecting a stronger capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the company exhibits solid financial health with strong equity growth, reduced liabilities, and improved liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, Sarawak Oil Palms Berhad's total assets increased to MYR 5,213,241 thousand from MYR 4,893,976 thousand in 2022, indicating asset growth. Current assets rose significantly to MYR 2,553,534 thousand from MYR 2,182,013 thousand, while non-current assets slightly decreased to MYR 2,659,707 thousand from MYR 2,711,963 thousand. Total liabilities increased moderately to MYR 1,541,047 thousand from MYR 1,446,662 thousand, driven by a notable rise in current liabilities to MYR 916,083 thousand from MYR 597,156 thousand, offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities to MYR 624,964 thousand from MYR 849,506 thousand. Shareholders' equity improved to MYR 3,514,033 thousand from MYR 3,295,111 thousand, supported by higher retained earnings of MYR 2,573,545 thousand versus MYR 2,361,709 thousand. The current ratio declined from 365.40% to 278.74%, reflecting reduced liquidity but still a strong short-term position. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 43.85%, indicating consistent capital structure with moderate leverage. Overall, the company shows solid financial health with asset growth and equity strengthening, though liquidity has softened compared to the prior year. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 3.8% to MYR 5,318,342 thousand in 2024 from MYR 5,123,689 thousand in 2023, primarily driven by oil palm operations despite a slight decline in property development revenue. Gross profit rose significantly by 26.4% to MYR 940,596 thousand, while cost of goods sold remained nearly flat, improving gross profit margin slightly to 182.31% from 185.47% (noting the margin percentages appear unusually high, likely due to multiplier or reporting format). Operating income increased by 44.6% to MYR 584,481 thousand, with operating margin improving to 10.99% from 7.89%. Net profit grew strongly by 48.1% to MYR 465,792 thousand, with net profit margin rising to 8.76% from 6.14%. Return on equity improved to 12.71% from 9.23%, and return on assets increased to 8.94% from 6.22%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 24.38% from 25.28%, contributing to improved net profitability. Interest expense declined by 33.7%, supporting higher income before taxes and net profit. Overall, profitability and earnings quality showed marked improvement in 2024. | Revenue decreased slightly to MYR 5,123,689 thousand in 2023 from MYR 5,308,285 thousand in 2022, a decline of about 3.5%. Cost of goods sold increased to MYR 4,379,258 thousand from MYR 4,259,981 thousand, causing gross profit to fall sharply to MYR 744,431 thousand from MYR 1,048,304 thousand. Despite this, the gross margin improved marginally to 185.47% from 180.25%, suggesting some pricing or cost structure nuances. Operating income dropped significantly to MYR 404,048 thousand from MYR 673,699 thousand, with operating margin declining from 12.69% to 7.89%. Net profit also decreased to MYR 314,372 thousand from MYR 504,250 thousand, with net profit margin falling from 9.50% to 6.14%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 9.23% and 6.22% respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 25.28% from 24.60%. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with lower revenue and profit levels, compressed margins, and reduced earnings quality compared to 2022. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses were controlled effectively, decreasing by 2.8% to MYR 373,752 thousand from MYR 384,527 thousand despite higher revenue, indicating improved cost management. Asset turnover slightly increased to 102.04% from 101.39%, reflecting stable asset utilization. Inventories increased by 17% to MYR 634,596 thousand, which may suggest higher stock levels or preparation for future sales. Net cash from operations surged by 78.8% to MYR 658,406 thousand, demonstrating strong cash generation from core business activities. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased significantly while current assets remained stable, contributing to a higher current ratio. However, net cash used in investing activities decreased substantially to MYR (321,567) thousand from MYR (832,039) thousand, indicating reduced capital expenditure or asset purchases. Net cash used in financing activities increased to MYR (526,900) thousand from MYR (11,609) thousand, largely due to higher dividend payments and possible debt repayments. Overall, operational efficiency improved with better cost control, strong cash flow from operations, and effective working capital management. | Operational efficiency in 2023 shows mixed signals. Cost control appears challenged as cost of goods sold increased despite lower revenue, contributing to reduced gross profit. Operating expenses were reported as a positive MYR 384,527 thousand in 2023 compared to a negative MYR 419,490 thousand in 2022, which may indicate a reporting anomaly or reclassification but suggests a significant change in expense recognition. Asset turnover was strong at 101.39%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Inventories increased to MYR 542,571 thousand from MYR 470,637 thousand, which may imply higher stock levels or slower inventory movement. Net cash from operations declined sharply to MYR 368,248 thousand from MYR 746,020 thousand, reflecting reduced cash generation from core activities. Working capital pressure is evident with current liabilities rising faster than current assets, contributing to a lower current ratio. Cash flow from investing activities turned negative at MYR (832,039) thousand from a positive MYR 5,576 thousand, indicating significant investment outflows. Financing cash outflows decreased to MYR (11,609) thousand from MYR (296,057) thousand. Overall, operational efficiency weakened with lower cash flow generation and increased investment spending, despite strong asset utilization. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage risk decreased in 2024 as evidenced by a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 32.12% compared to 43.85% in 2023, reflecting reduced reliance on debt financing. Interest expense declined by 33.7% to MYR 22,187 thousand, and interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 2634.34% from 1206.55%, indicating a strong ability to meet interest obligations. Liquidity risk is low with a current ratio of 420.84%, up from 278.74%, showing ample short-term asset coverage of liabilities. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 24.38%, which does not indicate increased tax risk. However, the significant increase in dividend payments to MYR 151,673 thousand from MYR 53,417 thousand and the large net cash outflow in financing activities (MYR 526,900 thousand) may pressure cash reserves if not managed prudently. No other explicit financial risks or early warning signs are evident from the data. Overall, financial risk profile improved with lower leverage and strong interest coverage, but cash outflows from financing warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show moderate leverage with a stable debt to equity ratio of 43.85%, similar to 43.90% in 2022. Liquidity risk increased as the current ratio declined from 365.40% to 278.74%, driven by a sharp rise in current liabilities. Interest expense increased slightly to MYR 33,488 thousand from MYR 29,266 thousand, while interest coverage ratio decreased substantially to 1206.55% from 2301.99%, indicating reduced but still very strong ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate rose marginally, which could impact net profitability. The significant negative net cash from investing activities and reduced operational cash flow may pressure liquidity if sustained. No other explicit risk factors are noted in the data. Overall, the company faces moderate financial risk with increased short-term liabilities and lower interest coverage, but maintains strong coverage and manageable leverage. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity in 2024 decreased substantially as net cash used in investing activities fell to MYR (321,567) thousand from MYR (832,039) thousand in 2023, suggesting a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions. The strong net cash from operations of MYR 658,406 thousand supports cash flow sustainability and funds dividend payments, which increased significantly to MYR 151,673 thousand, indicating a shareholder-friendly dividend policy. Revenue growth was modest at 3.8%, with oil palm operations remaining the dominant segment, while property development revenue declined slightly. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia and Asia-Pacific regions decreased slightly, but revenue from 'Others' more than doubled to MYR 541,133 thousand, indicating potential growth opportunities in new markets. The company’s strong liquidity and reduced leverage position it well for future financial stability. However, the reduced investing cash outflow may impact long-term growth if sustained. Overall, the company appears positioned for steady future performance with cautious investment and a focus on cash flow and dividends. | The large negative net cash from investing activities of MYR (832,039) thousand in 2023 suggests substantial investment activity, possibly in fixed assets or expansion, which may support future growth. However, the sharp decline in net cash from operations to MYR 368,248 thousand and the negative net increase in cash of MYR (475,400) thousand raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments decreased to MYR (53,417) thousand from MYR (71,212) thousand, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue by product shows a shift with oil palm operations revenue decreasing slightly to MYR 5,118,073 thousand from MYR 5,296,293 thousand, while property development revenue increased to MYR 5,616 thousand from MYR 11,992 thousand, though still a small portion of total revenue. Geographically, revenue from Asia-Pacific increased to MYR 3,044,501 thousand from MYR 2,910,007 thousand, while Malaysia and Others declined, suggesting regional market shifts. These factors imply that while the company is investing for future growth, it faces near-term cash flow challenges and is adjusting its dividend policy accordingly. The geographic revenue trends may guide strategic focus on Asia-Pacific markets going forward. |
