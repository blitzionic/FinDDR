## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Sarawak Oil Palms Berhad maintained a stable total asset base at MYR 5,211,209 thousand, slightly lower than 2023's MYR 5,213,241 thousand.

Total liabilities decreased significantly by approximately 20.5% to MYR 1,225,263 thousand from MYR 1,541,047 thousand in 2023, driven mainly by a sharp reduction in current liabilities (MYR 603,210 thousand vs. MYR 916,083 thousand), while non-current liabilities remained relatively stable. Shareholders' equity improved notably by 8.5% to MYR 3,814,645 thousand, supported by increased retained earnings (MYR 2,868,336 thousand vs. MYR 2,573,545 thousand). Liquidity strengthened considerably, as reflected by the current ratio rising from 278.74% in 2023 to 420.84% in 2024, indicating enhanced short-term financial health. The capital structure improved with a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 32.12% compared to 43.85% in 2023, signaling reduced leverage and a more conservative financing approach. | In 2023, Sarawak Oil Palms Berhad's total assets increased to MYR 5,213,241 thousand from MYR 4,893,976 thousand in 2022, reflecting asset growth primarily driven by a rise in current assets (MYR 2,553,534 thousand in 2023 vs. MYR 2,182,013 thousand in 2022) despite a slight decline in non-current assets. Total liabilities also increased moderately to MYR 1,541,047 thousand from MYR 1,446,662 thousand, with a notable rise in current liabilities (MYR 916,083 thousand vs. MYR 597,156 thousand) offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities. Shareholders' equity strengthened to MYR 3,514,033 thousand from MYR 3,295,111 thousand, supported by higher retained earnings. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 365.40% to 278.74%, indicating reduced but still strong short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 43.85%, suggesting consistent capital structure with moderate leverage. Overall, the company shows solid financial health with asset growth and equity strengthening, though liquidity has softened compared to the prior year. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company demonstrated strong profitability growth in 2024. Revenue increased by 3.8% to MYR 5,318,342 thousand from MYR 5,123,689 thousand in 2023, primarily driven by higher sales of oil palm based products despite a slight decline in property sales. Gross profit rose significantly by 26.4% to MYR 940,596 thousand, although the gross margin slightly decreased to 182.31% from 185.47%, indicating marginally higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income surged by 44.6% to MYR 584,481 thousand, with operating margin improving from 7.89% to 10.99%, reflecting better cost control and operational leverage. Net profit increased by 48.1% to MYR 465,792 thousand, with net profit margin rising to 8.76% from 6.14%, indicating enhanced earnings quality. Return on equity improved markedly to 12.71% from 9.23%, and return on assets increased to 8.94% from 6.22%, both signaling more efficient use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 24.38% from 25.28%, contributing positively to net profitability. Interest expense declined substantially, improving interest coverage ratio to 2672.89% from 1206.55%, indicating strong earnings relative to interest obligations. | Profitability declined in 2023 compared to 2022. Revenue decreased to MYR 5,123,689 thousand from MYR 5,308,285 thousand, while cost of goods sold increased, resulting in a gross profit drop to MYR 744,431 thousand from MYR 1,048,304 thousand. Gross margin slightly improved to 185.47% from 180.25%, indicating some efficiency in production or pricing despite lower absolute gross profit. Operating income fell sharply to MYR 404,048 thousand from MYR 673,699 thousand, with operating margin declining from 12.69% to 7.89%. Net profit decreased to MYR 314,372 thousand from MYR 504,250 thousand, and net profit margin contracted from 9.50% to 6.14%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 9.23% and 6.22% respectively, providing a measure of moderate profitability and asset utilization. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 25.28% from 24.60%. Overall, earnings quality weakened with lower profits and margins, reflecting pressure on profitability despite stable gross margin percentages. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by several metrics. Cost of goods sold remained nearly flat at MYR 4,377,746 thousand compared to MYR 4,379,258 thousand in 2023, despite revenue growth, contributing to higher gross profit. Operating expenses decreased by 2.9% to MYR 372,752 thousand, reflecting effective cost control. Asset turnover slightly increased to 102.04% from 101.39%, indicating marginally better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations surged by 78.8% to MYR 658,406 thousand, demonstrating strong cash generation capability. Inventories increased by 17% to MYR 634,596 thousand, which may suggest stock buildup or preparation for future sales. Working capital improved significantly, supported by a reduction in current liabilities and stable current assets, enhancing liquidity. Overall, cash flow from operations and working capital management indicate robust operational efficiency and cash flow health. | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2023. Operating expenses decreased to MYR 384,033 thousand from MYR 420,490 thousand, indicating some cost control. However, the increase in cost of goods sold to MYR 4,379,258 thousand from MYR 4,259,981 thousand suggests higher production or input costs. Asset turnover was high at 101.39%, indicating strong revenue generation relative to asset base. Net cash from operations declined significantly to MYR 368,248 thousand from MYR 746,020 thousand, signaling reduced cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased to MYR 542,571 thousand from MYR 470,637 thousand, which may indicate slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. Working capital pressure is evident with current liabilities rising faster than current assets. Cash flow from investing activities was strongly positive at MYR 832,039 thousand compared to a small inflow in 2022, suggesting asset disposals or investment recoveries. Financing cash flow was slightly positive at MYR 11,609 thousand versus a negative outflow previously. Overall, while cost control on operating expenses improved, cash flow from operations weakened and working capital management may require attention. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show a reduced risk profile in 2024. The debt-to-equity ratio declined to 32.12% from 43.85%, indicating lower leverage and reduced financial risk. The current ratio improved substantially to 420.84% from 278.74%, reflecting strong liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense decreased by 34.7% to MYR 21,867 thousand, and interest coverage ratio more than doubled to 2672.89%, signaling a comfortable buffer to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate slightly decreased, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax regulations but does not indicate increased risk. No significant increase in non-current liabilities was observed, remaining stable at MYR 622,053 thousand. Overall, the company exhibits strong liquidity, reduced leverage, and improved interest coverage, suggesting low financial risk and a healthy balance sheet structure. | Financial risk indicators show moderate leverage and liquidity risk in 2023. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at 43.85%, indicating no significant increase in leverage. However, the current ratio declined from 365.40% to 278.74%, reflecting reduced liquidity buffer though still strong. Interest expense increased slightly to MYR 33,488 thousand from MYR 29,266 thousand, while interest coverage ratio decreased substantially from 2301.99% to 1206.55%, indicating a lower but still very comfortable ability to cover interest payments from operating income. The effective tax rate rose marginally to 25.28%, which could impact net profitability. The increase in current liabilities relative to current assets may pose short-term liquidity risk if not managed. No other explicit financial risks such as impairments or unusual expenses are noted. Overall, the company maintains moderate financial risk with stable leverage but should monitor liquidity and interest coverage trends. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Sarawak Oil Palms Berhad's future financial performance appears sustainable and positive. The company invested less in investing activities in 2024 (MYR 321,567 thousand outflow) compared to 2023 (MYR 832,039 thousand outflow), which may indicate a more cautious or efficient capital expenditure approach. Net cash from financing activities increased significantly to MYR 526,900 thousand from MYR 11,609 thousand, possibly reflecting new financing or capital raising to support growth or dividend payments. Dividends paid increased by 70.3% to MYR 151,673 thousand, indicating a shareholder-friendly dividend policy supported by strong earnings and cash flow. Revenue by geographic region shows a shift with decreased sales in Malaysia and Asia-Pacific but a substantial increase in 'Others' region revenue, suggesting geographic diversification. The stable asset base, strong cash flow from operations, improved profitability, and prudent capital management collectively support a positive outlook for continued financial performance and dividend sustainability. | Looking ahead, Sarawak Oil Palms Berhad's future financial performance may be influenced by its investment and cash flow activities in 2023. The company reported a significant positive net cash flow from investing activities of MYR 832,039 thousand, a sharp increase from MYR 5,576 thousand in 2022, which may indicate asset disposals or returns on investments that could support liquidity and reduce debt. Net cash from financing activities was slightly positive at MYR 11,609 thousand, suggesting limited new financing or repayments. Dividend payments increased to MYR 89,030 thousand from MYR 71,212 thousand, reflecting a potentially sustainable or growing dividend policy supported by retained earnings growth. Revenue by product shows a shift with oil palm based products and related income at MYR 5,118,073 thousand and reduced property sales, while geographic revenue indicates growth in Asia-Pacific region offset by declines in Malaysia and others, which may guide strategic focus. Cash flow sustainability appears challenged by lower operational cash generation, so maintaining investment discipline and managing working capital will be critical. Overall, the company is positioned for stable future performance with cautious optimism contingent on operational cash flow recovery and continued prudent investment management. |
