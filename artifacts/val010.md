Gross profit, however, declined from RM5,958 million in 2022 to RM5,215 million in 2023 before rebounding to RM5,523 million in 2024. The gross margin improved from 139.14% in 2022 to 148.77% in 2023 and slightly decreased to 147.58% in 2024, reflecting strong cost control relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service shifted from a detailed breakdown in 2022 (Postpaid RM4,249 million, Prepaid RM2,693 million, Others RM1,266 million, Sale of devices RM1,453 million) to a simplified split in 2023 and 2024 focusing on Telecommunications services and solutions (RM8,378 million in 2023 and RM8,655 million in 2024) and Sale of devices (RM1,608 million in 2023 and RM1,668 million in 2024), showing growth in core telecom services. Geographically, revenue remained predominantly from Malaysia, increasing from RM9,536 million in 2022 to RM9,995 million in 2023 and RM10,316 million in 2024, while revenue from other countries decreased from RM253 million in 2022 to RM185 million in 2023 and slightly increased to RM220 million in 2024, indicating a strong domestic market focus with limited international exposure. |

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Maxis Berhad's total assets slightly decreased to RM22,323 million from RM22,781 million in 2023, driven by reductions in both current assets (RM2,904 million vs. RM3,041 million) and non-current assets (RM19,419 million vs. RM19,740 million). Total liabilities also declined to RM16,417 million from RM17,037 million, with notable decreases in non-current liabilities (RM10,816 million vs. RM11,615 million) despite a slight increase in current liabilities (RM5,601 million vs. RM5,422 million). Shareholders' equity improved to RM5,905 million from RM5,743 million, supported by higher retained earnings (RM3,235 million vs. RM3,093 million). The current ratio decreased to 51.85% from 56.09%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved to 278.02% from 296.66%, reflecting a modest strengthening in capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, Maxis maintains a solid financial position with a balanced capital structure and stable equity base, though liquidity tightened marginally in 2024. | In 2023, Maxis Berhad's total assets slightly decreased to RM22,781 million from RM23,045 million in 2022, driven by a reduction in non-current assets (RM19,740 million vs. RM20,195 million) despite an increase in current assets (RM3,041 million vs. RM2,850 million). Total liabilities increased marginally to RM17,037 million from RM16,954 million, with a notable rise in non-current liabilities (RM11,615 million vs. RM10,848 million) offsetting a decrease in current liabilities (RM5,422 million vs. RM6,106 million). Shareholders' equity declined to RM5,743 million from RM6,089 million, reflecting lower retained earnings (RM3,093 million vs. RM3,432 million). The current ratio improved to 56.09% from 46.68%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio worsened to 296.66% from 278.44%, suggesting increased leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company maintains a solid asset base with improved liquidity but faces higher leverage and slightly reduced equity in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Maxis Berhad demonstrated improved profitability in 2024. Revenue increased by 3.5% to RM10,536 million from RM10,180 million in 2023, driven by growth in both telecommunications services (RM8,655 million vs. RM8,378 million) and device sales (RM1,668 million vs. RM1,608 million). Gross profit rose to RM5,523 million from RM5,215 million, though the gross margin slightly declined to 147.58% from 148.77%. Operating income increased to RM2,758 million from RM2,564 million, lifting the operating margin to 26.18% from 25.19%. Net profit showed a significant improvement, rising 40.7% to RM1,396 million from RM992 million, with net profit margin expanding to 13.25% from 9.74%. Return on equity surged to 23.97% from 16.77%, and return on assets improved to 6.19% from 4.33%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate decreased to 25.63% from 31.30%, contributing to higher net profitability. Overall, Maxis achieved stronger earnings growth and improved margins in 2024, reflecting robust operational performance and tax efficiency. | Maxis Berhad's revenue increased by 4% to RM10,180 million in 2023 from RM9,789 million in 2022, driven primarily by growth in telecommunications services and solutions (RM8,378 million) and sale of devices (RM1,608 million). Despite higher revenue, gross profit declined to RM5,215 million from RM5,958 million, reflecting a significant increase in cost of goods sold (RM4,965 million vs. RM3,831 million). This led to a gross margin improvement to 148.77% from 139.14%, which appears inconsistent with the gross profit decline and may indicate classification or calculation nuances. Operating income improved to RM2,564 million from RM2,209 million, with operating margin rising to 25.19% from 22.57%, indicating better control over operating expenses which decreased substantially to RM880 million from RM1,563 million. Net profit decreased to RM992 million from RM1,151 million, resulting in a lower net profit margin of 9.74% compared to 11.76% in 2022. Return on equity and assets for 2023 were 16.77% and 4.33%, respectively, demonstrating moderate profitability and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate decreased to 31.30% from 36.13%, contributing to earnings quality. Overall, profitability shows mixed signals with revenue growth and operating margin improvement but net profit decline and margin compression. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by better cost control and asset utilization. Cost of goods sold increased marginally to RM5,013 million from RM4,965 million, but operating expenses decreased to RM839 million from RM880 million, indicating tighter expense management. Asset turnover increased to 46.72% from 44.43%, showing more effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations rose to RM3,057 million from RM2,816 million, reflecting strong cash generation capability. Inventories decreased to RM17 million from RM22 million, suggesting efficient inventory management. Despite a slight increase in current liabilities, working capital remained stable. Cash flow from investing activities was less negative at RM(693) million compared to RM(764) million, indicating moderated investment outflows. However, net cash from financing activities was more negative at RM(2,451) million versus RM(2,113) million, driven by dividend payments of RM1,253 million (down from RM1,331 million). Overall, Maxis enhanced operational efficiency through cost discipline, improved asset utilization, and strong operating cash flow generation in 2024. | Operationally, Maxis Berhad improved cost control in 2023 as operating expenses dropped significantly by 44% to RM880 million from RM1,563 million in 2022, enhancing operating income despite higher cost of goods sold. Asset turnover was reported at 44.43%, indicating efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased to RM2,816 million from RM3,303 million, reflecting lower cash generation despite higher revenue, possibly due to working capital changes or increased costs. Inventories increased slightly to RM22 million from RM8 million, but current liabilities decreased, improving the current ratio to 56.09%. Cash flow from investing activities improved, with outflows reducing to RM764 million from RM1,296 million, suggesting more conservative investment spending. Financing cash outflows also decreased to RM2,113 million from RM2,570 million, consistent with lower dividend payments (RM1,331 million vs. RM1,566 million). Overall, the company demonstrated improved cost efficiency and asset utilization but faced reduced operational cash flow generation in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for Maxis in 2024 show a moderate improvement in leverage and liquidity risk. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 278.02% from 296.66%, signaling reduced financial leverage and lower risk exposure. The current ratio declined to 51.85% from 56.09%, indicating a slight tightening in short-term liquidity, which warrants monitoring. Interest expense increased slightly to RM481 million from RM473 million, but interest coverage improved to 573.39% from 542.07%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest obligations and low default risk. The effective tax rate decreased to 25.63% from 31.30%, which may reduce tax-related volatility. No significant changes in other risk factors such as inventory levels or cash flow volatility were observed. Overall, Maxis exhibits manageable financial risk with strong interest coverage and improving leverage, though liquidity ratios suggest a need for continued vigilance. | Financial risk indicators for 2023 show increased leverage with the debt to equity ratio rising to 296.66% from 278.44%, driven by higher non-current liabilities and reduced equity. Despite this, interest coverage improved to 542.07% from 505.49%, indicating strong ability to meet interest obligations despite a slight increase in interest expense (RM473 million vs. RM437 million). The current ratio improved to 56.09% from 46.68%, enhancing short-term liquidity and reducing liquidity risk. The effective tax rate decreased to 31.30% from 36.13%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially impacting future tax liabilities. The net profit margin declined, and net profit decreased, which could signal pressure on earnings quality. The slight decrease in total assets and increase in liabilities suggest cautious monitoring of capital structure is warranted. Overall, while liquidity and interest coverage remain strong, rising leverage and declining profitability present moderate financial risks. |
| Future financial performance projection | Maxis Berhad's future financial performance appears sustainable based on 2024 data. The company maintained positive net cash from operations at RM3,057 million, supporting ongoing operational cash flow sustainability. Investment outflows moderated to RM(693) million, indicating controlled capital expenditure. Financing cash outflows increased to RM(2,451) million, primarily due to dividend payments of RM1,253 million, reflecting a consistent dividend policy with a slight reduction from the prior year. Revenue growth in core telecommunications services and geographic expansion in Malaysia (RM10,316 million vs. RM9,995 million) and other countries (RM220 million vs. RM185 million) suggest potential for continued top-line growth. The improved profitability and strong cash flow generation provide a solid foundation for future investments and shareholder returns. Overall, Maxis is well-positioned for stable financial performance with prudent investment and dividend strategies supporting growth and shareholder value. | Looking ahead, Maxis Berhad's reduced investing cash outflows (RM764 million vs. RM1,296 million) suggest a more conservative investment approach in 2023, which may limit growth but preserve cash. The company maintained dividend payments at RM1,331 million, slightly lower than 2022, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns but with some moderation. Revenue growth in telecommunications services and solutions, particularly in Malaysia (RM9,995 million vs. RM9,536 million), remains a key driver, while international revenue declined (RM185 million vs. RM253 million), signaling geographic concentration risk. The improved operating margin and asset turnover imply potential for operational leverage to support future profitability. However, increased leverage and reduced net profit margin may constrain financial flexibility. Sustained positive cash flow from operations, though lower than prior year, supports dividend sustainability. Overall, Maxis Berhad appears positioned for stable but cautious financial performance with focus on core domestic markets and disciplined capital allocation. |
