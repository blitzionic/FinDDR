# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased steadily from RM9,789 million in 2022 to RM10,180 million in 2023 (3.98% growth), and further to RM10,536 million in 2024 (3.53% growth). Gross profit was RM6,143 million in 2023 and slightly declined to RM5,901 million in 2024, despite revenue growth, indicating a decrease in gross margin from 139.66% in 2023 to 143.90% in 2024. The unusually high gross margin percentages suggest possible accounting or classification nuances but show a positive trend. Revenue by product/service shows postpaid revenue grew from RM4,249 million in 2022 to RM4,690 million in 2024 (10.3% increase), while prepaid revenue declined from RM2,693 million to RM2,565 million (4.7% decrease). Sales of devices increased from RM1,453 million to RM1,668 million (14.8% increase), and 'others' category also rose modestly. Geographically, Malaysia remains the dominant market, with revenue increasing from RM9,536 million in 2022 to RM10,316 million in 2024 (8.2% growth), while revenue from other countries decreased from RM253 million to RM220 million (13.0% decline), indicating a concentration of revenue growth in the domestic market. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin slightly declined from 19.03% in 2023 to 18.13% in 2024, reflecting a marginal decrease in operating efficiency. Operating income decreased from RM1,937 million in 2023 to RM1,910 million in 2024 despite revenue growth, indicating that operating expenses were managed but not sufficiently to improve operating income. Operating expenses decreased from RM3,206 million in 2023 to RM2,991 million in 2024 (6.7% reduction), showing effective cost management. The relationship between operating income and revenue suggests the company maintained stable operational profitability, but the slight margin decline signals potential pressure on cost structure or pricing. Overall, the company demonstrated moderate improvement in cost control but faced challenges in converting revenue growth into higher operating profits. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate improved significantly from 36.13% in 2022 to 31.30% in 2023 and further to 25.63% in 2024, reducing the tax burden and positively impacting net profitability. Income tax expense decreased from RM651 million in 2022 to RM452 million in 2023 and RM481 million in 2024, despite rising pre-tax income, indicating favorable tax conditions or tax planning. Net profit margin improved from 9.74% in 2023 to 13.25% in 2024, supported by lower tax rates and stable operating income. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are noted in the data. External factors such as tax rate reductions appear to have materially enhanced net profitability, offsetting some operational margin pressures. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a slightly weakened overall financial position compared to 2023, with total assets decreasing from RM22,781 million to RM22,323 million. Both current and non-current assets declined, indicating a modest contraction in asset base. Total liabilities also decreased from RM17,037 million to RM16,417 million, reflecting effective liability management and a reduction in financial obligations. Shareholders' equity improved from RM5,743 million to RM5,905 million, supported by increased retained earnings (RM3,235 million in 2024 vs RM3,093 million in 2023), which strengthens the equity base. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 56.09% to 51.85%, suggesting a slight reduction in short-term liquidity but still maintaining a reasonable buffer. The debt to equity ratio improved from 296.66% to 278.02%, indicating a more balanced capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a stable financial health with prudent liability management and modest equity growth despite a slight asset contraction. | In 2023, the company’s total assets slightly decreased to RM22,781 million from RM23,045 million in 2022, indicating a marginal contraction in asset base. Current assets increased from RM2,781 million to RM3,041 million, improving liquidity, while non-current assets declined from RM20,264 million to RM19,740 million, suggesting possible asset disposals or depreciation. Total liabilities rose slightly from RM16,954 million to RM17,037 million, driven by an increase in current liabilities from RM4,812 million to RM5,422 million, partially offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities from RM12,142 million to RM11,615 million. Shareholders' equity decreased from RM6,089 million to RM5,743 million, reflecting lower retained earnings and net profit. The current ratio declined slightly from 57.79% to 56.09%, indicating a minor weakening in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased from 278.44% to 296.66%, signaling higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company maintains a strong asset base but faces pressure from increased leverage and reduced equity, with liquidity remaining adequate but slightly weakened compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased moderately by 3.5% from RM10,180 million in 2023 to RM10,536 million in 2024. However, gross profit declined from RM6,143 million to RM5,901 million, resulting in a decrease in gross profit in absolute terms but an increase in gross margin from 139.66% to 143.90%, indicating improved cost efficiency relative to revenue. Operating income slightly decreased from RM1,937 million to RM1,910 million, causing the operating margin to decline from 19.03% to 18.13%. Despite this, net profit rose significantly by 40.7% from RM992 million to RM1,396 million, driving the net profit margin higher from 9.74% to 13.25%. This improvement is supported by higher income before taxes (RM1,877 million vs RM1,444 million) and a lower effective tax rate (25.63% vs 31.30%), enhancing earnings quality and sustainability. Return on equity increased markedly from 16.77% to 23.97%, and return on assets improved from 4.33% to 6.19%, reflecting stronger profitability and efficient use of equity and assets. Overall, the company demonstrates improved bottom-line profitability and earnings quality despite some pressure on operating income. | Revenue increased by 4% from RM9,789 million in 2022 to RM10,180 million in 2023, driven primarily by growth in postpaid and sale of devices segments. Gross profit for 2023 was RM6,143 million, yielding an exceptionally high gross margin of 139.66%, which is unusually elevated and may reflect accounting or classification nuances. Operating income stood at RM1,937 million with an operating margin of 19.03%, indicating effective control over operating expenses (RM3,206 million). However, net profit declined by 13.8% from RM1,151 million in 2022 to RM992 million in 2023, resulting in a lower net profit margin of 9.74% compared to 11.76% in 2022. The decline in net profit despite revenue growth suggests increased interest expenses (RM473 million) and lower income before taxes (RM1,444 million vs. RM1,802 million). Return on equity was 16.77% and return on assets 4.33%, reflecting moderate profitability and earnings sustainability amid higher leverage and reduced net income. The effective tax rate decreased from 36.13% to 31.30%, slightly improving after-tax profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses decreased from RM3,206 million in 2023 to RM2,991 million in 2024, indicating effective cost control efforts. The operating margin, however, slightly declined to 18.13% from 19.03%, suggesting that cost savings were not fully sufficient to offset the decline in gross profit. Asset turnover improved from 44.43% to 46.72%, showing enhanced efficiency in generating revenue from assets. Net cash from operations increased by 8.5% from RM2,816 million to RM3,057 million, reflecting strong operational cash flow generation. Inventories decreased marginally from RM22 million to RM17 million, indicating tighter inventory management. Working capital dynamics show a slight increase in current liabilities (RM5,601 million vs RM5,422 million) and a decrease in current assets (RM2,904 million vs RM3,041 million), which may pressure short-term liquidity but is offset by strong operating cash flows. Overall, operational efficiency improved through better asset utilization and cost control, supported by robust cash flow from operations. | The company demonstrated solid operational efficiency in 2023 with an operating margin of 19.03%, indicating effective cost control relative to revenue. Operating expenses were RM3,206 million against a gross profit of RM6,143 million, showing disciplined expense management. Asset turnover was notably high at 44.43, suggesting very efficient use of assets to generate revenue, although this figure is unusually large and may reflect specific accounting treatments. Net cash from operations decreased from RM3,303 million in 2022 to RM2,816 million in 2023, indicating a reduction in cash generation despite higher revenue. Working capital dynamics show an increase in current liabilities and current assets, with inventories rising slightly from RM8 million to RM22 million, which remains minimal. Overall, the company maintains strong operational efficiency but faces some pressure on cash flow generation. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators show improvement with the debt to equity ratio declining from 296.66% to 278.02%, reducing financial risk. However, the current ratio decreased from 56.09% to 51.85%, signaling a slight weakening in liquidity position that warrants monitoring. Interest expense increased slightly from RM473 million to RM481 million, while interest coverage ratio marginally declined from 409.51% to 397.09%, still indicating strong ability to cover interest obligations comfortably. The effective tax rate decreased from 31.30% to 25.63%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially impacting future tax liabilities. No significant increase in short-term liabilities was observed, but the slight rise in current liabilities alongside reduced current assets suggests some liquidity risk. Overall, financial risk remains moderate with improved leverage but a need to watch liquidity and tax rate changes. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 highlight increased leverage and liquidity pressures. The debt to equity ratio rose to 296.66% from 278.44% in 2022, reflecting higher reliance on debt financing relative to equity. The current ratio declined slightly to 56.09%, indicating a modest reduction in short-term liquidity buffer. Interest expense was significant at RM473 million, and the interest coverage ratio is reported as (409.51%), which appears negative or anomalous, suggesting potential issues in covering interest costs from operating income or a data irregularity. The effective tax rate decreased, which may reduce tax-related risks. Overall, the company faces elevated financial risk due to increased leverage and marginally weaker liquidity, warranting close monitoring of debt servicing capacity and cash flow adequacy. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a reduction in net cash used in investing from RM764 million in 2023 to RM693 million in 2024, indicating a slight moderation in capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow from RM2,113 million to RM2,451 million, driven partly by dividend payments which decreased slightly from RM1,331 million to RM1,253 million, suggesting a stable dividend policy with slight cash conservation. Revenue growth in key segments such as postpaid (RM4,690 million vs RM4,463 million) and others (RM1,400 million vs RM1,296 million) indicates positive market trends, especially in Malaysia where revenue increased from RM9,995 million to RM10,316 million, showing strong domestic market performance. The increase in net cash from operations and improved profitability metrics support sustainable cash flow generation for future growth. Overall, the company is positioned for steady future financial performance with controlled investment spending, consistent dividend policy, and growth in core markets. | Investment activities in 2023 show reduced cash outflows from investing at RM764 million compared to RM1,296 million in 2022, indicating a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities also decreased to an outflow of RM2,113 million from RM2,570 million, with dividends paid reduced from RM1,566 million to RM1,331 million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy and possible deleveraging efforts. Revenue growth in key segments such as postpaid and sale of devices, along with stable geographic concentration in Malaysia (RM9,995 million), indicates continued market strength domestically despite a decline in other countries' revenue. The sustainability of cash flows is challenged by lower net cash from operations and increased leverage, but the company’s focus on controlling investing and financing outflows may support future financial stability. Overall, the company appears to be cautiously managing growth and capital allocation to sustain future performance. |
