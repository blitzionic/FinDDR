# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased steadily from RM9,789 million in 2022 to RM10,180 million in 2023 (3.98% growth), and further to RM10,536 million in 2024 (3.53% growth). Gross profit data is only available for 2023 and 2024, showing a decline from RM6,196 million in 2023 to RM5,513 million in 2024, despite revenue growth, indicating rising direct costs. Gross margin improved from 139.14% in 2023 to 147.67% in 2024, which appears inconsistent with the gross profit decline and may suggest data anomalies or accounting treatments. Revenue by product/service shows that postpaid telecommunications services grew from RM4,463 million in 2023 to RM4,690 million in 2024 (+5.06%), while prepaid services declined from RM2,619 million to RM2,565 million (-2.06%). Other telecommunications services increased by 8.02% (RM1,296 million to RM1,400 million), and device sales slightly increased by 3.73% (RM1,608 million to RM1,668 million). Geographically, revenue is heavily concentrated in Malaysia, increasing from RM9,995 million in 2023 to RM10,316 million in 2024 (+3.19%), with minor growth in other countries from RM185 million to RM220 million (+18.92%), indicating stable domestic market dominance with modest international expansion. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 34.02% in 2023 to 26.21% in 2024, despite revenue growth, reflecting reduced operational efficiency. Operating income decreased from RM3,463 million in 2023 to RM2,761 million in 2024 (-20.28%), while revenue increased by 3.53%, indicating that operating expenses or cost pressures increased disproportionately. Operating expenses remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from RM2,733 million in 2023 to RM2,752 million in 2024 (+0.7%), suggesting that the decline in operating income is more likely due to increased cost of goods sold or other operational inefficiencies rather than overhead cost increases. The operating income to revenue ratio deterioration highlights challenges in cost management and margin preservation amid revenue growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate improved (decreased) from 36.13% in 2022 to 31.30% in 2023 and further to 25.63% in 2024, reducing tax burden and positively impacting net profitability. Income tax expense decreased from RM651 million in 2022 to RM452 million in 2023 and slightly increased to RM481 million in 2024, consistent with net profit trends. Net profit margin improved from 9.74% in 2023 to 13.25% in 2024, despite lower operating margin, indicating tax efficiency gains or other non-operating income effects. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors such as stable domestic revenue and modest international growth suggest limited external shocks, but the decline in operating margin may reflect competitive pressures or cost inflation impacting profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a slightly weakened overall financial position with total assets decreasing from RM22,781 million in 2023 to RM22,323 million. Both current and non-current assets declined, indicating a modest contraction in asset base. Total liabilities also decreased from RM17,037 million to RM16,417 million, reflecting effective liability management and a reduction in financial obligations. Shareholders' equity improved from RM5,743 million to RM5,905 million, supported by increased retained earnings from RM3,093 million to RM3,235 million, strengthening the equity base. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 56.09% to 51.85%, suggesting a slight reduction in short-term liquidity but still maintaining a reasonable buffer. The debt to equity ratio improved from 296.66% to 278.02%, indicating a more balanced capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a stable but slightly conservative financial health with controlled liabilities and modest equity growth. | In 2023, the company’s total assets slightly decreased to RM22,781 million from RM23,045 million in 2022, indicating a minor contraction in asset base primarily due to a reduction in non-current assets (RM19,740 million in 2023 vs RM20,264 million in 2022). Current assets increased to RM3,041 million from RM2,781 million, reflecting improved short-term asset liquidity. Total liabilities marginally increased to RM17,037 million from RM16,954 million, driven by a rise in current liabilities (RM5,422 million vs RM4,812 million) despite a decrease in non-current liabilities (RM11,615 million vs RM12,142 million). Shareholders’ equity declined to RM5,743 million from RM6,089 million, with retained earnings also falling to RM3,093 million from RM3,432 million, indicating some erosion in net worth. The current ratio slightly decreased to 56.09% from 57.79%, suggesting a stable but slightly weaker liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio increased to 296.66% from 278.44%, signaling higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company maintains a solid financial position with stable liquidity but shows signs of increased leverage and a slight decline in equity base in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased modestly by 3.5% from RM10,180 million in 2023 to RM10,536 million in 2024. However, gross profit declined from RM6,196 million to RM5,513 million, driven by a significant rise in cost of goods sold from RM3,984 million to RM5,023 million, which compressed gross profit margins. Despite this, the gross margin percentage improved from 139.14% to 147.67%, indicating possible changes in revenue recognition or cost classification. Operating income decreased from RM3,463 million to RM2,761 million, with operating margin falling from 34.02% to 26.21%, reflecting higher operating expenses relative to revenue. Net profit increased substantially from RM992 million to RM1,396 million, lifting net profit margin from 9.74% to 13.25%, supported by lower effective tax rate (from 31.30% to 25.63%) and higher income before taxes. Return on equity improved markedly from 16.77% to 23.97%, and return on assets rose from 4.33% to 6.19%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and better utilization of equity and assets. Overall, profitability shows mixed trends with margin pressure at gross and operating levels but strong net earnings growth and improved returns. | Revenue grew by 4.0% to RM10,180 million in 2023 from RM9,789 million in 2022, reflecting moderate top-line growth. Gross profit for 2023 was RM6,196 million with a gross margin of 139.14%, an unusually high figure likely due to accounting or classification specifics, but indicating strong revenue over cost of goods sold. Operating income nearly doubled to RM3,463 million from RM1,802 million, improving the operating margin significantly to 34.02% from 18.41%, demonstrating enhanced operational profitability and cost control. However, net profit declined to RM992 million from RM1,151 million, reducing the net profit margin to 9.74% from 11.76%, primarily due to higher interest expenses (RM473 million vs RM437 million) and lower income before taxes (RM1,444 million vs RM1,802 million). The effective tax rate improved to 31.30% from 36.13%, partially offsetting profit pressures. Return on equity stood at 16.77% and return on assets at 4.33%, indicating reasonable earnings quality and moderate asset efficiency. Overall, profitability improved at the operating level but net earnings were pressured by financing costs and tax impacts, suggesting mixed earnings sustainability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased slightly from RM2,733 million to RM2,752 million, while revenue grew modestly, resulting in a reduced operating margin from 34.02% to 26.21%, indicating some erosion in cost control efficiency. Asset turnover improved from 44.43% to 46.72%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased from RM2,816 million to RM3,057 million, demonstrating strong cash generation capability. Inventories decreased from RM22 million to RM17 million, suggesting improved inventory management. However, the current ratio declined from 56.09% to 51.85%, indicating a slight tightening in working capital liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency shows positive trends in asset utilization and cash flow generation, though cost control and working capital management require attention. | The company demonstrated improved operational efficiency in 2023, with operating expenses controlled at RM2,733 million relative to revenue of RM10,180 million, supporting a strong operating margin of 34.02%. Asset turnover was 44.43%, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased to RM2,816 million from RM3,303 million in 2022, reflecting some reduction in cash generation despite higher revenue, which may be due to working capital changes or timing differences. Inventories increased slightly to RM22 million from RM8 million, but remain low relative to total assets, indicating efficient inventory management. The current ratio of 56.09% suggests adequate short-term liquidity to cover current liabilities. Overall, the company shows good cost control and asset utilization but a slight decline in operational cash flow generation warrants monitoring. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators improved with debt to equity ratio decreasing from 296.66% to 278.02%, signaling reduced financial risk from lower relative debt levels. Interest expense increased slightly from RM473 million to RM481 million, but interest coverage ratio declined from 732.14% to 574.01%, still indicating a very strong ability to cover interest obligations comfortably. The effective tax rate decreased from 31.30% to 25.63%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax regulations, potentially impacting future tax liabilities. Current liabilities increased slightly from RM5,422 million to RM5,601 million, while current assets decreased, contributing to a lower current ratio and indicating some liquidity risk. Overall, financial risk remains moderate with strong interest coverage and improving leverage, but liquidity and tax rate changes warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 highlight increased leverage and liquidity pressures. The debt to equity ratio rose to 296.66% from 278.44%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Current liabilities increased while current assets grew modestly, resulting in a slight decline in the current ratio to 56.09%, which may constrain short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased to RM473 million from RM437 million, but interest coverage improved substantially to 732.14% from 412.36%, suggesting the company’s operating income comfortably covers interest obligations despite higher debt levels. The effective tax rate decreased to 31.30% from 36.13%, reducing tax burden risk. No significant changes in non-current liabilities or other risk factors were noted. Overall, while leverage has increased, strong interest coverage and stable liquidity mitigate immediate financial distress risk, but the company should monitor debt levels closely. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a reduction in net cash used in investing from RM764 million in 2023 to RM693 million in 2024, suggesting a slight moderation in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow from RM2,113 million to RM2,451 million, with dividends paid decreasing from RM1,331 million to RM1,253 million, indicating a stable but slightly reduced dividend policy. Revenue growth is driven primarily by the Malaysian market, increasing from RM9,995 million to RM10,316 million, while other countries' revenue also rose from RM185 million to RM220 million, signaling geographic expansion. Product-wise, postpaid and device sales revenues increased, while prepaid revenue slightly declined, indicating shifting market dynamics. The strong operational cash flow and improving returns suggest sustainable cash flow generation to support future growth. Overall, the company appears positioned for moderate growth with stable dividend payouts and cautious investment spending. | Investment activities in 2023 show reduced cash outflows from investing at RM764 million compared to RM1,296 million in 2022, indicating a potential slowdown or more selective capital expenditure. Net cash from financing activities also decreased to RM(2,113) million from RM(2,570) million, with dividends paid down to RM1,331 million from RM1,566 million, suggesting a slightly more conservative dividend policy and financing approach. Revenue concentration remains heavily weighted towards Malaysia (RM9,995 million of RM10,180 million total), with minimal contribution from other countries (RM185 million), indicating limited geographic diversification. Product revenue is diversified within telecommunications services and device sales, with postpaid services leading at RM4,463 million. The company’s ability to sustain cash flows from operations (RM2,816 million) above dividend payments and reduced investing outflows supports future financial stability. However, the slight decline in net profit and equity base, combined with increased leverage, suggests cautious growth prospects. Continued focus on operational efficiency and selective investment will be critical for future performance. |
