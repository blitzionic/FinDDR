# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased steadily from RM9,789 million in 2022 to RM10,180 million in 2023 (+4.0%) and further to RM10,536 million in 2024 (+3.5%). Despite this growth, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) rose significantly from RM3,831 million in 2022 to RM4,930 million in 2023 (+28.7%) and RM5,013 million in 2024 (+1.7%), which compressed gross profit from RM5,958 million in 2022 to RM5,250 million in 2023 (-11.9%) before recovering to RM5,523 million in 2024 (+5.2%). Gross margin percentages show an unusual pattern with 139.14% in 2022, increasing to 148.43% in 2023 and slightly decreasing to 147.58% in 2024, indicating possible data inconsistency or accounting adjustments but generally reflecting strong gross profitability. Revenue by product/service reveals that postpaid telecommunications services grew from RM4,249 million in 2022 to RM4,690 million in 2024 (+10.4%), while prepaid services declined from RM2,693 million to RM2,565 million (-4.7%). Other telecommunications services increased modestly from RM1,266 million to RM1,400 million (+10.6%), and device sales rose from RM1,453 million to RM1,668 million (+14.8%). Geographically, Malaysia dominates revenue, increasing from RM9,536 million in 2022 to RM10,316 million in 2024 (+8.2%), while revenue from other countries decreased from RM253 million to RM220 million (-13.0%), indicating a stronger domestic market focus. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income showed a mixed trend, decreasing from RM2,209 million in 2022 to RM2,064 million in 2023 (-6.6%) before rebounding to RM2,763 million in 2024 (+33.9%). Operating margin followed a similar pattern, declining from 22.57% in 2022 to 20.28% in 2023, then improving significantly to 26.22% in 2024, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency in the latest year. Operating expenses remained relatively stable, slightly increasing from RM813 million in 2022 to RM880 million in 2023 (+8.2%) but decreasing to RM839 million in 2024 (-4.7%), indicating effective cost management in 2024. The relationship between operating income and revenue improved notably in 2024, with operating income representing 26.22% of revenue compared to 20.28% in 2023, suggesting better control over costs and/or improved pricing or product mix. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased consistently from 36.13% in 2022 to 31.30% in 2023 and further to 25.63% in 2024, which positively impacted net profitability by reducing tax expenses relative to pre-tax income. Income tax expense declined from RM651 million in 2022 to RM452 million in 2023 and RM481 million in 2024, despite rising operating income, reflecting the lower tax rate. Net profit margin improved from 9.74% in 2023 to 13.25% in 2024, aided by both operational improvements and tax rate reductions. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the data provided.

Overall, 2024 shows improved profitability and earnings sustainability with stronger margins and returns. | Revenue increased to RM10,180 million in 2023 from RM9,789 million in 2022, showing growth in top-line performance. However, gross profit declined to RM5,250 million from RM5,958 million, despite an improved gross margin percentage (148.43% in 2023 vs. 139.14% in 2022), indicating cost of goods sold increased disproportionately (RM4,930 million vs. RM3,831 million). Operating income decreased to RM2,064 million from RM2,209 million, with operating margin declining to 20.28% from 22.57%, reflecting higher operating expenses (RM880 million vs. RM813 million).

Overall, the company demonstrates improved operational efficiency through higher margins, better asset utilization, and stronger operating cash flows in 2024. | Operating expenses increased to RM880 million from RM813 million, contributing to a reduced operating margin of 20.28% in 2023 from 22.57% in 2022, indicating some erosion in cost control efficiency. Asset turnover was reported at 44.43% in 2023 (not available in 2022), reflecting moderate utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased to RM2,816 million from RM3,303 million, signaling reduced cash generation efficiency. Inventories increased slightly to RM22 million from RM8 million, which may indicate higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Working capital dynamics show current assets rising to RM3,041 million and current liabilities increasing to RM5,422 million, resulting in a current ratio decline to 56.09%, suggesting tighter short-term liquidity management. Overall, operational efficiency shows some weakening in cost control and cash flow generation, with moderate asset utilization. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show improvement in 2024. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 296.66% to 278.02%, indicating reduced leverage and a stronger equity cushion. Interest expense slightly increased from RM473 million to RM481 million, but interest coverage ratio improved significantly from 436.36% to 574.43%, reflecting enhanced ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The current ratio declined from 56.09% to 51.85%, signaling a slight reduction in liquidity and potential short-term risk. The effective tax rate decreased from 31.30% to 25.63%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially impacting future tax liabilities. Overall, leverage and interest coverage trends suggest reduced financial risk, but liquidity tightening warrants attention. | Leverage remains high with a debt to equity ratio of 296.66% in 2023, slightly up from 294.86% in 2022, indicating continued reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased to RM473 million from RM437 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased to 436.36% from 505.49%, reflecting a slight reduction in the company’s ability to cover interest obligations from operating income. The current ratio decreased marginally to 56.09%, indicating a modest decline in liquidity. The effective tax rate improved to 31.30% from 36.13%, reducing tax-related risk. No significant changes in other risk indicators are noted. Overall, the company faces moderate financial risk with high leverage and slightly reduced interest coverage, but maintains adequate liquidity and tax efficiency. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a slight reduction in net cash used for investing from RM764 million to RM693 million, indicating continued but moderated capital expenditure or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow from RM2,113 million to RM2,451 million, consistent with dividend payments of RM1,253.2 million (down from RM1,331 million), suggesting a stable dividend policy with slight reduction in payout. Revenue growth in key segments such as telecommunications postpaid (RM4,690 million vs RM4,463 million) and others (RM1,400 million vs RM1,296 million) indicates positive market trends, while prepaid revenue slightly declined. Geographic revenue growth in Malaysia from RM9,995 million to RM10,316 million and other countries from RM185 million to RM220 million suggests expanding market presence. The strong operating cash flow and improved profitability support sustainable future performance. Overall, the company is positioned for moderate growth with stable dividend policy and prudent investment spending in 2024. | Investment activities show a reduced net cash outflow from investing at RM764 million in 2023 compared to RM1,296 million in 2022, indicating a moderation in capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing activities also decreased in outflow to RM2,113 million from RM2,570 million, consistent with lower dividend payments (RM1,331 million vs. RM1,566 million), suggesting a more conservative dividend policy or cash retention strategy. Revenue growth in key segments such as telecommunications services - postpaid increased to RM4,463 million from RM4,249 million, and sale of devices rose to RM1,608 million from RM1,453 million, indicating positive market demand trends. However, revenue from prepaid services and other countries declined, signaling potential geographic and segment challenges. The slight decrease in cash balance (net decrease of RM61 million) suggests cash flow sustainability is under pressure but stable. Overall, the company appears to be moderating investment and financing outflows while focusing on growth in core segments, supporting a cautiously optimistic future financial outlook. |
