## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Maxis Berhad's revenue showed a steady increase from RM9,789 million in 2022 to RM10,180 million in 2023, and further to RM10,536 million in 2024, indicating consistent top-line growth.

Revenue by product/service highlights a dominant contribution from service revenue, growing from RM8.336 billion in 2022 to RM8.572 billion in 2023 and RM8.87 billion in 2024, while device revenue was RM1.61 billion in 2023 and increased to RM1.67 billion in 2024.

Enterprise segment revenue also grew from RM1.51 billion in 2023 to RM1.61 billion in 2024, with fixed & solutions and mobile sub-segments contributing RM783 million and RM827 million respectively in 2024. Geographically, revenue is heavily concentrated in Malaysia, increasing from RM9,536 million in 2022 to RM10,316 million in 2024, while revenue from other countries declined from RM253 million in 2022 to RM220 million in 2024, indicating a strong domestic market focus. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a dip in 2023 to 18.57% from 22.57% in 2022 but recovered to 22.06% in 2024, reflecting some volatility but overall stable operating profitability.

Operating expenses fluctuated significantly, rising sharply to RM3,323 million in 2023 from RM1,470 million in 2022, then decreasing to RM2,477 million in 2024, suggesting cost management challenges in 2023 followed by effective expense control in 2024. The reduction in operating expenses in 2024 contributed to the improved operating income and margin despite higher revenue, highlighting enhanced operational efficiency and cost discipline in the latest year. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate declined consistently from 36.13% in 2022 to 31.30% in 2023 and further to 25.63% in 2024, which positively impacted net profitability by reducing tax expenses relative to pre-tax income.

| Profitability and earnings quality | Maxis Berhad demonstrated improved profitability in 2024. Revenue increased by 3.5% to RM10,536 million from RM10,180 million in 2023, driven by growth in both service revenue (RM8.87 billion vs RM8.572 billion) and device revenue (RM1.67 billion vs RM1.61 billion).

Gross profit improved slightly to RM5,213 million from RM5,179 million, with gross margin increasing to 148.79% from 147.09%, indicating stable cost of goods sold relative to revenue. However, operating income declined to RM1,890 million from RM2,209 million, and operating margin decreased to 18.57% from 22.57%, reflecting higher operating expenses (RM3,323 million vs. RM1,470 million).

Income before taxes decreased to RM1,444 million from RM1,802 million, and the effective tax rate improved (lowered) to 31.30% from 36.13%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 16.77% and 4.33%, respectively, indicating moderate profitability and efficient use of equity and assets despite margin compression. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by better cost control and asset utilization. Operating expenses were reduced by approximately 25% to RM2,477 million from RM3,323 million, enhancing operating income despite only a modest revenue increase. Asset turnover increased to 46.72% from 44.43%, indicating more effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations rose to RM3,057 million from RM2,816 million, reflecting stronger cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased slightly to RM17 million from RM22 million, suggesting efficient inventory management. However, the current ratio declined to 51.85%, signaling tighter liquidity. Overall, Maxis improved operational efficiency through cost discipline and better asset utilization, supporting stronger cash flows. | Operating expenses more than doubled in 2023 to RM3,323 million from RM1,470 million in 2022, signaling a significant increase in cost base that pressured operating income. Cost of goods sold also increased to RM4,967 million from RM4,610 million, but gross profit remained relatively stable. Asset turnover was reported at 44.43% in 2023, indicating moderate asset utilization. Net cash from operations decreased to RM2,816 million from RM3,303 million, reflecting lower cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased slightly to RM22 million from RM8 million, but current liabilities rose faster than current assets, contributing to a slight decline in liquidity. Net cash from investing activities improved (less negative) to RM(764) million from RM(1,296) million, suggesting reduced capital expenditure or asset purchases. Overall, operational efficiency appears challenged by rising expenses and lower cash flow from operations. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show a mixed but generally positive trend in 2024. Leverage decreased as the debt to equity ratio improved to 278.02% from 296.66%, reducing financial risk. Interest expense slightly increased to RM481 million from RM473 million, but interest coverage ratio improved markedly to 483.16% from 399.58%, indicating a stronger ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate declined to 25.63% from 31.30%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially reducing tax-related risks. Current liabilities increased slightly, and the current ratio fell to 51.85%, suggesting some liquidity pressure. The net increase in cash was negative at RM87 million, slightly worse than the prior year. Overall, Maxis shows improved leverage and interest coverage but should monitor liquidity and cash position closely to mitigate short-term financial risks. | Leverage increased in 2023 as evidenced by the higher debt to equity ratio of 296.66% compared to 278.44% in 2022, indicating increased reliance on debt financing. Interest expense rose to RM473 million from RM437 million, while interest coverage ratio deteriorated to 399.58% from 505.49%, signaling reduced ability to cover interest obligations from operating income. The current ratio slightly declined to 56.09% from 57.79%, reflecting marginally weaker liquidity. The effective tax rate decreased to 31.30% from 36.13%, which may positively impact net profitability but also suggests changes in tax environment or tax planning. The increase in current liabilities and operating expenses, combined with lower net profit and cash from operations, highlight potential financial risks related to cost management and short-term liquidity pressures. |
| Future financial performance projection | Maxis Berhad's future financial performance appears sustainable with positive indicators. Investment activity, as reflected by net cash used in investing, decreased to RM693 million from RM764 million, indicating slightly lower capital expenditure or asset purchases. Net cash from operations increased to RM3,057 million, supporting cash flow sustainability. Financing cash inflows rose to RM2,451 million from RM2,113 million, which may support dividend payments and debt management. Dividends paid were RM1,253 million, slightly lower than RM1,331 million in 2023, suggesting a stable dividend policy. Revenue growth in key segments such as consumer (RM7.26 billion vs RM7.06 billion) and enterprise (RM1.61 billion vs RM1.51 billion) along with geographic expansion (Malaysia revenue up to RM10,316 million from RM9,995 million; other countries up to RM220 million from RM185 million) indicate growth opportunities. The increase in service and device revenues supports diversified income streams. Overall, Maxis is positioned for steady future performance with balanced investment, strong cash flow, and growth in core markets. | Maxis Berhad's net cash from investing activities improved significantly to RM(764) million from RM(1,296) million in 2022, indicating reduced capital expenditure or more efficient investment spending, which may support future cash flow sustainability. Net cash from financing activities turned positive at RM2,113 million in 2023 compared to an outflow of RM(2,570) million in 2022, suggesting new debt or equity inflows that could fund growth or liquidity needs. Dividends paid decreased to RM1,331 million from RM1,566 million, reflecting a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue growth was driven by service revenue increasing to RM8.572 billion from RM8.336 billion, with device revenue reported at RM1.61 billion in 2023. The consumer segment dominates revenue at RM7.06 billion, with postpaid and prepaid contributing significantly, while the enterprise segment contributed RM1.51 billion. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia increased to RM9,995 million from RM9,536 million, while other countries declined to RM185 million from RM253 million, indicating a focus on domestic market growth. These factors suggest a cautious but stable outlook with emphasis on domestic service revenue growth and controlled investment spending. |
