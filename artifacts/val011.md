The gross margin has decreased from 62.27% in 2022 to 56.38% in 2023, and slightly improved to 57.35% in 2024, suggesting a recovery in profitability despite rising costs. Revenue by product shows that the 'Data' segment has grown significantly from RM1,189,823 in 2022 to RM1,454,092 in 2024, while 'Cloud and other services' have remained relatively stable, and 'Voice' has seen a decline. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia has increased from RM1,395,596 in 2022 to RM1,614,587 in 2024, while revenue from outside Malaysia has also grown but remains a small portion of total revenue, indicating a strong domestic market focus. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin has declined from 34.54% in 2022 to 24.14% in 2023, and further to 26.09% in 2024, reflecting challenges in managing operating expenses relative to revenue.

| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has fluctuated, increasing from 25.35% in 2022 to 32.98% in 2023, before decreasing to 26.73% in 2024. This volatility in the tax rate may have impacted net profitability, particularly in 2023 when the net profit margin spiked to 161.85%, likely due to non-recurring items or accounting adjustments. The net profit has shown a significant drop from RM453,610 in 2022 to RM257,490 in 2023, before recovering to RM385,480 in 2024, indicating that external factors, possibly including market conditions or regulatory changes, have influenced profitability during this period. |
