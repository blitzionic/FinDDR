# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth shows a consistent upward trend from 2022 to 2024, increasing from £1,454.834 in 2022 to £1,690.195 in 2024, representing a growth of approximately 16.2%. The gross margin has decreased from 62.27% in 2022 to 57.35% in 2024, indicating rising costs relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service indicates that the primary revenue source is from data services, which grew from £1,352,919 in 2023 to £1,454,092 in 2024. Geographic revenue distribution shows a strong reliance on the Malaysian market, with revenue from Malaysia increasing from £1,520,391 in 2023 to £1,614,587 in 2024, while revenue from outside Malaysia also saw a slight increase. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin has shown a declining trend, decreasing from 34.54% in 2022 to 26.09% in 2024. This decline suggests that while revenue has increased, operating expenses have risen at a faster rate, with operating expenses increasing from £425.184 in 2022 to £504.180 in 2024. The relationship between operating income and revenue indicates a decrease in operational performance, with operating income falling from £502.572 in 2022 to £440.892 in 2024 despite revenue growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has fluctuated, increasing from 25.35% in 2022 to 26.73% in 2024, which may impact net profitability. Notably, the net profit margin has dramatically decreased from 31.18% in 2022 to 22.81% in 2024, with a significant anomaly in 2023 where the net profit margin was reported at 161.85%, likely due to non-recurring items or unusual accounting practices. External factors affecting profitability may include market conditions in Malaysia and operational challenges that have led to increased costs. |
