# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased steadily from RM1,454,834K in 2022 to RM1,690,195K in 2024, representing a growth of approximately 9.35% from 2022 to 2023 and 6.25% from 2023 to 2024. Gross margin declined from 62.27% in 2022 to 56.38% in 2023 and slightly improved to 57.35% in 2024, indicating some pressure on cost of goods sold relative to revenue despite recent stabilization. Revenue by product/service in 2024 shows Data as the dominant segment at RM1,454,092K, growing by 7.56% from RM1,352,919K in 2023. Cloud and other services revenue remained stable around RM185,000K, while Voice revenue declined slightly from RM50,218K in 2023 to RM47,012K in 2024. Others segment increased marginally. Geographically, revenue is heavily concentrated in Malaysia, increasing from RM1,520,391K in 2023 to RM1,614,587K in 2024, a 6.23% rise, while revenue outside Malaysia also grew by 7.11% from RM70,559K to RM75,608K, showing consistent growth in both domestic and international markets but with a strong domestic focus. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from a strong 34.54% in 2022 to 24.14% in 2023, then improved slightly to 26.09% in 2024, reflecting some recovery in operational efficiency after a significant dip. Operating income decreased from RM502,572K in 2022 to RM384,123K in 2023 but rebounded to RM440,892K in 2024, indicating partial restoration of profitability relative to revenue growth. Operating expenses increased from RM421,091K in 2022 to RM532,146K in 2023 but then decreased to RM504,180K in 2024, suggesting improved cost management in the latest year. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that despite revenue growth, operating income was pressured in 2023 due to higher operating expenses but improved in 2024 as expenses were better controlled, enhancing operating leverage. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 25.35% in 2022 to 32.98% in 2023 before declining to 26.73% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability in 2023. Net profit margin in 2023 was anomalously high at 161.85%, driven by a net profit of RM2,574,905K that is inconsistent with other income statement figures, suggesting a possible one-off gain or accounting anomaly in 2023. Excluding this anomaly, net profit margin trends align more closely with operating margin trends, with 2024 net profit margin at 22.81% and 2022 at 31.18%. No other explicit non-recurring items or external factors are noted, but the unusual 2023 net profit figure indicates a significant one-off event affecting profitability that year. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the companyâs total assets decreased to RM5,037,966 thousand from RM5,314,868 thousand in 2023, indicating a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a decline in current assets from RM2,011,054 thousand to RM1,657,181 thousand. Non-current assets slightly increased to RM3,380,785 thousand. Total liabilities decreased marginally to RM1,105,864 thousand from RM1,139,285 thousand, with current liabilities reducing from RM527,442 thousand to RM480,799 thousand, while non-current liabilities slightly increased. Shareholders' equity declined to RM3,932,102 thousand from RM4,175,583 thousand, reflecting a reduction in retained earnings from RM2,610,465 thousand to RM2,363,339 thousand. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, decreased but remained strong at 344.67% in 2024 compared to 381.28% in 2023. The debt to equity ratio slightly increased to 28.12% from 27.28%, indicating a stable but slightly higher leverage position. Overall, the company maintains a solid financial position with strong equity and manageable liabilities, though asset contraction and equity reduction suggest cautious monitoring is warranted. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a strong financial position with total assets increasing significantly from RM4,189,389 thousand in 2022 to RM5,314,868 thousand, indicating robust asset growth. Non-current assets grew notably, suggesting increased investment in long-term resources. Total liabilities rose moderately from RM1,061,659 thousand to RM1,139,285 thousand, but the debt to equity ratio improved from 33.94% to 27.28%, reflecting prudent liability management and a stronger equity base, which increased from RM3,127,730 thousand to RM4,175,583 thousand. The current ratio improved from 321.69% to 381.28%, indicating enhanced liquidity and a solid capital structure capable of meeting short-term obligations comfortably. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 6.2% to RM1,690,195 thousand in 2024 from RM1,590,950 thousand in 2023, supported by growth in the Data segment and Malaysia geographic region. Cost of goods sold rose moderately, but gross margin improved to 57.35% from 56.38%, indicating better cost control or pricing power. Operating expenses decreased to RM504,180 thousand from RM532,146 thousand, contributing to an improved operating income of RM440,892 thousand, up 14.8% from RM384,123 thousand, and an operating margin increase to 26.09% from 24.14%. However, net profit declined sharply to RM385,480 thousand from RM2,574,905 thousand in 2023, causing net profit margin to fall to 22.81% from an unusually high 161.85% previously, suggesting 2023 had extraordinary items inflating net profit. Return on equity and assets dropped significantly to 9.51% and 7.45% respectively, from 70.51% and 54.18%, indicating lower earnings quality and sustainability despite improved operational profitability. The effective tax rate decreased to 26.73% from 32.98%, slightly enhancing after-tax profitability. | Revenue increased by approximately 9.3% from RM1,454,834 thousand in 2022 to RM1,590,950 thousand in 2023, showing positive top-line growth. However, cost of goods sold rose disproportionately, leading to a decline in gross margin from 62.27% to 56.38%. Operating income decreased from RM502,572 thousand to RM384,123 thousand, causing the operating margin to fall from 34.54% to 24.14%. Despite this, net profit surged dramatically to RM2,574,905 thousand in 2023 from RM453,610 thousand in 2022, resulting in an exceptional net profit margin of 161.85%, which suggests extraordinary items or non-operating gains impacting earnings quality. Return on equity and return on assets were strong at 70.51% and 54.18% respectively, indicating high earnings sustainability and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased from 25.35% to 32.98%, slightly reducing net income but not detracting from overall profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | The company demonstrated improved cost control with operating expenses declining and operating margin rising to 26.09%. Asset turnover slightly decreased to 32.65% from 33.48%, reflecting marginally less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations declined to RM628,775 thousand from RM767,899 thousand, indicating reduced cash generation capacity. Working capital contracted as current assets decreased more than current liabilities, consistent with the lower current ratio. Despite these, the company maintained positive operating cash flow, supporting ongoing operations. The revenue mix shows stable contributions from Data and Cloud services, with slight declines in Voice revenue, suggesting operational focus areas. Overall, operational efficiency improved in cost management but asset utilization and cash flow generation weakened somewhat. | Operating expenses increased from RM421,091 thousand to RM532,146 thousand, reflecting higher costs that contributed to the reduced operating margin. Asset turnover was high at 33.48, indicating efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations remained stable, increasing slightly from RM755,784 thousand to RM767,899 thousand, supporting operational cash flow strength. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, enhancing liquidity. The company maintained effective cost control relative to revenue growth, but the rise in operating expenses suggests room for further efficiency improvements. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remained stable with a slight increase in debt to equity ratio to 28.12% from 27.28%, indicating no significant increase in financial risk from borrowing. Interest expense rose slightly to RM24,020 thousand from RM22,409 thousand, but interest coverage improved to 1835.52% from 1714.15%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest obligations and low default risk. Liquidity remains robust with a current ratio of 344.67%, though lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate decreased, reducing tax burden risk. No significant early warning signs of financial distress are evident, but the sharp decline in net profit and retained earnings warrants monitoring for earnings sustainability and potential impacts on equity and dividend capacity. | Leverage indicators improved with a lower debt to equity ratio of 27.28% compared to 33.94% in 2022, reducing financial risk. The current ratio of 381.28% indicates strong liquidity and low short-term solvency risk. Interest expense increased from RM18,052 thousand to RM22,409 thousand, but interest coverage remained very high at 1714.15%, down from 2784.02% in 2022, indicating ample ability to meet interest obligations despite the increase. The higher effective tax rate and increased interest expense represent moderate risks, but overall financial risk remains low given strong coverage and liquidity metrics. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities sharply reduced with net cash from investing dropping to RM55,449 thousand from RM1,551,465 thousand in 2023, indicating a significant slowdown in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions, which may constrain future growth. Financing cash outflows also decreased to RM(678,031) thousand from RM(1,613,108) thousand, alongside lower dividends paid of RM(630,077) thousand versus RM(1,570,377) thousand, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy and reduced external financing. Revenue growth in the Malaysia region and Data segment indicates potential focus areas for expansion. The modest net increase in cash of RM6,193 thousand suggests tight cash flow management. Overall, the company appears to be prioritizing cash conservation and operational profitability over aggressive expansion, which may stabilize financial performance but limit growth momentum in the near term. | The company showed significant positive cash flow from investing activities in 2023 at RM1,551,465 thousand compared to a negative RM442,927 thousand in 2022, indicating substantial asset acquisitions or investments that may drive future growth. Net cash from financing was negative at RM1,613,108 thousand, reflecting possible debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends paid increased substantially to RM1,570,377 thousand, suggesting a shareholder-friendly dividend policy but also a significant cash outflow. Revenue concentration remains heavily weighted towards Malaysia (RM1,520,391 thousand) with limited international exposure (RM70,559 thousand), indicating potential geographic growth opportunities. Overall, the company is positioned for growth with strong investment activities and cash flow sustainability, though dividend payouts are high and should be monitored for long-term cash flow impact. |
