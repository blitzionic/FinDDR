# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | TIME dotCom Berhad's revenue showed a consistent upward trend from RM 1,454,834 thousand in 2022 to RM 1,590,950 thousand in 2023, and further to RM 1,690,195 thousand in 2024. Despite this growth, gross profit declined from RM 1,230,955 thousand in 2022 to RM 896,030 thousand in 2023, before recovering to RM 969,267 thousand in 2024. The gross margin was stable and high in 2023 and 2024 at approximately 143.62% and 142.65% respectively, compared to 100.02% in 2022, indicating improved cost efficiency or pricing power. Revenue by product/service shows that Data services dominate, increasing from RM 1,189,823 thousand in 2022 to RM 1,454,092 thousand in 2024, while Cloud and other services slightly decreased from RM 209,040 thousand in 2022 to RM 185,740 thousand in 2024. Voice and Others revenue declined slightly over the period. Geographically, the majority of revenue is generated in Malaysia, growing from RM 1,395,596 thousand in 2022 to RM 1,614,587 thousand in 2024, with outside Malaysia revenue also increasing from RM 59,238 thousand to RM 75,608 thousand, indicating steady domestic and international market expansion. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 34.54% in 2022 to 24.14% in 2023 but improved slightly to 26.09% in 2024, reflecting some pressure on operating profitability despite revenue growth. Operating income decreased from RM 502,572 thousand in 2022 to RM 384,123 thousand in 2023, then rose to RM 440,892 thousand in 2024, showing recovery but not reaching 2022 levels. Operating expenses decreased from RM 728,383 thousand in 2022 to RM 531,156 thousand in 2023 and further to RM 504,180 thousand in 2024, indicating effective cost management efforts. The reduction in operating expenses helped mitigate the decline in operating income and margin, suggesting the company is focusing on controlling costs to sustain profitability amid revenue and gross profit fluctuations. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted significantly from a positive 25.35% in 2022 to negative rates of (32.98%) in 2023 and (26.73%) in 2024, indicating tax benefits or credits that positively impacted net profitability in the latter years. This change contributed to the unusually high net profit margin of 161.85% in 2023, which is an outlier compared to 31.18% in 2022 and 22.81% in 2024, suggesting the presence of non-recurring tax-related items or adjustments. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, so the tax rate changes appear to be the primary external influence on profitability during this period. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, TIME dotCom Berhad's total assets decreased to RM 5,037,966 thousand from RM 5,314,868 thousand in 2023, reflecting a contraction of approximately 5.3%. This decline was primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from RM 2,011,054 thousand to RM 1,657,181 thousand, partially offset by a slight increase in non-current assets from RM 3,303,814 thousand to RM 3,380,785 thousand. Total liabilities also decreased marginally by about 2.9% to RM 1,105,864 thousand, with current liabilities reducing from RM 527,442 thousand to RM 480,799 thousand, while non-current liabilities slightly increased to RM 625,065 thousand. Shareholders' equity declined by 5.8% to RM 3,899,179 thousand, driven by a decrease in retained earnings from RM 2,610,465 thousand to RM 2,363,339 thousand. The current ratio remained strong but decreased from 381.28% to 344.67%, indicating a slight reduction in liquidity but still a very comfortable short-term financial position. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly from 27.52% to 28.36%, suggesting a marginally higher leverage but still a conservative capital structure. Overall, the company maintains solid financial health with strong equity base and manageable liabilities, though asset base and liquidity have contracted somewhat in 2024. | In 2023, TIME dotCom Berhad demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing significantly from RM 4,189,389 thousand in 2022 to RM 5,314,868 thousand, driven primarily by a rise in non-current assets from RM 2,380,256 thousand to RM 3,303,814 thousand. Total liabilities increased modestly from RM 1,061,659 thousand to RM 1,139,285 thousand, with current liabilities decreasing slightly and non-current liabilities rising. Shareholders' equity grew substantially by approximately 33.4% to RM 4,139,574 thousand, supported by a strong increase in retained earnings to RM 2,610,465 thousand. The current ratio improved from 321.69% to 381.28%, indicating enhanced liquidity and a strong ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 34.23% to 27.52%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 is robust, characterized by asset growth, improved liquidity, and a strengthened equity base with controlled liabilities. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | TIME dotCom Berhad experienced revenue growth of 6.2% in 2024, increasing from RM 1,590,950 thousand to RM 1,690,195 thousand. Gross profit improved by 8.2% to RM 969,267 thousand, with gross margin slightly declining from 143.62% to 142.65%, indicating stable cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income rose by 14.8% to RM 440,892 thousand, with operating margin improving from 24.14% to 26.09%, reflecting better control over operating expenses which decreased from RM 531,156 thousand to RM 504,180 thousand. However, net profit declined sharply by 85% to RM 385,480 thousand from an unusually high RM 2,574,905 thousand in 2023, causing net profit margin to drop from 161.85% to 22.81%. This large discrepancy suggests 2023 net profit included significant non-operating or one-time gains not repeated in 2024. Income before taxes increased by 20.8% to RM 526,134 thousand, while income tax expense slightly decreased, resulting in a lower effective tax rate of 26.73% compared to 32.98% in 2023. Return on equity and return on assets both declined substantially to 9.59% and 7.45% respectively, from very high prior year levels, indicating normalized but lower profitability and earnings quality in 2024. Overall, the company shows improved operational profitability but normalized net earnings after a very strong 2023. | Revenue increased by 9.3% from RM 1,454,834 thousand in 2022 to RM 1,590,950 thousand in 2023, indicating top-line growth. However, gross profit declined from RM 1,230,955 thousand to RM 896,030 thousand, and operating income decreased from RM 502,572 thousand to RM 384,123 thousand, resulting in a drop in operating margin from 34.54% to 24.14%. Despite this, net profit surged dramatically from RM 453,610 thousand to RM 2,574,905 thousand, pushing the net profit margin from 31.18% to an exceptional 161.85%. This anomaly is explained by a negative income tax expense (a tax benefit) of RM (143,619) thousand in 2023 compared to a tax expense of RM 131,141 thousand in 2022, resulting in an effective tax rate of (32.98)%. Return on equity and return on assets were strong at 71.12% and 54.18%, respectively, indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The large net profit increase despite lower operating income suggests significant non-operating gains or tax benefits impacting earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, TIME dotCom Berhad demonstrated improved cost control in 2024, with operating expenses decreasing by 5.1% despite revenue growth. Asset turnover slightly declined from 33.48% to 32.65%, indicating a marginally lower efficiency in generating revenue from assets. Net cash from operations decreased by 18.1% to RM 628,775 thousand, reflecting lower cash generation capacity compared to RM 767,899 thousand in 2023. Working capital contracted as current assets fell more than current liabilities, consistent with the reduced current ratio. Net cash from investing activities dropped sharply from RM 1,551,465 thousand inflow in 2023 to RM 55,449 thousand inflow in 2024, suggesting significantly lower investment or asset disposals. Net cash used in financing activities also decreased from RM (1,613,108) thousand to RM (678,031) thousand, with dividends paid reduced by 59.9% to RM (630,077) thousand, indicating a more conservative cash outflow policy. The net increase in cash was minimal at RM 6,193 thousand compared to RM 706,256 thousand in 2023, signaling tight cash flow management. Overall, the company improved operational cost efficiency but experienced lower cash flow generation and investment activity in 2024. | Cost of goods sold increased substantially from RM 223,879 thousand in 2022 to RM 693,920 thousand in 2023, which contributed to the decline in gross profit. Operating expenses decreased from RM 728,383 thousand to RM 531,156 thousand, reflecting improved cost control at the operating expense level. Asset turnover was high at 33.48, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations remained stable, increasing slightly from RM 755,784 thousand to RM 767,899 thousand, supporting operational cash flow sustainability. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities decreased, consistent with the improved current ratio. Overall, the company managed to control operating expenses effectively despite higher cost of goods sold, maintaining strong cash flow from operations and efficient asset utilization. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for 2024 show a stable but cautious profile. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly to 28.36% from 27.52%, indicating a modest rise in leverage but still low relative to equity. The current ratio decreased to 344.67% from 381.28%, reflecting a slight reduction in liquidity but remaining very strong, suggesting low short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense increased marginally to RM 24,020 thousand, but interest coverage ratio improved to 1835.52% from 1714.15%, indicating excellent ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate declined to 26.73% from 32.98%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment but does not indicate increased risk. No inventories data is available, so inventory-related risks cannot be assessed. The sharp decline in net profit margin and returns on equity and assets may signal earnings volatility risk. Overall, the company maintains low financial risk with strong liquidity and coverage ratios, though profitability volatility warrants monitoring. | Leverage risk appears reduced in 2023 with the debt to equity ratio declining from 34.23% to 27.52%, indicating lower reliance on debt financing. Liquidity risk is low given the strong current ratio improvement to 381.28%. Interest coverage, while decreased from 2784.02% to 1714.15%, remains extremely high, suggesting ample earnings to cover interest expenses despite a slight increase in interest expense from RM 18,052 thousand to RM 22,409 thousand. The effective tax rate turned negative to (32.98)%, which may indicate tax credits or deferred tax benefits but also introduces some uncertainty in tax expense predictability. The large net profit margin driven by tax benefits and non-operating items could mask underlying operational risks. No inventories data is available, but given the nature of the business, inventory risk is likely minimal. Overall, financial risk is low but the unusual tax and net profit figures warrant monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, TIME dotCom Berhad's reduced net cash from investing activities in 2024 suggests a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions, which may limit growth opportunities but conserve cash. The significant reduction in dividends paid indicates a more conservative dividend policy, potentially preserving cash for future investments or debt reduction. Revenue growth in core segments such as Data (increasing from RM 1,352,919 thousand to RM 1,454,092 thousand) and geographic expansion outside Malaysia (from RM 70,559 thousand to RM 75,608 thousand) provide positive cues for sustained top-line growth. The stable contribution from Cloud and other services and slight decline in Voice revenue suggest a shift in product mix that may impact future margins. The company's strong liquidity and low leverage position it well to sustain operations and invest selectively. However, the decline in net profitability and cash flow generation signals the need for careful management to maintain financial sustainability. Overall, the company appears positioned for moderate growth with prudent financial management, but future performance will depend on investment decisions and market dynamics in key segments and regions. | The company’s net cash from investing activities shifted dramatically from an outflow of RM (442,927) thousand in 2022 to a large inflow of RM 1,551,465 thousand in 2023, suggesting significant divestments or asset sales that may not be sustainable long-term. Net cash from financing activities showed a larger outflow of RM (1,613,108) thousand compared to RM (588,072) thousand in 2022, driven in part by increased dividend payments rising from RM (540,167) thousand to RM (1,570,377) thousand, indicating a strong dividend policy but also substantial cash outflows to shareholders. Revenue growth in the core Data segment increased from RM 1,189,823 thousand to RM 1,352,919 thousand, while Cloud and other services and Voice segments declined slightly, suggesting a focus on data services. Geographic revenue growth was seen both domestically and internationally, with Malaysia revenue increasing to RM 1,520,391 thousand and outside Malaysia to RM 70,559 thousand. The strong operational cash flow and equity base support sustainable future performance, but reliance on investing cash inflows and high dividend payouts may pressure liquidity if not managed carefully. The company appears positioned for continued growth in data services with geographic expansion potential. |
