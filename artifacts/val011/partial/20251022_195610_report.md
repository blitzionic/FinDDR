# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | TIME dotCom Berhad's revenue remained flat from 2022 to 2023 at MYR 1,590,950 thousand, then increased by 6.2% to MYR 1,690,195 thousand in 2024. Gross margin declined from 65.50% in 2022 to 56.38% in 2023 and slightly improved to 57.35% in 2024, indicating rising cost pressures. Revenue by product shows Data services as the dominant contributor, growing from MYR 1,189,823 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,454,092 thousand in 2024, while Cloud and other services declined from MYR 209,040 thousand in 2022 to MYR 185,740 thousand in 2024. Voice and Others revenue also decreased slightly. Geographically, revenue from Malaysia increased steadily from MYR 1,395,596 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,614,587 thousand in 2024, while revenue outside Malaysia grew modestly from MYR 59,238 thousand to MYR 75,608 thousand over the same period. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 31.59% in 2022 to 24.14% in 2023 and improved slightly to 26.09% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating efficiency. Operating income decreased from MYR 502,572 thousand in 2022 to MYR 384,123 thousand in 2023, then rebounded to MYR 440,892 thousand in 2024, but did not reach 2022 levels despite revenue growth. Operating expenses nearly doubled from MYR 272,104 thousand in 2022 to MYR 531,146 thousand in 2023, before decreasing to MYR 504,180 thousand in 2024, indicating significant cost management challenges in 2023 with some improvement in 2024. The increase in operating expenses outpaced revenue growth, pressuring profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 25.35% in 2022 to 32.98% in 2023, then decreased to 26.73% in 2024, impacting net profitability. The unusually high net profit of MYR 2,574,905 thousand in 2023 compared to MYR 453,610 thousand in 2022 and MYR 385,480 thousand in 2024 suggests the presence of significant non-recurring items in 2023, although these are not explicitly detailed in the data. No other external factors affecting profitability are explicitly listed. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, TIME dotCom Berhad's total assets decreased to MYR 5,037,966 thousand from MYR 5,314,868 thousand in 2023, reflecting a contraction of approximately 5.3%. This decline was primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from MYR 2,011,054 thousand to MYR 1,657,181 thousand, partially offset by a slight increase in non-current assets from MYR 3,303,814 thousand to MYR 3,380,785 thousand. Total liabilities also decreased marginally by about 2.9% to MYR 1,105,864 thousand, with current liabilities dropping from MYR 527,442 thousand to MYR 480,799 thousand, while non-current liabilities slightly increased to MYR 625,065 thousand. Shareholders' equity declined by 5.8% to MYR 3,899,179 thousand, driven by a reduction in retained earnings from MYR 2,610,465 thousand to MYR 2,363,339 thousand. The current ratio remained strong but decreased from 381.28% to 344.67%, indicating a slight reduction in liquidity but still a very comfortable short-term financial position. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly from 27.52% to 28.36%, suggesting a marginally higher leverage but still a conservative capital structure overall. | In 2023, TIME dotCom Berhad demonstrated significant growth in total assets, increasing from MYR 4,151,820 thousand in 2022 to MYR 5,314,868 thousand, indicating substantial asset base expansion. Current assets rose moderately from MYR 1,809,133 thousand to MYR 2,011,054 thousand, while non-current assets increased notably from MYR 2,380,256 thousand to MYR 3,303,814 thousand, reflecting possible investments in long-term assets. Total liabilities increased slightly from MYR 1,061,659 thousand to MYR 1,139,285 thousand, with current liabilities decreasing from MYR 562,378 thousand to MYR 527,442 thousand and non-current liabilities rising from MYR 499,281 thousand to MYR 611,843 thousand. Shareholders' equity grew significantly from MYR 3,127,730 thousand to MYR 4,139,574 thousand, supported by an increase in retained earnings from MYR 1,611,489 thousand to MYR 2,610,465 thousand. The current ratio improved from 321.69% to 381.28%, indicating enhanced liquidity and ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 33.94% to 27.52%, suggesting a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the companyâs financial health in 2023 shows strong asset growth, improved liquidity, and a solid equity base with controlled liabilities. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | TIME dotCom Berhad showed revenue growth of 6.2% in 2024, increasing from MYR 1,590,950 thousand to MYR 1,690,195 thousand. Gross profit improved by 8.2% to MYR 969,267 thousand, with the gross margin increasing from 56.38% to 57.35%, indicating improved cost efficiency in production or service delivery. Operating income rose by 14.8% to MYR 440,892 thousand, with operating margin improving from 24.14% to 26.09%, reflecting better control over operating expenses which decreased from MYR 531,146 thousand to MYR 504,180 thousand. Income before taxes increased by 20.8% to MYR 526,134 thousand, while income tax expense slightly decreased to MYR 140,654 thousand, resulting in a lower effective tax rate of 26.73% compared to 32.98% in 2023. However, net profit declined sharply by 85% to MYR 385,480 thousand from an unusually high MYR 2,574,905 thousand in 2023, causing net profit margin to fall from 161.85% to 22.81%. This suggests that the 2023 net profit was likely influenced by non-recurring items or extraordinary gains not repeated in 2024. Return on equity and return on assets also declined significantly to 9.59% and 7.45% respectively, indicating lower earnings quality and profitability relative to the asset and equity base in 2024. | Revenue remained flat at MYR 1,590,950 thousand in 2023 compared to 2022, indicating stable top-line performance. However, cost of goods sold increased significantly from MYR 548,846 thousand to MYR 693,920 thousand, causing gross profit to slightly decline from MYR 905,988 thousand to MYR 896,030 thousand and gross margin to drop from 65.50% to 56.38%. Operating expenses nearly doubled from MYR 272,104 thousand to MYR 531,146 thousand, leading to a decrease in operating income from MYR 502,572 thousand to MYR 384,123 thousand and operating margin from 31.59% to 24.14%. Despite this, net profit surged dramatically from MYR 453,610 thousand to MYR 2,574,905 thousand, resulting in a net profit margin increase from 28.51% to 161.85%. This anomaly suggests significant non-operating income or extraordinary items impacting net profit. Income before taxes decreased from MYR 517,284 thousand to MYR 435,411 thousand, and income tax expense increased slightly, raising the effective tax rate from 25.35% to 32.98%. Return on equity and return on assets were strong at 70.86% and 89.87% respectively, indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, the company managed to reduce operating expenses by 5.1% despite revenue growth, indicating improved cost control. However, asset turnover declined substantially from 55.53% to 32.65%, signaling less efficient use of assets to generate revenue in 2024. Net cash from operations decreased by 18.1% to MYR 628,775 thousand, reflecting lower cash generation from core business activities. Working capital also contracted as current assets and current liabilities both decreased, with the current ratio falling but remaining strong. Net cash from investing activities dropped sharply from MYR 1,551,465 thousand inflow in 2023 to only MYR 55,449 thousand inflow in 2024, indicating a significant reduction in investment or asset disposals. Net cash from financing activities showed a smaller outflow of MYR 678,031 thousand compared to MYR 1,613,108 thousand in 2023, consistent with lower dividend payments and possibly reduced debt repayments or borrowings. Overall, while cost control improved, asset utilization and cash flow from operations weakened, suggesting operational efficiency challenges. | Operational efficiency in 2023 shows mixed results. The companyâs operating expenses increased substantially, indicating higher cost pressures or investments in operations. Asset turnover was very high at 55.53, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate revenue despite flat sales. Net cash from operations increased slightly from MYR 755,784 thousand to MYR 767,899 thousand, reflecting stable cash generation from core business activities. Working capital appears strong given the improved current ratio and stable current liabilities. Net cash from investing activities turned positive to MYR 1,551,465 thousand from a negative MYR 442,927 thousand in 2022, indicating asset disposals or returns on investments. Net cash from financing activities was negative at MYR 1,613,108 thousand, higher than the previous year, possibly due to debt repayments or dividend payments. The net increase in cash was positive at MYR 706,256 thousand, supporting liquidity. Overall, while cost control appears challenged, asset utilization and cash flow from operations remain robust. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The companyâs leverage remained low and stable with a slight increase in debt to equity ratio from 27.52% to 28.36%, indicating limited financial risk from debt. Interest expense increased marginally from MYR 22,409 thousand to MYR 24,020 thousand, but interest coverage ratio improved from 1714.15% to 1835.52%, showing strong ability to meet interest obligations comfortably. Liquidity remains robust with a current ratio of 344.67%, though lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate decreased from 32.98% to 26.73%, which may reflect changes in tax planning or jurisdictional tax rates, potentially impacting future tax liabilities. The sharp decline in net profit and returns on equity and assets could be an early warning sign of earnings volatility or one-off impacts affecting profitability quality. The significant drop in net cash from investing and financing activities also suggests a more conservative financial stance or reduced external funding, which could limit flexibility. Overall, financial risk appears moderate with strong liquidity and coverage but some caution warranted on earnings sustainability. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a moderate risk profile. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 27.52%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. Interest expense increased from MYR 18,052 thousand to MYR 22,409 thousand, but interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 1714.15%, down from 2784.02% in 2022, suggesting ample earnings to cover interest obligations despite the increase. The effective tax rate rose to 32.98% from 25.35%, which could impact net profitability if sustained. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio increase to 381.28%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. No inventories data is available, so inventory risk cannot be assessed. The large increase in net profit margin and net profit may warrant scrutiny for sustainability and risk of earnings volatility. Overall, the company maintains strong coverage and liquidity with manageable leverage, but tax rate increase and earnings volatility are potential early warning signs. |
| Future financial performance projection | The substantial reduction in net cash from investing activities from MYR 1,551,465 thousand in 2023 to MYR 55,449 thousand in 2024 indicates a marked slowdown in investment activity, which may constrain future growth prospects if sustained. The companyâs ability to generate positive but reduced net cash from operations (MYR 628,775 thousand) and maintain a strong current ratio suggests cash flow sustainability in the near term. Dividend payments decreased significantly from MYR 1,570,377 thousand to MYR 630,077 thousand, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly aimed at preserving cash. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the Data segment and Malaysia geographic region, with Data revenue increasing from MYR 1,352,919 thousand to MYR 1,454,092 thousand and Malaysia revenue from MYR 1,520,391 thousand to MYR 1,614,587 thousand, suggesting these areas remain core growth drivers. Cloud and other services and Voice segments showed stable or slightly declining revenues, which may require strategic focus. The companyâs cautious investment and financing approach combined with strong liquidity and moderate leverage position it well to manage future uncertainties, but growth may be limited without renewed capital expenditure or expansion initiatives. | The positive net cash from investing activities of MYR 1,551,465 thousand in 2023 suggests significant divestments or returns on investments, which may not be sustainable long-term if not replaced by new investments. The negative net cash from financing activities of MYR 1,613,108 thousand indicates possible debt repayments or dividend distributions, though dividends paid decreased substantially from MYR 270,085,360 thousand in 2022 to MYR 1,570,377 thousand in 2023, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy or data inconsistency. Revenue by product shows growth in Data services from MYR 1,189,823 thousand to MYR 1,352,919 thousand, while Cloud and other services and Voice revenues declined slightly, indicating a shift in business mix favoring Data. Geographic revenue increased in Malaysia from MYR 1,395,596 thousand to MYR 1,520,391 thousand and outside Malaysia from MYR 59,238 thousand to MYR 70,559 thousand, signaling expansion in domestic and international markets. Given strong cash flow from operations and improved liquidity, the company appears well-positioned for sustainable financial performance, though reliance on investing cash inflows and changes in dividend policy should be monitored. |
