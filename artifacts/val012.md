# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company experienced strong revenue growth from RM 107,281K in 2022 to RM 149,681K in 2023 (39.5% increase), and further to RM 220,232K in 2024 (47.1% increase). Gross profit rose from RM 78,032K in 2022 to RM 104,797K in 2023 (34.3% increase), and then to RM 134,950K in 2024 (28.8% increase). Gross margin improved steadily from 127.26% in 2022 to 129.99% in 2023 and further to 138.72% in 2024, indicating enhanced cost efficiency or pricing power relative to cost of goods sold. Revenue by product/service in 2024 shows a balanced contribution with Digital infrastructure solutions at RM 99,934K and Supply, installation and maintenance services at RM 116,926K, both significantly higher than 2023 figures (RM 91,133K and RM 54,665K respectively). Trading and Telecommunication/network infrastructure revenues are minor contributors. The Supply, installation and maintenance services segment more than doubled from 2023 to 2024, indicating strong growth focus or market demand in this area. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from RM 58,923K in 2022 to RM 79,357K in 2023 (34.7% increase) and further to RM 104,133K in 2024 (31.2% increase). However, operating margin declined from 54.92% in 2022 to 53.02% in 2023 and further to 47.28% in 2024, suggesting that operating expenses grew faster than revenue. Operating expenses were RM 25,635K in 2023 and increased to RM 34,106K in 2024 (33.1% increase), which partially explains the margin compression despite revenue growth. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that while absolute operating income improved, efficiency in converting revenue to operating profit weakened slightly. Cost management appears challenged as operating expenses rose significantly, impacting operating margin despite strong top-line growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 27.93% in 2022 to 23.26% in 2023 and slightly increased to 24.91% in 2024. This reduction in tax rate over the years positively impacted net profitability. Income tax expense rose from RM 15,730K in 2022 to RM 19,152K in 2023 and RM 26,700K in 2024, consistent with higher pre-tax profits. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are indicated in the data. External factors affecting profitability cannot be assessed due to lack of geographic revenue and external environment data. Overall, the tax rate trend contributed to sustaining net profit growth despite margin pressures at the operating level. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a strong financial position with total assets increasing from RM 437,991 thousand in 2023 to RM 505,763 thousand, reflecting significant asset growth driven by a rise in both current assets (from RM 295,574 thousand to RM 316,182 thousand) and non-current assets (from RM 142,417 thousand to RM 189,581 thousand).

Operating income grew by 31% to RM 104,133 thousand, though the operating margin declined from 53.02% to 47.28%, reflecting higher operating expenses relative to revenue. Net profit increased by 27% to RM 80,507 thousand, but net profit margin decreased from 42.22% to 36.56%, partly due to a higher effective tax rate (24.91% vs. 23.26%). Return on equity improved from 20.07% to 21.60%, and return on assets rose from 15.23% to 17.06%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. Overall, earnings growth is strong and sustainable, though margin compression suggests some cost pressures. | The company experienced robust profitability growth in 2023. Revenue increased significantly by approximately 39.5%, from RM 107,281 thousand in 2022 to RM 149,681 thousand. Gross profit rose by 34.3% to RM 104,797 thousand, with gross margin improving slightly from 127.26% to 129.99%, indicating effective cost of goods sold management despite higher absolute COGS. Operating income increased by 34.7% to RM 79,357 thousand, though operating margin decreased slightly from 54.92% to 53.02%, suggesting a modest increase in operating expenses (RM 25,635 thousand in 2023, unavailable in 2022 for direct comparison). Net profit grew strongly by 55.8% to RM 63,196 thousand, with net profit margin improving from 37.83% to 42.22%, reflecting enhanced earnings quality and operational leverage. Return on equity was 20.07% and return on assets 15.23%, both indicating efficient use of equity and assets to generate profits.

Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved markedly in 2023 with strong revenue growth, margin expansion, and solid returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed trends in 2024. The operating margin decreased to 47.28% from 53.02% in 2023, indicating increased operating expenses relative to revenue. However, asset turnover improved significantly from 36.07% to 46.67%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations declined from RM 56,045 thousand to RM 48,328 thousand, suggesting some challenges in converting earnings into cash flow. Inventories increased modestly from RM 17,811 thousand to RM 19,687 thousand, which may impact working capital management. Despite the decline in operating cash flow, the company maintains positive cash generation from core operations, but attention to cost control and working capital efficiency is warranted. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed positive trends. The operating margin remained high at 53.02%, only slightly lower than 54.92% in 2022, indicating good cost control relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover was 36.07%, a new reported metric, suggesting effective utilization of assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations increased by 35.7% from RM 41,297 thousand to RM 56,045 thousand, reflecting strong cash generation capacity. Inventories more than doubled from RM 8,416 thousand to RM 17,811 thousand, which may indicate increased stock levels to support higher sales but could also imply potential working capital tied up in inventory. Current liabilities increased slightly, but the current ratio improved, indicating sufficient short-term asset coverage. Overall, the company maintained strong operational efficiency with high margins, improved asset utilization, and robust operating cash flow generation. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a stable leverage profile with the debt to equity ratio slightly improving to 25.98% from 27.32% in 2023, indicating controlled use of debt. Interest expense decreased from RM 4,334 thousand to RM 3,012 thousand, while interest coverage ratio improved dramatically from 1831.03% to 3457.27%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest obligations and low financial risk. The current ratio declined from 664.90% to 452.33%, signaling reduced liquidity but still a very strong short-term position. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 24.91%, which may marginally impact net profitability. Overall, the company exhibits low financial risk with strong coverage and manageable leverage, though the decline in liquidity ratios should be monitored. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest a reduction in leverage and manageable liquidity risk. The debt to equity ratio decreased significantly from 37.11% to 27.32%, indicating lower financial leverage and reduced risk of over-indebtedness. Interest expense increased from RM 2,864 thousand to RM 4,334 thousand, but interest coverage remained very strong at 1831.03%, down slightly from 2057.37% in 2022, showing ample earnings to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate declined, which may reduce tax-related risks. Current liabilities increased modestly, but the current ratio improved, indicating strong liquidity. No significant early warning signs of financial distress are evident; the company appears well-positioned to meet its obligations with a conservative capital structure and strong earnings coverage. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities intensified in 2024, with net cash used in investing activities rising sharply from RM (18,451) thousand to RM (60,487) thousand, indicating significant capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities also increased in outflow from RM (31,971) thousand to RM (45,472) thousand, alongside a substantial increase in dividends paid from RM (8,225) thousand to RM (26,767) thousand, suggesting a commitment to returning value to shareholders but also higher cash outflows. The net decrease in cash of RM (57,631) thousand contrasts with a small increase in 2023, highlighting cash flow pressures. Revenue growth was driven notably by the supply, installation and maintenance services segment, which more than doubled from RM 54,665 thousand to RM 116,926 thousand, indicating a strong growth area. Digital infrastructure solutions also grew but at a slower pace. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. Overall, the company is investing heavily for growth, maintaining shareholder returns, but must manage cash flow sustainability carefully. | Investment activities in 2023 show a reduction in net cash used for investing from RM (38,839) thousand in 2022 to RM (18,451) thousand, suggesting a moderation in capital expenditures or asset purchases.

The net increase in cash was modest at RM 5,623 thousand, down sharply from RM 183,722 thousand in 2022, reflecting more conservative cash management. Dividends increased slightly from RM (8,000) thousand to RM (8,225) thousand, indicating a stable or slightly enhanced dividend policy. Revenue by product/service in 2023 was dominated by digital infrastructure solutions (RM 91,133 thousand) and supply, installation and maintenance services (RM 54,665 thousand), suggesting focus areas for growth.

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks including exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations primarily in USD and SGD, which could adversely impact earnings. The Group is also exposed to competition risks from existing and new competitors offering similar products and services, with no assurance that changes in the competitive environment will not materially affect business and financial performance.

The Group mitigates these risks by maintaining stringent quality assurance procedures, investing in market research and product development, and monitoring foreign currency exposure within acceptable levels without active hedging. Additionally, the Group acknowledges risks from rising costs of labor and raw materials, availability of skilled personnel, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates inherent to its industry. The Group remains cautious about ongoing market volatility and focuses on disciplined cost management and capital and liquidity buffers to sustain performance. The ASEAN Smart Cities market growth and government initiatives in Malaysia provide growth opportunities, but risks from geopolitical conflicts, trade tensions, and economic slowdowns remain. | The Group faces market risks including uncertainty from global and local economic conditions, competition from existing and new competitors offering similar services and products, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (primarily USD), rising costs of labour and raw materials, availability of skilled personnel, changes in laws and regulations, and volatility in business and credit conditions.
