# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company experienced strong revenue growth, increasing from MYR 107,281K in 2022 to MYR 149,681K in 2023 (a 39.5% increase), and further to MYR 220,232K in 2024 (a 47.1% increase from 2023). Gross profit rose correspondingly from MYR 78,032K in 2022 to MYR 104,797K in 2023 (34.3% increase), and then to MYR 134,950K in 2024 (28.8% increase). Gross margin improved steadily from 127.26% in 2022 to 129.99% in 2023 and further to 138.72% in 2024, indicating enhanced profitability on direct costs relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service in 2024 shows a significant shift compared to 2023: Digital infrastructure solutions revenue increased from MYR 91,133K to MYR 99,934K (9.7% growth), while Supply, installation and maintenance services more than doubled from MYR 54,665K to MYR 116,926K (114% growth), becoming the largest revenue contributor. Trading revenue decreased sharply from MYR 918K in 2023 to MYR 473K in 2024, and Telecommunication and network infrastructure and services remained relatively stable but small (MYR 2,965K in 2023 to MYR 2,899K in 2024). Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional analysis. Overall, the company shows robust revenue growth driven primarily by expansion in supply, installation and maintenance services, alongside improving gross margins reflecting better cost control or pricing power. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from MYR 58,923K in 2022 to MYR 79,357K in 2023 (34.7% increase), and further to MYR 104,133K in 2024 (31.2% increase). However, operating margin declined from 54.92% in 2022 to 53.02% in 2023 and further to 47.28% in 2024, indicating that operating expenses grew at a faster rate than revenue. Operating expenses rose from MYR 19,696K in 2022 to MYR 25,635K in 2023 (30.2% increase), and then to MYR 34,106K in 2024 (33.1% increase). Despite the absolute increase in operating income, the decreasing operating margin suggests some deterioration in operating efficiency or increased investment in operating activities. The relationship between operating income and revenue remains strong, with operating income representing a substantial portion of revenue, but the margin compression signals a need for tighter cost management or operational improvements to sustain profitability growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 27.93% in 2022 to 23.26% in 2023, then slightly increased to 24.91% in 2024. This reduction in tax rate from 2022 to 2023 positively impacted net profitability, contributing to net profit margin improvement from 37.83% in 2022 to 42.22% in 2023. However, the net profit margin declined to 36.56% in 2024 despite higher revenue and operating income, likely influenced by the slight increase in tax rate and possibly other non-disclosed factors. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the provided financials. External factors affecting profitability cannot be assessed due to lack of geographic revenue data and absence of notes on market or economic conditions. Overall, tax efficiency improved in 2023 but slightly reversed in 2024, impacting net profitability trends. |

Return on equity improved to 21.61% and return on assets increased to 17.06%, both indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate rose slightly to 24.91%, impacting net profitability. | The company exhibited strong profitability growth in 2023. Revenue increased by 39.5% from MYR 107,281 thousand to MYR 149,681 thousand, driven by diverse product/service lines with digital infrastructure solutions contributing MYR 91,133 thousand and supply, installation and maintenance services contributing MYR 54,665 thousand. Gross profit rose by 34.3% to MYR 104,797 thousand, with gross margin improving slightly from 127.26% to 129.99%, indicating effective cost of goods sold management despite higher absolute COGS. Operating income increased by 34.7% to MYR 79,357 thousand, though operating margin declined marginally from 54.92% to 53.02%, reflecting increased operating expenses. Net profit surged by 55.8% to MYR 63,196 thousand, with net profit margin improving significantly from 37.83% to 42.22%, highlighting enhanced earnings quality and operational leverage.

The effective tax rate decreased from 27.93% to 23.26%, contributing to higher net profitability. Overall, earnings quality and profitability improved substantially in 2023 with sustainable margins and strong returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased from MYR 25,635 thousand to MYR 34,106 thousand, contributing to a lower operating margin despite higher revenue. Asset turnover improved significantly from 36.07% to 46.67%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations decreased from MYR 56,045 thousand to MYR 48,328 thousand, suggesting some challenges in converting earnings into cash flow. Inventories increased modestly to MYR 19,687 thousand, which may impact working capital management. Overall, while asset utilization improved, cost control and cash flow generation showed some weakening in 2024. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed trends. Operating expenses increased by 30.2% to MYR 25,635 thousand, slightly outpacing revenue growth, which caused a small decline in operating margin to 53.02%. However, asset turnover was strong at 36.07%, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories more than doubled from MYR 8,416 thousand to MYR 17,811 thousand, which may suggest increased stockholding to support higher sales or potential inventory buildup. Net cash from operations increased by 35.7% to MYR 56,045 thousand, reflecting strong cash generation from core business activities. Working capital remained healthy with a current ratio of 664.90%, supported by current assets growth. Overall, the company maintained solid operational efficiency with strong asset utilization and cash flow generation, though cost control could be further optimized given the rise in operating expenses and inventories. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remained stable with a slight improvement in the debt to equity ratio from 27.34% to 26.00%, indicating controlled use of debt. Interest expense decreased from MYR 4,334 thousand to MYR 3,012 thousand, improving interest coverage dramatically from 1831.03% to 3457.27%, signaling strong ability to meet interest obligations. The current ratio declined but remained robust at 452.33%, indicating strong liquidity despite increased current liabilities. The effective tax rate increased slightly, which could affect net income sustainability. The increase in current liabilities relative to non-current liabilities suggests a potential short-term liquidity risk if cash flows weaken further. Overall, financial risk appears well managed but warrants monitoring of short-term obligations and cash flow. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest a reduction in leverage and manageable liquidity risk. The debt to equity ratio improved significantly from 37.11% to 27.34%, indicating lower reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased from MYR 2,864 thousand to MYR 4,334 thousand, but interest coverage remained very high at 1831.03%, down slightly from 2057.37%, showing ample earnings to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate decreased to 23.26%, reducing tax burden risk. Current liabilities increased slightly, but the current ratio of 664.90% indicates strong short-term liquidity. No significant tax rate changes or other financial risks are evident from the data. Overall, the company’s financial risk profile improved with lower leverage and strong coverage ratios, though monitoring interest expense trends is advisable. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities intensified in 2024, with net cash used in investing activities rising sharply from MYR (18,451) thousand to MYR (60,487) thousand, reflecting significant capital expenditures or acquisitions likely aimed at supporting future growth. Dividend payments increased substantially to MYR (26,767) thousand, indicating a more aggressive dividend policy which may impact cash reserves. Net cash from financing activities also increased in outflow to MYR (45,472) thousand, possibly reflecting debt repayments or share buybacks. Revenue growth was driven notably by the supply, installation and maintenance services segment, which more than doubled to MYR 116,926 thousand, suggesting a strategic focus area. The digital infrastructure solutions segment also grew but at a slower pace. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. Overall, the company is investing heavily for growth, supported by strong profitability, but cash flow sustainability should be closely monitored given increased investing and financing outflows. | The company’s future financial performance appears positive based on 2023 data. Investment activities, as reflected by net cash from investing at negative MYR 18,451 thousand, indicate ongoing capital expenditures but at a reduced level compared to 2022, suggesting more controlled investment spending. Net cash from financing was negative MYR 31,971 thousand, contrasting with a large positive inflow in 2022, indicating possible debt repayments or dividend payments, consistent with a strengthening balance sheet. Dividends increased slightly to MYR 8,225 thousand, reflecting a stable dividend policy supported by strong earnings and cash flow. Revenue concentration in digital infrastructure solutions and supply, installation and maintenance services suggests focus on high-growth segments. Absence of geographic revenue data limits regional trend analysis. Overall, the company is positioned for sustainable growth with controlled investment, strong cash flow, and a prudent dividend policy supporting shareholder returns. |
