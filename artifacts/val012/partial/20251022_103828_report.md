# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD's revenue showed a strong upward trend from MYR 107,281 thousand in 2022 to MYR 149,681 thousand in 2023, and further to MYR 220,232 thousand in 2024, representing a compound growth trajectory. Gross margin improved from 127.26% in 2022 to 129.99% in 2023 and further to 138.72% in 2024, indicating enhanced profitability on sales despite rising revenues. Revenue by product/service reveals that supply, installation and maintenance services nearly doubled from MYR 31,720 thousand in 2022 to MYR 54,665 thousand in 2023 and then more than doubled again to MYR 116,926 thousand in 2024, becoming the largest contributor in 2024. Digital infrastructure solutions also grew steadily from MYR 71,475 thousand in 2022 to MYR 99,934 thousand in 2024. Trading and telecommunication/network infrastructure services remained minor contributors. Geographically, all revenue was generated in Malaysia across the three years, with revenue increasing consistently from MYR 107,281 thousand in 2022 to MYR 220,232 thousand in 2024, showing strong domestic market growth. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 54.92% in 2022 to 53.02% in 2023 and further to 47.28% in 2024, indicating some pressure on operating profitability despite revenue growth. Operating income increased from MYR 58,923 thousand in 2022 to MYR 79,357 thousand in 2023 and MYR 104,133 thousand in 2024, but at a slower rate relative to revenue growth, reflecting the margin compression. Operating expenses rose from MYR 19,696 thousand in 2022 to MYR 25,635 thousand in 2023 and MYR 34,106 thousand in 2024, suggesting increased cost base possibly due to scaling operations or higher overheads. The company managed to grow operating income substantially but needs to monitor operating expense growth to sustain margin levels. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 27.93% in 2022 to 23.26% in 2023 and slightly increased to 24.91% in 2024, which positively impacted net profitability by reducing tax burden relative to pre-tax income. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, indicating that the profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance and tax rate changes rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD demonstrated solid financial health with total assets increasing to MYR 505,763 thousand from MYR 437,991 thousand in 2023, reflecting asset growth of approximately 15.4%. Current assets rose moderately to MYR 316,182 thousand, supporting liquidity, though the current ratio declined from 664.90% in 2023 to 452.33% in 2024, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity buffer but still a very strong liquidity position. Total liabilities increased to MYR 104,294 thousand from MYR 93,987 thousand, driven mainly by a rise in current liabilities to MYR 69,901 thousand from MYR 44,454 thousand, while non-current liabilities decreased significantly to MYR 34,393 thousand from MYR 49,533 thousand, suggesting a shift in liability structure towards short-term obligations. Shareholders' equity grew substantially to MYR 401,469 thousand from MYR 344,004 thousand, supported by increased retained earnings of MYR 191,196 thousand versus MYR 137,569 thousand in 2023, indicating strong internal capital generation. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 25.98% from 27.32%, reflecting a conservative capital structure with low leverage. Overall, the company maintains a robust balance sheet with strong equity base and manageable liabilities, though the increase in current liabilities warrants monitoring for liquidity management. | In 2023, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD demonstrated solid financial health with total assets increasing to MYR 437,991 thousand from MYR 391,902 thousand in 2022, reflecting asset growth of approximately 11.7%. Current assets rose to MYR 295,574 thousand, supporting liquidity, while non-current assets also increased moderately to MYR 142,417 thousand. Total liabilities decreased to MYR 93,987 thousand from MYR 106,078 thousand, indicating improved liability management and a reduction of about 11.4%. Current liabilities increased slightly to MYR 44,454 thousand, but non-current liabilities decreased significantly to MYR 49,533 thousand, enhancing the capital structure. Shareholders' equity grew substantially to MYR 344,004 thousand, up from MYR 285,824 thousand, driven by a strong increase in retained earnings to MYR 137,569 thousand. The current ratio improved marginally to 664.90%, indicating excellent short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio declined to 27.32% from 37.11%, reflecting a more conservative leverage position and stronger equity base. Overall, the company’s balance sheet shows enhanced financial stability, strong equity growth, and prudent liability management in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD's revenue surged by 47.1% to MYR 220,232 thousand in 2024 from MYR 149,681 thousand in 2023, driven primarily by a significant increase in supply, installation and maintenance services revenue (MYR 116,926 thousand in 2024 vs MYR 54,665 thousand in 2023). Gross profit increased to MYR 134,950 thousand from MYR 104,797 thousand, with gross margin improving to 138.72% from 129.99%, indicating enhanced pricing power or product mix benefits. Operating income rose to MYR 104,133 thousand from MYR 79,357 thousand, though operating margin declined to 47.28% from 53.02%, reflecting higher operating expenses (MYR 34,106 thousand vs MYR 25,635 thousand). Net profit increased to MYR 80,507 thousand from MYR 63,196 thousand, but net profit margin decreased to 36.56% from 42.22%, partly due to higher income tax expense (MYR 26,700 thousand vs MYR 19,152 thousand) and increased effective tax rate (24.91% vs 23.26%). Return on equity improved to 21.60% from 20.07%, and return on assets increased to 17.06% from 15.23%, indicating better overall profitability and efficient use of equity and assets. Earnings quality appears solid with strong revenue growth and profitability, though margin compression suggests cost pressures or investment in growth. | ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD experienced robust profitability growth in 2023. Revenue increased significantly by approximately 39.5% to MYR 149,681 thousand from MYR 107,281 thousand in 2022. Gross profit rose to MYR 104,797 thousand, up 34.3%, with gross margin slightly improving to 129.99% from 127.26%, indicating effective cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. Operating income increased by 34.7% to MYR 79,357 thousand, though operating margin slightly declined to 53.02% from 54.92%, suggesting a modest increase in operating expenses relative to sales. Net profit surged by 55.8% to MYR 63,196 thousand, with net profit margin improving to 42.22% from 37.83%, reflecting strong bottom-line growth and earnings quality. Income before taxes increased to MYR 82,348 thousand, while income tax expense rose to MYR 19,152 thousand, but the effective tax rate decreased to 23.26% from 27.93%, enhancing net profitability. Return on equity and return on assets were reported at 20.07% and 15.23% respectively, indicating efficient use of equity and assets to generate profits. Overall, 2023 showed strong revenue and profit growth with improved earnings quality and solid returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD showed mixed efficiency trends in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased substantially to MYR 85,282 thousand from MYR 44,884 thousand, consistent with higher revenue, but gross margin improvement suggests effective cost management relative to sales. Operating expenses rose to MYR 34,106 thousand from MYR 25,635 thousand, indicating increased spending possibly for growth or operational support. Asset turnover improved markedly to 46.67% from 36.07%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations declined to MYR 48,328 thousand from MYR 56,045 thousand despite higher profits, which may indicate changes in working capital or collection cycles. Inventories increased slightly to MYR 19,687 thousand from MYR 17,811 thousand, which could impact working capital. The current ratio decreased but remains strong, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, the company improved asset utilization but faces some challenges in converting earnings into cash flow, warranting attention to working capital management. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023 as evidenced by increased revenue and controlled cost growth. Cost of goods sold rose to MYR 44,884 thousand from MYR 29,249 thousand, a 53.4% increase, but this was outpaced by revenue growth, supporting margin expansion. Operating expenses increased to MYR 25,635 thousand from MYR 19,696 thousand, a 30.2% rise, which is proportionally lower than revenue growth, indicating effective cost control. Asset turnover was reported at 36.07%, demonstrating strong utilization of assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations increased significantly to MYR 56,045 thousand from MYR 41,297 thousand, reflecting improved cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased to MYR 17,811 thousand from MYR 8,416 thousand, which may indicate higher stock levels to support sales growth but could also imply working capital tied up in inventory. The current ratio of 664.90% confirms ample liquidity to cover short-term obligations. Overall, the company enhanced operational efficiency through strong revenue growth, controlled expense increases, improved asset utilization, and robust operating cash flow generation in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for 2024 show a generally low risk profile for ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD. The debt to equity ratio improved slightly to 25.98% from 27.32%, indicating stable and low leverage. Interest expense decreased to MYR 3,012 thousand from MYR 4,334 thousand, and interest coverage ratio improved significantly to 3457.27% from 1831.03%, reflecting strong ability to service debt and low financial risk. The effective tax rate increased modestly to 24.91% from 23.26%, which may slightly impact net profitability but is not a major risk. The increase in current liabilities to MYR 69,901 thousand from MYR 44,454 thousand, alongside a decrease in non-current liabilities, suggests a shift towards short-term obligations that could pressure liquidity if not managed carefully. The decline in net cash from operations and significant net cash outflow in investing and financing activities (notably a large increase in investing cash outflow to MYR 60,487 thousand) may pose liquidity risks if sustained. No other explicit risks such as currency or geographic diversification issues are evident as revenue remains fully domestic. Overall, financial risk remains low but with some early warning signs in liquidity and cash flow management. | Financial risk indicators for 2023 suggest a relatively low risk profile for ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 27.32% from 37.11%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. Interest expense increased to MYR 4,334 thousand from MYR 2,864 thousand, but interest coverage remains very strong at 1831.03%, down slightly from 2057.37% in 2022, showing ample earnings to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate declined to 23.26% from 27.93%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax regulations, potentially reducing tax-related risks. Current liabilities increased slightly, but the current ratio remains very high at 664.90%, indicating strong liquidity and low short-term solvency risk. The increase in inventories could pose some working capital risk if not managed carefully. Overall, the company maintains a conservative capital structure, strong liquidity, and excellent interest coverage, suggesting low financial risk and no immediate early warning signs in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD's future financial performance may be influenced by its substantial investment activity, as evidenced by a large increase in net cash used in investing activities to MYR 60,487 thousand in 2024 from MYR 18,451 thousand in 2023, indicating expansion or capital expenditure that could drive future growth. However, net cash from financing activities also increased outflow to MYR 45,472 thousand, including higher dividends paid (MYR 26,767 thousand vs MYR 8,225 thousand), suggesting a shareholder-friendly dividend policy but also cash outflow pressure. The significant net decrease in cash of MYR 57,631 thousand in 2024 contrasts with a net increase in 2023, raising concerns about cash flow sustainability if operational cash generation does not improve. Revenue concentration remains fully domestic (Malaysia), with growth driven by supply, installation and maintenance services, which may guide strategic focus. The company’s strong equity base and low leverage provide financial flexibility to support ongoing investments. In summary, while investment and dividend policies reflect confidence and growth orientation, careful cash flow and liquidity management will be critical to sustain future financial performance. | Looking ahead, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD’s future financial performance appears sustainable and positive based on 2023 data. The company’s net cash from investing activities decreased in outflow to MYR (18,451) thousand from MYR (38,839) thousand in 2022, indicating reduced capital expenditure or investment spending, which may preserve cash. Net cash from financing activities turned negative to MYR (31,971) thousand from a large positive inflow in 2022, suggesting repayment of debt or reduced external financing, aligning with the lower debt to equity ratio. The modest net increase in cash of MYR 5,623 thousand and consistent dividend payments of MYR (8,225) thousand indicate a balanced approach to cash flow management and shareholder returns. Revenue concentration remains in Malaysia with significant growth in digital infrastructure solutions and supply, installation and maintenance services segments, which may drive future growth. The company’s strong operating cash flow and improved profitability margins support dividend sustainability and potential for reinvestment. Overall, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD is positioned for continued financial stability and growth with prudent investment and financing strategies in 2023. |
