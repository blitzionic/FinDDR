# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD's revenue showed a strong upward trend from MYR 107,281 thousand in 2022 to MYR 149,681 thousand in 2023, and further to MYR 220,232 thousand in 2024, representing a compound growth momentum. Gross profit increased correspondingly from MYR 78,032 thousand in 2022 to MYR 104,797 thousand in 2023 and MYR 134,950 thousand in 2024. The gross margin improved steadily from 127.26% in 2022 to 129.99% in 2023 and reached 138.72% in 2024, indicating enhanced profitability on direct costs relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service reveals that supply, installation and maintenance services grew significantly from MYR 31,720 thousand in 2022 to MYR 54,665 thousand in 2023 and then to MYR 116,926 thousand in 2024, becoming the largest contributor in 2024. Digital infrastructure solutions also showed consistent growth from MYR 71,475 thousand in 2022 to MYR 99,934 thousand in 2024. Trading revenue and telecommunication/network infrastructure services remained minor contributors. Geographically, all revenue was generated in Malaysia, with revenue increasing from MYR 107,281 thousand in 2022 to MYR 220,232 thousand in 2024, indicating strong domestic market growth. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a declining trend from 54.92% in 2022 to 53.02% in 2023 and further down to 47.28% in 2024, suggesting some pressure on operating profitability despite revenue growth. Operating income increased from MYR 58,923 thousand in 2022 to MYR 79,357 thousand in 2023 and MYR 104,133 thousand in 2024, but at a slower rate relative to revenue growth, reflecting the margin compression. Operating expenses rose from MYR 19,696 thousand in 2022 to MYR 25,635 thousand in 2023 and MYR 34,106 thousand in 2024, indicating increased cost base possibly due to scaling operations or higher overheads. The ratio of operating income to revenue decreased, highlighting that cost management may need improvement to sustain margin levels amid rapid revenue expansion. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 27.93% in 2022 to 23.26% in 2023 and slightly increased to 24.91% in 2024, which positively impacted net profitability by reducing tax burden relative to pre-tax income. There are no explicitly listed non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability in the provided data. The steady tax rate reduction contributed to net profit growth from MYR 40,587 thousand in 2022 to MYR 80,507 thousand in 2024, supporting overall improved bottom-line performance. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD demonstrated solid financial health with total assets increasing to MYR 505,763 thousand from MYR 437,991 thousand in 2023, reflecting asset growth of approximately 15.4%.

The debt to equity ratio declined to 27.34% from 37.11%, reflecting a more conservative leverage position and stronger equity base. Overall, the company’s balance sheet in 2023 shows enhanced financial stability, strong equity growth, and prudent liability management. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD's revenue surged by 47.1% to MYR 220,232 thousand in 2024 from MYR 149,681 thousand in 2023, driven mainly by a doubling in supply, installation and maintenance services revenue (from MYR 54,665 thousand to MYR 116,926 thousand) and growth in digital infrastructure solutions (from MYR 91,133 thousand to MYR 99,934 thousand). Gross profit increased by 28.8% to MYR 134,950 thousand, with gross margin improving from 129.99% to 138.72%, indicating enhanced pricing power or product mix benefits. Operating income rose by 31.2% to MYR 104,133 thousand, though operating margin declined from 53.02% to 47.28%, suggesting higher operating expenses relative to revenue growth. Net profit increased by 27.3% to MYR 80,507 thousand, with net profit margin decreasing from 42.22% to 36.56%, reflecting the impact of increased operating expenses and higher effective tax rate (from 23.26% to 24.91%). Return on equity improved from 20.07% to 21.61%, and return on assets increased from 15.23% to 17.06%, both indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of capital. Interest expense decreased from MYR 4,334 thousand to MYR 3,012 thousand, improving interest coverage dramatically from 1831.03% to 3457.27%, underscoring strong earnings relative to interest costs. | ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD experienced robust profitability growth in 2023. Revenue increased significantly by approximately 39.5% to MYR 149,681 thousand from MYR 107,281 thousand in 2022. Gross profit rose to MYR 104,797 thousand, up 34.3%, supported by a slight improvement in gross margin to 129.99% from 127.26%, indicating effective cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. Operating income increased by 34.7% to MYR 79,357 thousand, though operating margin slightly decreased to 53.02% from 54.92%, suggesting a modest rise in operating expenses relative to sales. Net profit surged by 55.8% to MYR 63,196 thousand, with net profit margin improving to 42.22% from 37.83%, reflecting strong bottom-line growth and earnings quality. Income before taxes increased by 46.2% to MYR 82,348 thousand, while income tax expense rose moderately, resulting in a lower effective tax rate of 23.26% compared to 27.93% in 2022. Return on equity and return on assets were reported at 20.07% and 15.23% respectively, indicating efficient use of equity and assets to generate profits. Overall, the company’s profitability and earnings quality in 2023 improved markedly with strong revenue growth, margin stability, and enhanced returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD showed mixed efficiency trends in 2024. Cost of goods sold nearly doubled from MYR 44,884 thousand to MYR 85,282 thousand, consistent with revenue growth but resulting in a gross margin improvement, indicating effective cost management relative to sales. Operating expenses increased by 33.1% to MYR 34,106 thousand, outpacing revenue growth rate, which contributed to a decline in operating margin. Asset turnover improved significantly from 36.07% to 46.67%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories increased modestly from MYR 17,811 thousand to MYR 19,687 thousand, which is reasonable given the revenue expansion. Net cash from operations decreased by 13.7% to MYR 48,328 thousand, indicating some pressure on cash generation despite higher profits. Working capital increased as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, but the current ratio declined, suggesting tighter short-term liquidity management. Overall, while asset utilization and gross margin improved, rising operating expenses and reduced operational cash flow highlight areas for efficiency enhancement. | Operationally, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD showed improved efficiency in 2023. Cost of goods sold increased to MYR 44,884 thousand from MYR 29,249 thousand, but at a lower rate than revenue growth, supporting margin expansion. Operating expenses rose to MYR 25,635 thousand from MYR 19,696 thousand, reflecting increased investment in operations but maintaining a stable operating margin above 53%. Asset turnover was reported at 36.07%, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased significantly to MYR 55,985 thousand from MYR 41,297 thousand, demonstrating strong cash generation capability. Inventories more than doubled to MYR 17,811 thousand, which may suggest increased stockholding to support higher sales or potential inventory buildup risk. Working capital remains strong with a current ratio of 664.90%, indicating ample liquidity to cover short-term obligations. Cash flow from investing activities was negative at MYR (18,451) thousand, lower than the prior year, indicating reduced investment outflows. Overall, operational efficiency improved with strong cash flow from operations, effective asset use, and controlled cost increases, though inventory growth warrants monitoring. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for 2024 show a generally low risk profile for ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 26.00%, maintaining a low leverage position. Interest expense decreased by 30.5% to MYR 3,012 thousand, and interest coverage ratio more than doubled to 3457.27%, indicating very strong ability to service debt. The current ratio, while still very high at 452.33%, declined from 664.90%, signaling a reduction in liquidity buffer but remaining well above typical risk thresholds. The effective tax rate increased slightly from 23.26% to 24.91%, which may marginally impact net profitability but does not pose a significant risk. The significant increase in current liabilities (57.2%) relative to current assets (7.1%) warrants monitoring to ensure short-term obligations remain manageable. No other explicit financial risks such as negative cash flows or high leverage are evident. Overall, the company maintains a strong financial risk profile with ample liquidity and low leverage, though the rise in current liabilities and reduced cash from operations suggest cautious monitoring is advisable. | Financial risk indicators for 2023 show a generally low risk profile for ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 27.34%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk compared to 37.11% in 2022. Interest expense increased to MYR 4,334 thousand from MYR 2,864 thousand, but interest coverage remains very high at 1,831.03%, down slightly from 2,057.37% in 2022, suggesting strong ability to service interest obligations. The current ratio of 664.90% reflects excellent liquidity, minimizing short-term solvency risk. The effective tax rate declined to 23.26% from 27.93%, which may improve net profitability but also indicates a change in tax expense dynamics. The significant increase in inventories to MYR 17,811 thousand could pose a liquidity risk if not managed properly. The net cash from financing activities turned negative to MYR (31,911) thousand from a large positive inflow in 2022, indicating repayment or reduction of financing, which reduces financial risk. Overall, the company’s financial risk remains low with strong liquidity, reduced leverage, and robust interest coverage, though inventory levels and tax rate changes should be monitored. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD's future financial performance may face mixed pressures. The company invested heavily in 2024, with net cash used in investing activities rising sharply to MYR (60,487) thousand from MYR (18,451) thousand in 2023, indicating significant capital expenditure or acquisitions that could support future growth. However, net cash from operations declined by 13.7% to MYR 48,328 thousand, and net cash from financing activities also increased in outflow to MYR (45,472) thousand, reflecting higher dividend payments (from MYR 8,225 thousand to MYR 26,767 thousand) and possible debt repayments. The large dividend payout suggests a shareholder-friendly policy but may constrain internal cash reserves. Revenue concentration remains fully domestic (Malaysia), with no geographic diversification, which could limit growth opportunities or expose the company to regional economic risks. The product mix shows strong growth in supply, installation and maintenance services, which may continue to drive revenue. Given the strong asset base, improved profitability metrics, and ongoing investments, the company is positioned for sustainable growth, but cash flow sustainability and liquidity management will be critical to support ongoing operations and investments. | Looking ahead, ITMAX SYSTEM BERHAD’s future financial performance appears sustainable and positive. The company’s net cash from investing activities decreased to MYR (18,451) thousand from MYR (38,839) thousand in 2022, indicating a reduction in capital expenditures or investments, which may preserve cash flow. Net cash from financing activities was negative at MYR (31,911) thousand, reflecting debt repayment or reduced external financing, which strengthens the balance sheet and reduces financial risk. Dividend payments increased slightly to MYR (8,225) thousand, suggesting a stable or slightly enhanced dividend policy supporting shareholder returns. Revenue growth was driven primarily by digital infrastructure solutions and supply, installation and maintenance services, with the latter nearly doubling to MYR 54,665 thousand, indicating potential growth areas. All revenue was generated in Malaysia, suggesting geographic concentration risk but also market focus. The strong cash flow from operations and improved profitability margins support cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company is positioned for continued growth with prudent investment and financing strategies, stable dividend policy, and focus on expanding key service segments within its core geographic market. |
