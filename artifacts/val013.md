# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue increased from Rp9126.799bn in 2022 to Rp9245.0bn in 2023 (a modest growth of approximately 1.29%), then surged to Rp11187.6bn in 2024, representing a strong growth of 21.0% from 2023. Despite this revenue growth, the gross margin declined from 50.05% in 2022 to 49.31% in 2023 and further to 47.04% in 2024, indicating that the cost of goods sold increased at a faster rate than revenue. Specifically, COGS rose from Rp4559.218bn in 2022 to Rp4685.871bn in 2023 (+2.75%) and then sharply to Rp5925.03bn in 2024 (+26.56%). The product/service revenue breakdown in 2024 shows Real Estate as the dominant contributor with Rp8909.1bn (79.6% of total revenue), followed by Rental at Rp1424.9bn (12.7%) and Others at Rp853.6bn (7.6%). Compared to 2023, Real Estate revenue grew by 25.1%, Rental by 3.1%, and Others by 14.9%, indicating strong growth in the core Real Estate segment and moderate growth in ancillary services. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a declining trend from 33.56% in 2022 to 31.92% in 2023 and further to 30.81% in 2024, reflecting a slight deterioration in operating efficiency despite revenue growth. Operating income decreased from Rp3062.626bn in 2022 to Rp2951.4bn in 2023 (-3.65%) but rebounded to Rp3447.1bn in 2024 (+16.8% from 2023), though not proportionally to revenue growth. Operating expenses increased significantly from Rp1257.68bn in 2022 to Rp1767.7bn in 2023 (+40.5%) and further to Rp1956.6bn in 2024 (+10.7%), indicating rising costs that pressured operating margins. The increase in operating expenses outpaced revenue growth in 2023, suggesting cost management challenges, but the company managed to improve operating income in 2024 through higher revenue despite continued expense growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shows an anomalous spike in 2023 at 18999.95%, which is inconsistent with typical tax rates and likely reflects a non-recurring tax expense or accounting anomaly, given the income tax expense reported as Rp85446bn in 2023, which is disproportionately high relative to operating income and net profit. In contrast, the tax rate was a modest 2.76% in 2022 and normalized to 19.00% in 2024, aligning with typical corporate tax levels. This unusual tax expense in 2023 severely impacted net profit margin, which dropped from 21.94% in 2022 to 19.97% in 2023 and further to 19.01% in 2024. No other non-recurring items or external factors are explicitly reported, but the tax anomaly in 2023 significantly distorted profitability metrics for that year. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from Rp44,115.215 billion in 2023 to Rp47,022.7 billion, reflecting asset growth driven by both current assets (up from Rp25,747.833 billion to Rp26,429.775 billion) and non-current assets (up from Rp18,367.382 billion to Rp20,592.927 billion). Total liabilities rose moderately from Rp21,490.499 billion to Rp22,407.372 billion, with a notable increase in current liabilities (from Rp10,625.396 billion to Rp13,308.121 billion) offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities (from Rp10,865.103 billion to Rp9,099.251 billion). Shareholders' equity strengthened from Rp22,624.7 billion to Rp24,615.3 billion, supported by higher retained earnings (Rp13,617.304 billion vs Rp11,885.1 billion in 2023). Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 242.32% to 198.60%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity but still maintaining a comfortable buffer above 1. The debt to equity ratio improved slightly from 94.99% to 91.03%, suggesting prudent liability management and a stable capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth with manageable leverage and a strong equity base in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from Rp42,032.615 billion in 2022 to Rp44,115.215 billion, reflecting asset growth primarily driven by current assets rising from Rp23,733.907 billion to Rp25,747.833 billion. Non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities increased slightly from Rp21,017.685 billion to Rp21,490.499 billion, with a notable rise in non-current liabilities (Rp10,865.103 billion vs. Rp10,208.648 billion) while current liabilities decreased marginally. Shareholders' equity improved from Rp21,014.9 billion to Rp22,624.7 billion, supported by an increase in retained earnings from Rp10,317.0 billion to Rp11,885.1 billion, indicating strengthened equity base. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio rising from 219.57% to 242.32%, suggesting enhanced short-term financial stability. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 100.01% to 94.99%, indicating a modest reduction in leverage and a more balanced capital structure. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company experienced robust revenue growth in 2024, increasing by approximately 21% from Rp9,245.0 billion in 2023 to Rp11,187.6 billion. Gross profit rose to Rp5,262.5 billion from Rp4,559.2 billion, though the gross margin declined from 49.31% to 47.04%, indicating some pressure on cost of goods sold which increased proportionally more. Operating income increased to Rp3,447.1 billion from Rp2,951.4 billion, but operating margin slightly decreased from 31.92% to 30.81%, reflecting higher operating expenses (Rp1,956.6 billion vs Rp1,767.7 billion). Net profit improved to Rp2,126.3 billion from Rp1,846.1 billion, with a net profit margin marginally lower at 19.01% compared to 19.97% in 2023. Return on equity increased from 8.46% to 9.00%, and return on assets improved from 4.29% to 4.67%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate normalized to 19.00% in 2024 from an anomalous 18,999.95% in 2023, improving earnings sustainability. Overall, profitability improved in absolute terms with slight margin compression but better returns on capital. | Revenue in 2023 increased slightly to Rp9,245.0 billion from Rp9,126.799 billion in 2022, but gross profit marginally declined to Rp4,559.2 billion from Rp4,567.581 billion, resulting in a lower gross margin of 49.31% compared to 50.05% in 2022. Operating expenses rose significantly by approximately 40.5% to Rp1,767.7 billion, which contributed to a decrease in operating income to Rp2,951.4 billion from Rp3,062.626 billion, and a reduced operating margin of 31.92% from 33.56%. Net profit declined to Rp1,846.1 billion from Rp2,002.076 billion, with net profit margin falling to 19.97% from 21.94%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 8.46% and 4.29% respectively, indicating moderate profitability and earnings sustainability. However, the effective tax rate spiked dramatically to 18,999.95% from 2.76%, which appears anomalous and may reflect accounting or reporting irregularities affecting earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed trends in 2024. The operating margin slightly decreased to 30.81% from 31.92% in 2023, indicating some cost pressure despite revenue growth. Asset turnover improved significantly from 21.46% to 24.55%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations declined from Rp3,864.8 billion to Rp2,985.5 billion, suggesting potential challenges in converting earnings into cash or changes in working capital management. Inventories increased modestly from Rp12,119.621 billion to Rp12,537.622 billion, which may impact working capital efficiency. The current ratio decreased from 242.32% to 198.60%, indicating reduced liquidity but still a strong position. Overall, while asset utilization improved, cash flow from operations weakened, highlighting areas for potential operational cash management improvement. | Operating efficiency showed some challenges in 2023. Despite a slight increase in revenue, the cost of goods sold rose to Rp4,685.871 billion from Rp4,559.218 billion, compressing gross profit. Operating expenses increased substantially, negatively impacting operating margin. Asset turnover was reported at 21.46, indicating high utilization of assets to generate revenue, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations improved slightly to Rp3,864.8 billion from Rp3,759.3 billion, supporting operational cash flow strength. Inventories increased moderately to Rp12,119.621 billion from Rp11,641.082 billion, which may suggest higher stock levels. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, consistent with the improved current ratio. Overall, cost control appears weaker given rising operating expenses, but asset utilization and cash flow from operations remain solid. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 suggest moderate leverage and stable liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved slightly to 91.03% from 94.99%, indicating a marginal reduction in financial leverage. Interest expense increased from Rp1,208.8 billion to Rp1,359.2 billion, but interest coverage ratio improved from 244.16% to 253.61%, showing strong ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate normalized to 19.00% from an extremely high 18,999.95% in 2023, reducing tax-related risk. Current liabilities increased significantly, which, combined with a lower current ratio, may signal some short-term liquidity pressure. The net cash from financing activities decreased in outflow from Rp1,140.2 billion to Rp634.5 billion, indicating less reliance on external financing. Overall, the company maintains a manageable risk profile with strong interest coverage and improving leverage, though short-term liquidity should be monitored. | Financial risk indicators show a mixed picture in 2023. Leverage decreased slightly with debt to equity ratio falling to 94.99% from 100.01%, indicating a modest reduction in financial risk. Interest expense increased to Rp1,208.8 billion from Rp1,069.334 billion, while interest coverage ratio declined to 244.16% from 286.40%, reflecting reduced but still comfortable ability to cover interest obligations. Liquidity improved as current ratio rose to 242.32%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. The effective tax rate's extreme increase to 18,999.95% is a significant red flag, suggesting potential tax-related risks or accounting anomalies that could impact future earnings and cash flows. The large discrepancy between income before taxes (Rp449.717 billion) and income tax expense (Rp85,446 billion) further underscores this concern. Overall, while leverage and liquidity are stable, tax and earnings quality risks warrant close monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities intensified in 2024, with net cash used in investing activities increasing substantially from Rp1,176.3 billion outflow to Rp2,751.2 billion outflow, signaling aggressive capital expenditure or acquisitions to support growth. Despite this, net cash from operations declined, and the company recorded a net decrease in cash of Rp400.2 billion compared to a net increase in 2023, indicating potential cash flow sustainability challenges. Dividend payments increased significantly from Rp278.035 billion to Rp389.25 billion, reflecting confidence in earnings but also higher cash outflows. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the Real Estate segment, which increased from Rp7,120.6 billion to Rp8,909.1 billion, while Rental and Other segments showed modest growth. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. Overall, the company is investing heavily for future growth with strong revenue drivers but must manage cash flow carefully to sustain dividend policy and operational needs. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 as net cash from investing outflows increased to Rp1,176.3 billion from Rp722.4 billion, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing remained negative at Rp1,140.2 billion, slightly improved from Rp1,169.6 billion, suggesting ongoing debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends increased to Rp278.035 billion from Rp259.5 billion, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue concentration in 2023 was primarily in Real Estate (Rp7,120.6 billion), followed by Rental (Rp1,381.7 billion) and Others (Rp742.7 billion), indicating a focus on core segments without geographic revenue data available. The stable asset base, improved liquidity, and ongoing investments suggest potential for sustained growth, but profitability pressures and tax anomalies may constrain near-term performance. Cash flow from operations remains robust, supporting dividend policy and investment plans. |

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The global economy in 2024 faced high uncertainty and rapid dynamics, marked by geopolitical tensions such as the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict and Israel-Palestine attacks, which worsened global market sentiment and economic resilience. Global growth slowed to 3.2%, with weakening demand and protectionist trade policies, especially in Europe and China, creating uncertainty among investors and disrupting international trade relations. Inflation remained controlled in Indonesia at below 2%, but the year was politically sensitive, potentially creating domestic uncertainty. The Indonesian property sector experienced rising construction costs, licensing issues, and fluctuating interest rates, which affected property development and sales, particularly for small and medium-sized houses. The company also faces financial risks including foreign currency fluctuations, interest rate volatility primarily from floating rate bank loans, liquidity risks due to cash flow deficits, and credit risks from potential defaults. Additionally, rising operating expenses, including sales and administrative costs, pose cost pressures. Despite these challenges, Indonesia's economy showed resilience with stable growth around 5%, supported by strong household consumption and investment, and government incentives such as VAT incentives (PPN DTP) continue to support the property sector. | The global economy in 2023 remained challenging due to lingering geopolitical tensions from the Russia-Ukraine war and Middle East conflicts, which disrupted global trade. Additional factors included the El Nino phenomenon and climate change causing rises in global food commodity prices and inflation, impacting monetary policies worldwide and maintaining high global economic uncertainty. The World Bank reported global economic growth at 2.6% in 2023. Domestically, Indonesia's economy remained solid with consistent growth above 5% year-on-year for seven consecutive quarters, supported by strong domestic demand, stable and controlled inflation, high consumer optimism, and strengthened investment activity aided by government fiscal policies. However, Indonesia remains vulnerable to external risks such as geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East and fluctuations in global financial markets. The political year 2024 also introduces specific risks, though no significant changes in overall economic policy are projected. The property industry globally showed no significant recovery in 2023 due to low demand from rising interest rates and weakened economic activity, but these conditions did not directly affect Indonesia's domestic property industry, which benefited from government stimulus policies including VAT incentives and mortgage loan relaxations. The company anticipates housing sales growth of 5% to 10% in 2024, supported by government incentives and stable macroeconomic conditions. Cost pressures are implied by increased operating expenses, including higher salaries and administrative costs, reflecting a return to normal operations post-COVID-19. Interest rate risk remains a concern due to exposure to floating rate bank loans, though sensitivity has decreased due to debt structure optimization. Foreign currency risk exists but is considered limited. Overall, economic uncertainties include geopolitical tensions, global market fluctuations, climate-related commodity price increases, and interest rate volatility that could impact revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Indonesian property industry is highly fragmented with many players, creating a competitive market environment. The company estimates holding at least a 10% market share, indicating a relatively strong but contested position. Competitive pressures arise from both established industry players and new entrants, requiring continuous innovation, adaptation, and diversification of business to maintain market leadership. The company emphasizes leveraging its strong brand reputation, extensive project portfolio across 34 cities, and experienced management to sustain competitive advantages. It also focuses on digital transformation and marketing strategies, including digital marketing initiatives and virtual tours, to enhance customer engagement and respond swiftly to market changes.

To mitigate competitive risks, the company pursues geographic diversification, targets upper-middle and higher market segments, accelerates construction to meet demand, and invests in sustainable innovation and technology development. Maintaining prudent capital management and liquidity is also critical to withstand competitive and market pressures. | The property industry in Indonesia is characterized by a fragmented market with many players, indicating intense competition.
