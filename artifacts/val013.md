# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 was modest, increasing from 9,126,799 to 9,245,032, representing a growth of 1.29%. However, there was a significant increase in revenue from 2023 to 2024, rising to 11,187,565, which is a growth of 20.93%. The gross margin showed a slight decline from 48.66% in 2022 to 49.31% in 2023, but further decreased to 47.04% in 2024, indicating rising costs relative to revenue. In terms of product/service revenue, Real Estate saw a substantial increase from Rp7,120.6 billion in 2023 to Rp8,909.1 billion in 2024, while Rental and Others also experienced growth, indicating a positive trend in the core business areas. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin has been on a downward trend, decreasing from 33.56% in 2022 to 31.92% in 2023, and further to 30.81% in 2024.

The operating income, while increasing from 3,062,626 in 2022 to 3,447,050 in 2024, reflects the challenges in maintaining efficiency as revenue growth outpaces the increase in operating income. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed a slight increase from 2.47% in 2022 to 2.65% in 2023, and then decreased to 2.43% in 2024, indicating some fluctuations but overall stability in tax obligations.

External factors affecting profitability are not detailed, but the significant revenue growth in 2024 may suggest a recovery or expansion in market conditions. |

| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The global economy in 2024 faced high uncertainty and rapid dynamics, marked by geopolitical tensions from the prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which worsened global market sentiment. The situation deteriorated further with Israel's attacks on Palestine, leading to protests worldwide. This instability placed significant pressure on global markets, weakening economic resilience and hampering growth. Global economic growth was recorded at 3.2%, down from 3.3% the previous year. The U.S. economy remained stable, driven by strong consumer spending, while Europe and China experienced slowdowns due to weakening domestic demand and protectionist trade policies. In Indonesia, despite these global challenges, the economy showed resilience with a growth rate of 5.03%, supported by household consumption and investment, although the political year introduced potential uncertainties. | The year 2023 remains a challenging year for the global economy, with high global economic uncertainty due to geopolitical tensions from the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the El Nino phenomenon and climate change causing increases in global food commodity prices and inflation. This inflation affects monetary policy in many countries. Domestically, Indonesia's economic fundamentals remain solid, with growth above 5% for seven consecutive quarters, but there are vulnerabilities to external risks, including geopolitical tensions and fluctuations in global financial markets. The property industry globally has not shown significant recovery due to low demand from rising interest rates and weakening economic activity, although domestic conditions are more optimistic due to government support and fiscal policies. |
