# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Ciputra Development Tbk's revenue shows a strong upward trend from IDR 9,126,799 million in 2022 to IDR 9,245,032 million in 2023, and further to IDR 11,187,565 million in 2024, indicating robust growth. However, the gross margin declined from 61.27% in 2022 to 61.42% in 2023 and then decreased more noticeably to 57.85% in 2024, suggesting rising cost pressures or changes in product mix. Revenue by product/service reveals that Real Estate remains the dominant contributor, increasing from IDR 7,187,649 million in 2022 to IDR 8,909,131 million in 2024, while Rental and Others also grew but at a slower pace. Geographically, all revenue is reported from Indonesia in 2023 and 2024, indicating a concentrated market focus within the country. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin shows a declining trend from 33.56% in 2022 to 31.92% in 2023 and further down to 30.81% in 2024, reflecting slightly reduced operating efficiency despite revenue growth. Operating income increased from IDR 3,062,626 million in 2022 to IDR 3,441,050 million in 2024, but not proportionally to revenue growth, indicating rising operating expenses. Operating expenses rose from IDR 1,640,849 million in 2022 to IDR 1,956,600 million in 2024, which suggests cost management challenges as expenses grew faster than revenue in percentage terms, impacting operating profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable and low, fluctuating slightly from 2.47% in 2022 to 2.65% in 2023 and then decreasing to 2.43% in 2024, which positively supports net profitability by minimizing tax burden. There are no explicitly listed non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability in the provided data, indicating that the profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance rather than one-off events or external shocks. |

This growth was supported by increases in both current assets (up 2.6%) and non-current assets (up 12.1%).

The debt to equity ratio improved slightly from 94.99% to 91.03%, suggesting a modest deleveraging and a stable capital structure.

| Profitability and earnings quality | The company’s revenue increased significantly by 21% from IDR 9,245,032 million in 2023 to IDR 11,187,565 million in 2024, driven mainly by the Real Estate segment which grew by 25.1%. Gross profit rose by 15.5% to IDR 5,262,535 million, though the gross margin declined from 61.42% to 57.85%, indicating some margin pressure possibly due to higher cost of goods sold which increased by 32.3%.

Net profit improved by 15.2% to IDR 2,126,288 million, but net profit margin decreased marginally from 19.97% to 19.01%.

| Operational efficiency | Operationally, the company showed increased revenue generation efficiency with asset turnover rising from 21.46% to 24.55%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate sales. Operating expenses increased by 10.7% to IDR 1,956,600 million, which is lower than the revenue growth rate, suggesting reasonable cost control. Inventories increased modestly by 3.5% to IDR 12,537,622 million, consistent with business expansion. Net cash from operations decreased from IDR 3,864.8 million in 2023 to IDR 2,985.5 million in 2024, indicating some reduction in cash generation efficiency despite higher profits, which may reflect changes in working capital or collection cycles. The increase in current liabilities and decrease in current ratio also suggest tighter working capital management. Cash flow from investing activities showed a higher outflow (IDR -2,751.2 million) compared to the prior year, indicating increased investment spending. Financing cash outflows decreased, reflecting lower net borrowing or repayments. Overall, the company improved asset utilization and controlled operating costs well but faces challenges in converting earnings into cash flow. | Cost control showed mixed results; cost of goods sold increased slightly to IDR 3,566,755 million, but gross margin remained stable, indicating effective cost management relative to revenue. Operating expenses rose to IDR 1,767,700 million from IDR 1,640,849 million, contributing to a slight decline in operating margin. Asset turnover was high at 21.46, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Inventories increased moderately to IDR 12,119,621 million, consistent with business scale. Net cash from operations improved slightly to IDR 3,864.8 million from IDR 3,759.3 million, supporting operational cash flow strength. Working capital remained robust with current assets exceeding current liabilities, reflected in an improved current ratio. Cash flow from investing activities showed increased outflows at IDR (1,176.3) million, indicating higher investment spending. Financing cash outflows remained stable. Overall, operational efficiency was maintained with strong cash generation and effective asset utilization despite rising expenses. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show a stable leverage profile with debt to equity ratio improving to 91.03% from 94.99%, reducing financial risk slightly. Interest expense increased by 12.5% to IDR 1,359,173 million, but interest coverage ratio improved from 244.17% to 253.61%, indicating strong ability to service debt from operating income. The current ratio declined to 198.60% but remains well above 100%, suggesting adequate liquidity despite increased current liabilities. The effective tax rate decreased slightly to 2.43%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax regulations but does not pose immediate risk. The increase in current liabilities by 25.3% relative to current assets growth of 2.6% could signal potential short-term liquidity pressure if not managed carefully. No other explicit risks such as impairments or unusual expenses are noted. Overall, the company maintains a manageable financial risk profile with strong interest coverage but should monitor short-term liquidity closely. | Leverage indicators show a slight improvement with debt to equity ratio decreasing to 94.99% from 100.01%, reducing financial risk marginally. Interest expense increased to IDR 1,208,782 million from IDR 1,069,334 million, while interest coverage ratio declined from 286.40% to 244.17%, indicating reduced but still comfortable ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate rose slightly to 2.65%, with income tax expense increasing significantly to IDR 58,618 million. Current liabilities decreased slightly, improving liquidity risk profile. The high asset turnover and strong current ratio mitigate liquidity risk. However, the increase in non-current liabilities to IDR 10,865,103 million warrants monitoring. Overall, financial risk remains moderate with manageable leverage and adequate interest coverage, but rising interest expenses and liabilities require attention. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company’s increased investment outflows in 2024 (net cash from investing at IDR -2,751.2 million, more than double the prior year) suggest ongoing capital expenditure or asset acquisitions, which may support future growth. The dividend payout increased substantially from IDR 278,035,000,000 in 2023 to IDR 389,250,000,000 in 2024, indicating a shareholder-friendly policy and confidence in cash flow sustainability despite lower net cash from operations. Revenue growth concentrated entirely in Indonesia and primarily in the Real Estate segment suggests geographic and segment focus continuity, with potential for further expansion domestically. The improved return on equity and asset turnover support positive future earnings prospects. However, the decline in operating cash flow and increased current liabilities highlight the need for careful liquidity and working capital management to sustain growth and dividend payments. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued growth with active investment and shareholder returns, balanced by cautious cash flow management. | Investment activity increased as evidenced by higher net cash outflows from investing at IDR (1,176.3) million, suggesting ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions to support growth. Net cash from operations remained strong and slightly improved, indicating sustainable cash flow generation to fund operations and investments. Dividend payments increased to IDR 278,035,000,000 from IDR 259,500,000,000, reflecting a shareholder-friendly dividend policy and confidence in future earnings. Revenue growth was driven by rental segment increasing to IDR 1,381,714 million from IDR 1,229,410 million, while real estate revenue slightly declined, signaling potential shifts in business focus or market demand. Geographic revenue concentration remains fully in Indonesia, indicating exposure to domestic market conditions. Overall, the company appears positioned for stable future performance supported by solid cash flows, ongoing investments, and a balanced dividend approach, though monitoring segment trends and geographic concentration is advisable. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces economic challenges stemming from global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, including prolonged conflicts such as Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine, which have weakened global market sentiment and economic resilience. Although Indonesia's economy showed stable growth around 5%, potential political uncertainties in 2024 and fluctuating market conditions remain concerns. Inflation in Indonesia remained low below 2%, but rising construction costs, licensing issues, and interest rates impact property development and sales, particularly affecting small and medium-type residential properties. The Company also manages risks related to foreign currency fluctuations, interest rate changes, and liquidity constraints, which could affect financial performance. Market conditions such as supply and demand fluctuations, raw material price volatility, and global economic dynamics pose risks to operations and profitability. The Company mitigates these through prudent capital management, diversification, and innovation but acknowledges that economic challenges and turbulence are inevitable and require continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies. | The 2023 annual report highlights several economic challenges and uncertainties impacting PT Ciputra Development Tbk. Globally, the economy faced ongoing challenges from geopolitical tensions such as the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East, which disrupted global trade. Climate phenomena like El Nino and climate change caused increases in global food commodity prices and inflation, influencing monetary policies worldwide and maintaining high global economic uncertainty. Domestically, while Indonesia's economic fundamentals remained solid with consistent GDP growth above 5%, the country remains vulnerable to external risks including geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East and fluctuations in global financial markets. The political year 2024 also introduces specific risks, although no significant changes in overall economic policy are projected. Inflation and GDP per capita are expected to remain relatively stable, supported by improving labor market conditions and recovering investor sentiment. The property industry is projected to grow, aided by government incentives such as VAT incentives and relaxed Loan to Value/Financing to Value (LTV/FTV) ratios for mortgage loans. However, challenges include the limited and irreplaceable availability of land, requiring prudent land bank management and selective acquisitions. Rising interest rates and weakening economic activity globally have restrained property demand, although these have not directly affected the domestic property market. Cost pressures are evident with increased operating expenses, including salaries and administrative costs, partly due to normalization post-COVID-19. Financial risks include exposure to interest rate fluctuations on variable rate borrowings and foreign currency risks, which the Company manages through hedging and balanced funding strategies. Overall, economic uncertainties from global geopolitical tensions, climate impacts, and financial market volatility pose ongoing challenges to business performance and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Indonesian property industry is highly fragmented with many players, creating a competitive market environment. The Company estimates holding at least a 10% market share, indicating a strong but contested position. Competitive pressures arise from established industry players and new entrants, requiring the Company to continuously innovate, adapt, and diversify its product portfolio across residential, commercial, and other property segments. The Company leverages its strong brand reputation, extensive project portfolio across 34 cities, and experienced management to maintain market leadership. Digital transformation and marketing initiatives, including digital marketing and virtual tours, are employed to enhance competitiveness. The Company also faces challenges from fluctuating market demand, pricing pressures, and the need to meet evolving customer preferences, necessitating ongoing innovation and strategic geographic diversification to sustain its competitive edge. | The report indicates that the Indonesian property industry is highly fragmented with many players, reflecting a developing market with widespread property distribution.

The Company focuses on product segmentation aligned with its strengths, targeting resilient end-users in the middle to upper-income segments, particularly in landed residential and commercial properties. Digital marketing initiatives and innovative product launches are key strategies to maintain competitiveness. The Company also pursues joint operation schemes to expand its project portfolio. Changing consumer behavior, such as mall visitors prioritizing experience over shopping and the impact of work-from-home trends, affects retail property dynamics, requiring careful mall development strategies. Technological disruption is addressed through digital marketing and IT risk management to ensure safe and effective use of technology. The Company maintains prudent capital management and liquidity to sustain competitive positioning. While specific threats from new disruptive entrants are not explicitly detailed, the emphasis on innovation, digital capabilities, and strategic partnerships with leading property management and retail operators suggests proactive responses to competitive challenges in the industry. |
