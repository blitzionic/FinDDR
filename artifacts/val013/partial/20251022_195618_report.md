# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Ciputra Development Tbk's revenue showed a consistent upward trend from IDR 9,126,799 million in 2022 to IDR 9,245,032 million in 2023, and further to IDR 11,187,565 million in 2024, representing a significant growth especially in 2024. However, the gross margin declined from 50.31% in 2022 to 49.31% in 2023 and further to 47.04% in 2024, indicating that cost of goods sold increased at a faster rate than revenue. Revenue by product/service in 2024 was predominantly from Real Estate at IDR 8,909,131 million, followed by Rental at IDR 1,424,881 million and Others at IDR 853,553 million. In 2023, Real Estate contributed IDR 7,120,570 million and Rental IDR 2,124,462 million. Geographically, all revenue was generated from Indonesia across the three years, with an increase from IDR 9,126,799 million in 2022 to IDR 11,187,565 million in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a declining trend from 33.56% in 2022 to 31.92% in 2023 and further to 30.81% in 2024, reflecting a slight decrease in operating efficiency despite revenue growth. Operating income increased from IDR 3,062,626 million in 2022 to IDR 3,441,050 million in 2024, but this increase was proportionally less than the revenue growth, consistent with the margin decline. Operating expenses rose from IDR 1,640,800 million in 2022 to IDR 1,956,600 million in 2024, indicating increased cost pressures. The company managed costs with some discipline but the rising operating expenses relative to revenue growth contributed to the margin compression. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 4.27% in 2022 to 2.98% in 2023 and further to 2.75% in 2024, which positively impacted net profitability by reducing tax expenses relative to pre-tax income. Income tax expense decreased from IDR 98,620 million in 2022 to IDR 65,863 million in 2024 despite higher operating income, reflecting the lower tax rate. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Ciputra Development Tbk demonstrated an overall strengthening in financial health. Total assets increased from IDR 44,115,215 million in 2023 to IDR 47,022,702 million, driven by growth in both current assets (from IDR 25,747,833 million to IDR 26,429,775 million) and non-current assets (from IDR 18,367,382 million to IDR 20,592,927 million).

Overall, the company’s financial position in 2024 shows asset growth, equity strengthening, and manageable liabilities, though with some pressure on liquidity ratios. | In 2023, PT Ciputra Development Tbk demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing to IDR 44,115,215 million from IDR 42,032,615 million in 2022, reflecting asset growth of approximately 4.9%.

Shareholders' equity grew by 7.7% to IDR 22,624,716 million, driven by higher retained earnings. The current ratio improved significantly from 219.57% to 242.32%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 100.01% to 94.99%, suggesting a slight reduction in leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company maintained a balanced and improving financial health profile in 2023 with increased equity base and liquidity alongside controlled liabilities. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | PT Ciputra Development Tbk’s profitability in 2024 improved in absolute terms with revenue rising by approximately 21% to IDR 11,187,565 million from IDR 9,245,032 million in 2023. Gross profit increased to IDR 5,262,535 million from IDR 4,559,161 million, though the gross margin declined from 49.31% to 47.04%, indicating slightly higher cost of goods sold relative to sales. Operating income rose to IDR 3,447,050 million from IDR 2,951,424 million, but operating margin decreased marginally from 31.92% to 30.81%. Net profit increased to IDR 2,126,288 million from IDR 1,846,087 million, with net profit margin slightly down from 19.97% to 19.01%. Return on equity improved from 8.46% to 9.00%, and return on assets increased from 4.29% to 4.67%, reflecting enhanced efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets. The effective tax rate remained low and slightly decreased from 2.98% to 2.75%, supporting net profitability. Interest coverage ratio improved from 244.16% to 253.61%, indicating strong earnings relative to interest expense despite an increase in interest expense. Overall, earnings quality remains solid with growth in profits and returns, though margins show slight compression. | Revenue in 2023 increased marginally by 1.3% to IDR 9,245,032 million from IDR 9,126,799 million in 2022. However, gross profit slightly declined to IDR 4,559,161 million from IDR 4,567,581 million, causing the gross margin to decrease from 50.31% to 49.31%. Operating income fell by 3.6% to IDR 2,951,424 million, with operating margin contracting from 33.56% to 31.92%, reflecting higher operating expenses. Net profit decreased slightly by 0.9% to IDR 1,846,087 million, with net profit margin declining from 20.41% to 19.97%. The effective tax rate dropped significantly from 4.27% to 2.98%, which partially cushioned the decline in income before taxes that fell by 14.8% to IDR 1,967,643 million. Return on equity and return on assets were reported for 2023 at 8.46% and 4.29% respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and assets. Overall, profitability showed slight erosion in margins and earnings quality, despite stable revenue growth. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, the company showed mixed efficiency trends in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased in line with revenue, but the gross margin contraction suggests some cost pressure. Operating expenses rose from IDR 1,767,700 million to IDR 1,956,600 million, a controlled increase relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover improved from 21.46% to 24.55%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations declined significantly from IDR 3,864,820 million in 2023 to IDR 2,985,452 million in 2024, signaling potential challenges in converting earnings into cash or changes in working capital management. Inventories increased moderately from IDR 12,119,600 million to IDR 12,537,600 million, which may impact working capital efficiency. The current ratio decrease also points to tighter liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities showed a larger outflow (IDR -2,751,166 million vs. IDR -1,176,280 million), indicating increased investment spending. Financing cash outflows decreased, reflecting lower net borrowing or repayments. Overall, while asset utilization improved, cash flow from operations and liquidity metrics suggest some operational cash management challenges. | Cost of goods sold increased by 3.3% to IDR 4,685,871 million, outpacing revenue growth and contributing to a slight gross margin decline. Operating expenses rose by 7.7% to IDR 1,767,700 million, indicating some cost pressure. Asset turnover was reported at 21.46%, reflecting efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations improved by 2.8% to IDR 3,864,820 million, supporting operational cash flow strength. Inventories increased by 4.1% to IDR 12,119,600 million, which may indicate higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Working capital remained strong with current liabilities slightly decreasing and current assets increasing, contributing to a higher current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency showed moderate cost increases but was supported by improved cash flow and asset utilization. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a moderate risk profile with some early warning signs. The debt to equity ratio improved slightly to 91.03% from 94.99%, indicating a modest reduction in leverage but still a relatively high gearing level. The current ratio declined to 198.60% from 242.32%, reflecting reduced short-term liquidity, though still above 1. Interest expense increased from IDR 1,208,800 million to IDR 1,359,173 million, but the interest coverage ratio improved to 253.61% from 244.16%, showing strong ability to service debt from operating income. The effective tax rate decreased slightly to 2.75%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment but does not pose immediate risk. The significant increase in current liabilities (from IDR 10,625,396 million to IDR 13,308,121 million) relative to current assets growth may pressure liquidity. The decline in net cash from operations and negative net cash flow in 2024 (-IDR 400,246 million) also raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. Overall, while leverage and interest coverage remain manageable, liquidity tightening and cash flow declines warrant monitoring. | Leverage indicators improved with debt to equity ratio decreasing to 94.99% from 100.01%, signaling reduced financial risk. However, interest expense increased by 13.0% to IDR 1,208,800 million, while interest coverage ratio declined from 286.41% to 244.16%, indicating a reduced but still comfortable ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate dropped to 2.98%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially impacting future tax liabilities. Current ratio increased to 242.32%, showing strong liquidity and low short-term solvency risk. No significant red flags in cash flow from financing or investing activities were observed, though net cash used in investing increased, which could affect liquidity if sustained. Overall, financial risk remains moderate with improving leverage but some pressure from rising interest expenses. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, PT Ciputra Development Tbk’s increased investment outflows in 2024 (net cash from investing at -IDR 2,751,166 million, more than double 2023’s outflow) suggest a focus on growth and asset expansion, which may support future revenue increases. The company’s revenue diversification in 2024 includes a new 'Others' segment contributing IDR 853,553 million, alongside real estate and rental, indicating potential new business lines or geographic expansion within Indonesia, where all revenue is currently concentrated. Dividend payments increased to IDR 389,250 million from IDR 278,035 million, reflecting a shareholder-friendly policy and confidence in cash flow sustainability despite the negative net cash flow. However, the decline in net cash from operations and the negative net cash flow in 2024 highlight the need for careful cash management to sustain operations and investments. The improved asset turnover and profitability ratios support a positive outlook, but liquidity and working capital management will be critical. Overall, the company appears positioned for growth with ongoing investments and stable profitability, but must manage cash flow and liquidity risks prudently. | Investment activity intensified in 2023 as net cash used in investing increased to IDR (1,176,280) million from IDR (722,420) million in 2022, indicating ongoing or expanded capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from operations remained strong and increased, supporting cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments were stable at IDR 278,035 million, suggesting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue by segment shifted with real estate revenue slightly decreasing but rental income increasing, indicating diversification within core operations. Geographic revenue remained concentrated entirely in Indonesia, implying exposure to domestic market conditions. The company’s strong liquidity, moderate leverage, and ongoing investments suggest capacity for sustained growth, though margin pressures and rising interest costs warrant monitoring. Overall, the outlook points to continued operational expansion supported by solid cash flows and prudent financial management. |

Global economic growth slowed to 3.2% in 2024. The US economy remained stable, but Europe and China experienced slowdowns due to weakening domestic demand and protectionist trade policies, including high US tariffs, creating investor uncertainty and worsening international trade relations. Domestically, Indonesia showed resilience with 5.03% economic growth supported by controlled inflation below 2%, strong household consumption growth of 4.94%, and increased investment of 4.61%. However, 2024 was a political year, potentially creating uncertainty.
