| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The property industry in Indonesia in 2024 faces significant economic challenges, primarily due to a combination of rising inflation and increasing interest rates. The benchmark interest rate was raised by Bank Indonesia to 6.25%, leading to higher borrowing costs, including mortgage loans, which could reduce consumer purchasing power. Additionally, ongoing inflation has driven up the prices of building materials and project operations, creating a difficult environment for developers who must balance profitability with consumer attraction. The declining demand for mortgages and apartment ownership loans is also a notable challenge, as higher borrowing costs deter potential buyers. Furthermore, global economic instability, exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts and potential trade wars, poses risks to domestic economic growth, potentially leading to decreased purchasing power and increased poverty. | The Company faces significant economic challenges in 2023, including rising BI interest rates, which have increased to 6% due to two consecutive hikes of 25 basis points. This rise in interest rates affects property demand as most purchases are financed through KPR or KPA loans, making property installments more expensive. Additionally, global economic conditions are deteriorating, with growth expected to slow to 3.0% due to geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions, and high inflation driven by rising energy and food prices. These factors have led to decreased purchasing power, increased poverty, and heightened risks of an economic crisis in Indonesia. The Company is responding by enhancing risk management practices and being cautious in its expansion plans. |

This heightened competition necessitates continuous innovation and the offering of attractive, value-added products to maintain market share. The company must also navigate technological disruptions and evolving industry dynamics, which challenge its market position.

The upcoming political year in 2024 is expected to bring fluctuations in the economy and property demand, which could intensify competition. The Company is focusing on maintaining its market share through strategic diversification and enhancing stability via recurring revenue streams. It is also adapting to technological advancements and regulatory changes that impact property demand and sales, ensuring that its strategies remain relevant in a dynamic market environment. |
