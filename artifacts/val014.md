# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT BUMI SERPONG DAMAI TBK's revenue showed a strong upward trend from IDR 10,235,479,955,727 in 2022 to IDR 11,539,141,250,155 in 2023, and further to IDR 13,796,572,148,837 in 2024, reflecting robust growth. Gross margin declined from 66.69% in 2022 to 55.56% in 2023 but rebounded to 63.90% in 2024, indicating improved cost control after a dip. Revenue by product/service highlights Real Estate as the dominant contributor, increasing from approximately IDR 7.29 trillion (land and buildings) in 2022 to IDR 12.37 trillion in 2024, with significant contributions also from Toll road services which grew from IDR 11.66 billion in 2022 to IDR 689.12 billion in 2024. Other segments like Property and Hotel showed growth or introduction in 2024, while geographic revenue is concentrated in major Indonesian urban centers such as Jabodetabek, Semarang, and Surabaya from 2023 onwards, though exact regional revenue figures are not provided. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 36.20% in 2022 to 25.22% in 2023 but improved to 32.39% in 2024, mirroring the gross margin trend and suggesting enhanced operational efficiency in 2024. Operating income increased substantially from IDR 3,705,009,673,794 in 2022 to IDR 4,468,905,803,578 in 2024, while operating expenses rose from IDR 3,121,030,668,038 in 2022 to IDR 4,347,479,661,584 in 2024. The increase in operating expenses was proportionally less than revenue growth, indicating effective cost management. The operating income as a percentage of revenue improved in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting better leverage of revenue growth to profitability despite higher absolute operating expenses. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased modestly from 0.18% in 2022 to 0.45% in 2023 and 0.56% in 2024, exerting a slight downward pressure on net profitability but remaining very low overall. Income tax expense rose from IDR 4.81 in 2022 to IDR 27,731,890,354 in 2024, consistent with higher pre-tax profits. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, indicating that the profitability trends primarily reflect operational performance rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT BUMI SERPONG DAMAI TBK demonstrated solid financial health with total assets increasing from 66,827,649 IDR in 2023 to 76,023,349 IDR, reflecting asset growth of approximately 13.7%. Total liabilities rose moderately by about 12% from 25,626,062 IDR to 28,704,021 IDR, while shareholders' equity increased by 14.8% from 41,201,586 IDR to 47,319,328 IDR, indicating strengthened net worth. The current ratio decreased from 246.89% to 215.55%, suggesting a slight reduction in short-term liquidity but still maintaining a comfortable liquidity buffer above 2.0. The debt to equity ratio improved marginally from 62.20% to 60.66%, indicating a stable and slightly more conservative capital structure with manageable leverage. Overall, the company’s balance sheet reflects growth in asset base and equity with controlled liabilities, supporting a robust financial position in 2024. | In 2023, PT BUMI SERPONG DAMAI TBK demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing slightly from 64,999,403 to 66,827,649 IDR. The company’s total liabilities decreased from 26,953,967 to 25,626,062 IDR, indicating improved liability management. Shareholders' equity rose from 38,045,436 to 41,201,586 IDR, reflecting strengthened net worth. The current ratio slightly declined from 261.07% in 2022 to 246.89% in 2023, but remains well above 100%, indicating strong liquidity to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio improved from 70.85% to 62.20%, suggesting a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained a healthy balance sheet with increased equity, controlled liabilities, and strong liquidity in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company exhibited strong profitability improvements in 2024. Revenue increased significantly by 19.5% from 11,539,141,250,155 IDR in 2023 to 13,796,572,148,837 IDR. Cost of goods sold decreased slightly by 2.8%, enhancing gross profit by 37.5% to 8,816,385,465,162 IDR. Gross margin improved markedly from 55.56% to 63.90%, reflecting better cost control or pricing power. Operating income rose by 53.5% to 4,468,905,803,578 IDR, with operating margin expanding from 25.22% to 32.39%. Net profit more than doubled, increasing by 117.6% to 4,917,670,536,213 IDR, and net profit margin surged from 19.58% to 35.64%, indicating high earnings quality and operational leverage. Return on equity and return on assets also improved substantially, with ROE increasing from 5,702,313.55% to 11,110,754.09% and ROA from 3,427,910.74% to 6,885,034.90%, underscoring efficient use of equity and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate rose slightly from 0.45% to 0.56%, but remained low, supporting net profitability. | Revenue surged dramatically from approximately 10.24 trillion IDR in 2022 to over 11.54 trillion IDR in 2023, indicating significant top-line growth. However, gross profit decreased in margin terms from 66.69% to 55.56%, reflecting higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income margin also declined from 36.20% to 25.22%, and net profit margin dropped from 25.96% to 19.58%, signaling margin compression despite revenue growth. Net profit in absolute terms was 2.26 trillion IDR in 2023, down from 2.66 trillion IDR in 2022, showing earnings pressure. The effective tax rate increased slightly from 0.18% to 0.45%. Return on equity and return on assets are extraordinarily high at 5,702,313.55% and 3,427,910.74% respectively, which may indicate data anomalies or extraordinary accounting effects but suggest very high earnings relative to equity and assets. Overall, profitability grew in revenue but margins and net profit declined, indicating earnings quality challenges. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by increased asset turnover from 17,506,484.56% to 19,316,031.87%, indicating more effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Despite a rise in operating expenses by 24.1% to 4,347,479,661,584 IDR, the company managed to expand operating income significantly, suggesting effective cost management relative to revenue growth. Inventories increased by 17.8% to 16,860,604 IDR, which may reflect higher sales demand or stockpiling for future sales. Net cash from operations grew by 8.9% to 916,030,528,262 IDR, supporting operational cash flow strength. However, net cash from investing activities showed a large outflow of (2,715,094,311,001) IDR compared to (315,001,477,009) IDR in 2023, indicating substantial investment spending. Working capital remains positive given current assets of 30,896,492 IDR against current liabilities of 14,333,487 IDR, supporting operational liquidity. | Cost control appears challenged as cost of goods sold rose substantially to 5.13 trillion IDR, reducing gross margin. Operating expenses increased to 3.50 trillion IDR, further pressuring operating income. Asset utilization, as measured by asset turnover, is extremely high at 17,506,484.56, which may reflect data scale issues but suggests very efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations was strong at 840.49 billion IDR, indicating good cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased from 12.61 million to 14.31 million IDR, which may require monitoring for inventory management. Overall, while cash flow from operations is robust, rising costs and inventory levels suggest areas for operational efficiency improvement. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators suggest a stable risk profile with some positive trends. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 60.66%, indicating moderate leverage. Interest expense decreased by 12.7% to 1,412,252,663,821 IDR, while interest coverage ratio improved significantly from 179.78% to 316.44%, reflecting enhanced ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The current ratio, while lower than 2023, remains strong at 215.55%, indicating good short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate increased marginally but remains low at 0.56%, minimizing tax-related risks. The large increase in investing cash outflows may pose liquidity risk if not matched by financing or operational cash inflows. The net increase in cash was negative (566,181,225,340) IDR in 2024, contrasting with a positive increase in 2023, which warrants monitoring. Overall, the company maintains manageable leverage and strong interest coverage but should watch cash flow volatility due to heavy investing activity. | Leverage risk decreased as debt to equity ratio improved to 62.20% from 70.85%, reducing financial risk. Interest expense remained very high at 1.62 trillion IDR, with interest coverage ratio declining from 222.12% to 179.78%, indicating reduced but still adequate ability to cover interest payments. Current liabilities slightly increased, but current ratio remains strong at 246.89%, indicating low liquidity risk. The effective tax rate increased marginally, but remains low at 0.45%, minimizing tax burden risk. No significant early warning signs from working capital or cash flow data, though high interest expense warrants monitoring. Overall, financial risk is moderate with improved leverage and strong liquidity but high interest costs. |
| Future financial performance projection | The substantial net cash outflow from investing activities (2,715,094,311,001 IDR) in 2024 suggests aggressive investment in growth or expansion, which may support future revenue and profit growth. This is complemented by a positive net cash inflow from financing activities of 1,232,882,557,399 IDR, indicating external funding support for investments. Dividend payments increased nearly threefold to 175,680,000,000 IDR, signaling confidence in cash flow sustainability and a shareholder-friendly policy. Revenue growth was broad-based across segments, with real estate revenue increasing from 10,558,176,069,385 IDR to 12,365,047,454,098 IDR and new contributions from the hotel segment (17,790,521,887 IDR) and increased toll road revenue, suggesting diversification and geographic market stability. Given these factors, the company appears well-positioned for continued financial performance improvement, supported by strategic investments and strong operational cash flow, though monitoring cash flow balance will be critical. | Investment activity in 2023 shows net cash used in investing of (315.00) billion IDR, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions. Financing cash flow was negative (312.90) billion IDR, possibly reflecting debt repayments or dividend payments, with dividends declared at 58.00 billion IDR, signaling a shareholder return policy. Net increase in cash was positive at 212.59 billion IDR, supporting cash flow sustainability. Revenue concentration remains in real estate and property segments, with geographic diversification across major Indonesian cities including Jabodetabek, Semarang, Surabaya, and others, suggesting growth opportunities in multiple regions. The absence of hotel revenue in 2023 may indicate strategic shifts. Overall, the company appears to be investing for growth while maintaining cash flow and returning value to shareholders, supporting a positive outlook for future financial performance. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces significant economic challenges in 2024 and beyond, primarily driven by the combination of inflation and rising interest rates. Bank Indonesia increased the benchmark interest rate to 6.25% in April 2024, directly increasing borrowing costs including mortgages (KPR) and apartment ownership loans (KPA), which potentially suppresses consumer purchasing power. Inflation has also driven up prices of building materials and project operational costs, creating a difficult environment for developers to balance profitability and consumer attraction. Declining demand for mortgages due to higher borrowing costs further pressures the property sector. Additionally, global economic uncertainties such as geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Russia-Ukraine, Middle East tensions), potential trade wars, and supply chain disruptions have led to increased energy and food prices, raising living costs and potentially reducing purchasing power and economic growth. At the national level, these global instabilities may trigger decreased purchasing power, increased poverty, and foreign investment outflows. The property market also faces classic challenges like limited land availability in urban areas, prompting the need for vertical developments or alternative land use. The Company anticipates continued challenges in 2025 including rising building material prices, intensified competition, and ongoing national and global economic uncertainties. Despite Indonesia's resilient economic growth (5.03% in 2024, projected 4.8-5.6% in 2025), the Company remains cautious of global economic slowdown, political uncertainties, and inflationary pressures that could impact export performance and domestic market conditions. | The Company faces several economic challenges in 2023, including the increase in Bank Indonesia (BI) interest rates, which rose twice by 25 basis points each to reach 6% in October 2023. This increase impacts property demand as most purchases use mortgage loans (KPR or KPA), making installments more expensive and potentially reducing demand. Additionally, global economic conditions pose risks such as slowing global growth projected at 3.0% in 2023, driven by geopolitical conflicts disrupting supply chains, rising energy and food prices, tightening monetary policies in developed countries, and the El Nino phenomenon affecting food production. These factors contribute to high inflationary pressures. Nationally, these global issues have led to decreased purchasing power, increased poverty, and heightened economic crisis risks. The Company responds with cautious expansion and strong risk management to maintain resilience. Furthermore, the 2024 political year with presidential elections is expected to cause economic and property market fluctuations. High lending rates, bureaucratic issues, and delayed tax incentives also challenge property sales recovery. Interest rate risk is significant due to the Company's exposure to bank loans, with a 1% increase in interest rates potentially reducing net profit by approximately IDR94 billion. Inflation, cost pressures, and market uncertainties remain key economic challenges affecting revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Company encounters intensified competitive pressures characterized by increasing numbers of new developers and property projects, leading to fiercer competition for market share. Developers are compelled to continuously innovate and offer attractive products with added value to maintain competitiveness. The property market slowdown, especially in residential segments, is exacerbated by higher interest rates and economic uncertainties, making consumers more cautious in large expenditures like property purchases. The Company also faces competition from both established industry players and new entrants, requiring strategic marketing, product innovation, and diversification. Technological disruption is addressed through digital marketing initiatives and leveraging digital economy growth opportunities, such as the Digital Hub Special Economic Zone in BSD City. The Company actively collaborates with strategic partners and invests in innovative commercial and residential projects to sustain its market leadership. Despite a positive business outlook, the Directors recognize the need to mitigate competitive risks through product diversification, operational efficiency, and strategic partnerships to maintain and strengthen its market position amid evolving industry dynamics. | The report does not explicitly address competitive pressures or market competition challenges faced by the Company in 2023.
