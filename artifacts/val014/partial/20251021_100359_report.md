# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue increased from IDR 10,235,479,955,727 to IDR 13,796,572,148,837, representing a compound growth of approximately 34.8% over two years. The year-over-year revenue growth was about 12.7% from 2022 to 2023 and a stronger 19.5% from 2023 to 2024. Gross profit showed volatility, decreasing from IDR 6,826,040,000,000 in 2022 to IDR 6,411,686,000,000 in 2023, then sharply increasing to IDR 8,820,000,000,000 in 2024. Correspondingly, gross margin declined from 66.69% in 2022 to 55.56% in 2023, then rebounded to 63.90% in 2024, indicating improved cost control or pricing power in 2024 after a dip in 2023. Revenue by product/service in 2024 was dominated by Land and buildings at IDR 10,589,095,732,806, up from IDR 8,759,876,367,613 in 2023, showing strong growth in this segment. Land and strata title revenue slightly decreased from IDR 1,066,036,484,848 in 2023 to IDR 995,487,894,333 in 2024. Other notable increases include Rental (IDR 967,578,459,570 in 2024 vs. IDR 917,685,968,589 in 2023) and Construction (IDR 614,844,437,603 in 2024 vs. IDR 273,693,013,225 in 2023), indicating expansion in construction activities. Several smaller segments such as Service charge, Utilities, Parking, and Promotion also showed moderate growth. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional analysis. Overall, the company experienced solid revenue growth with a recovery in gross margin in 2024, driven primarily by the Land and buildings segment and increased construction revenue. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income fluctuated from IDR 3,705,010,000,000 in 2022 down to IDR 2,910,167,000,000 in 2023, then rose significantly to IDR 4,470,000,000,000 in 2024. Operating margin followed a similar pattern, decreasing from 36.20% in 2022 to 25.22% in 2023 before improving to 32.40% in 2024. This indicates a dip in operating efficiency in 2023, possibly due to higher operating expenses or lower revenue quality, followed by a recovery in 2024. Operating expenses increased steadily from IDR 3,121,030,000,000 in 2022 to IDR 3,501,519,000,000 in 2023 and further to IDR 3,946,855,862,927 in 2024, but the growth in operating income outpaced expense increases in 2024, reflecting improved cost management and operational leverage. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved in 2024 compared to 2023, signaling better profitability from core operations. Overall, the company demonstrated enhanced operating efficiency in 2024 after a challenging 2023, with effective cost control and revenue growth contributing to stronger operating margins. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased gradually from 0.18% in 2022 to 0.45% in 2023 and further to 0.56% in 2024, remaining very low overall. This minimal tax burden positively impacted net profitability, as reflected in the net profit margin rising from 25.96% in 2022 to 35.66% in 2024, despite fluctuations in operating margin. Income tax expense increased in absolute terms but remained a small fraction of pre-tax income, suggesting possible tax incentives or efficient tax planning. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the provided financials. External factors affecting profitability cannot be directly assessed due to lack of geographic revenue data and external environment information. However, the low tax rate and steady net profit growth imply favorable external conditions or effective management of external financial impacts. |

Overall, the balance sheet indicates a stable and improving financial health with prudent capital and liability management in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company exhibited significant profitability improvements in 2024. Revenue increased by approximately 19.5% from IDR 11.54 trillion in 2023 to IDR 13.80 trillion. Despite a slight decrease in cost of goods sold from IDR 5.13 trillion to IDR 4.98 trillion, gross profit surged by 37.6% to IDR 8.82 trillion, driving the gross margin up from 55.56% to 63.90%. Operating expenses increased moderately by 12.7%, but operating income rose sharply by 53.6% to IDR 4.47 trillion, improving the operating margin from 25.22% to 32.40%. Net profit more than doubled from IDR 2.26 trillion to IDR 4.92 trillion, lifting the net profit margin from 19.58% to 35.66%. Return on equity nearly doubled from 5.70% to 11.12%, and return on assets improved from 3.43% to 6.89%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate remained low but increased slightly from 0.45% to 0.56%, having minimal impact on net profitability. Overall, 2024 reflects strong revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved returns, signaling sustainable earnings quality. | Revenue increased by approximately 12.7% from IDR 10,235,479,955,727 in 2022 to IDR 11,539,141,250,155 in 2023, showing top-line growth. However, gross profit declined from IDR 6,826,040,000,000 to IDR 6,411,686,000,000, resulting in a significant drop in gross margin from 66.69% to 55.56%, indicating increased cost of goods sold pressure (COGS rose from IDR 3,409,439,613,895 to IDR 5,127,454,604,612). Operating income decreased from IDR 3,705,010,000,000 to IDR 2,910,167,000,000, with operating margin falling from 36.20% to 25.22%, reflecting higher operating expenses (up from IDR 3,121,030,000,000 to IDR 3,501,519,000,000). Net profit declined from IDR 2,656,886,000,000 to IDR 2,259,457,000,000, with net profit margin dropping from 25.96% to 19.58%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 5.70% and 3.43%, respectively, indicating moderate earnings quality and sustainability. The effective tax rate increased from 0.18% to 0.45%, and interest expense appeared in 2023 at IDR 1,620,000,000,000, impacting net profitability. Overall, while revenue grew, profitability margins and earnings quality weakened in 2023 due to rising costs and expenses. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by margin expansion and asset utilization. The operating margin increased from 25.22% to 32.40%, indicating better cost control relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover rose from 17.51% to 19.32%, showing more effective use of assets to generate sales. Inventories increased from IDR 14.31 trillion to IDR 16.86 trillion, which may reflect higher sales demand or stockpiling for future operations. Net cash from operations grew modestly from IDR 840.5 billion to IDR 916.0 billion, supporting operational cash flow stability. Working capital, inferred from current assets and liabilities, remained strong though the current ratio declined slightly, suggesting some tightening in short-term liquidity management. Overall, the company enhanced operational efficiency through improved margins and asset utilization while maintaining positive operating cash flow. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed challenges as operating margin declined to 25.22% from 36.20% in 2022, indicating increased cost pressures and less effective cost control. The asset turnover ratio was strong at 17.51, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Cash flow from operations was positive at IDR 840,493,807,756, indicating operational cash generation, though no prior year data is available for comparison. Working capital management appears stable with current assets slightly decreasing and current liabilities slightly increasing, resulting in a current ratio of 246.81%. Inventories increased from IDR 12,609,570,000,000 to IDR 14,310,000,000,000, which may indicate higher stock levels potentially impacting working capital efficiency. Overall, while asset utilization remains high, cost control and operating efficiency have deteriorated somewhat in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a generally favorable risk profile. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved from 62.21% to 60.65%, indicating stable leverage levels. Interest expense decreased from IDR 1.62 trillion to IDR 1.41 trillion, reducing financing costs. Interest coverage ratio improved substantially from 179.64% to 317.02%, reflecting a much stronger ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate increased marginally but remains very low, minimizing tax-related risks. Current liabilities increased more than current assets, causing the current ratio to decline from 246.81% to 215.63%, which may warrant monitoring for liquidity risk, though the ratio remains healthy. No dividend data is available, so payout-related risks cannot be assessed. Overall, the company’s leverage and liquidity indicators suggest low financial risk with strong interest coverage and manageable debt levels. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a moderate risk profile. The debt to equity ratio improved to 62.21% from 70.85% in 2022, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk.

Liquidity remains robust with a current ratio of 246.81%, though slightly lower than the previous year. The effective tax rate increased to 0.45% from 0.18%, which may slightly impact net income but does not pose a significant risk.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The company faces significant economic challenges in 2024 and beyond, primarily driven by inflation and rising interest rates. Bank Indonesia increased the benchmark interest rate to 6.25% in April 2024, directly increasing borrowing costs, including mortgages (KPR) and apartment ownership loans (KPA), which dampens consumer purchasing power and demand. Inflation has also pushed up prices of building materials and operational costs, creating a difficult environment for developers to balance profitability and consumer attraction. Additionally, global economic uncertainties such as geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Russia-Ukraine, Middle East tensions), potential trade wars, and supply chain disruptions have led to increased energy and food prices, raising living costs and potentially slowing economic growth. These global factors may reduce domestic purchasing power, increase poverty, and cause foreign investment outflows. Nationally, challenges include limited land availability, especially in urban areas, and slowing growth in the residential property market, with a noted contraction in sales and price growth. The company also anticipates rising building material costs and economic uncertainties continuing into 2025. Despite Indonesia's resilient economic growth of 5.03% in 2024 and optimistic projections for 2025, the company remains cautious of global economic slowdowns, protectionist policies, and inflationary pressures that could impact export performance and domestic market conditions. | The Company faces several economic challenges in 2023, including the increase in Bank Indonesia (BI) interest rates, which rose twice by 25 basis points each to reach 6% in October 2023. This increase impacts property demand as most purchases use mortgage payment methods (KPR or KPA), making property installments more expensive and potentially reducing demand. Additionally, global economic conditions pose risks, with a slowing global growth rate expected at 3.0% in 2023 due to geopolitical conflicts disrupting supply chains, rising energy and food prices, tightening monetary policies in developed countries, and the El Nino phenomenon affecting food production. These factors contribute to high inflationary pressures. Nationally, these global issues have led to decreased purchasing power, increased poverty, and heightened economic crisis risks. The Company responds by implementing strong risk management and cautious expansion strategies. Furthermore, the 2024 political year with presidential elections is expected to cause economic and property market fluctuations. Other economic uncertainties include licensing and bureaucratic challenges, high lending rates, and delayed tax incentives affecting property sales decisions. Interest rate risk is significant due to the Company's exposure to bank loans, with a 1% increase in interest rates potentially reducing net profit by approximately IDR94 billion in 2023. Foreign exchange risk exists but is limited as most transactions are in Indonesian Rupiah. Inflation and cost pressures have also increased operating expenses and cost of goods sold, impacting profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The company faces intensified competitive pressures due to an increasing number of new property developers and new projects, leading to fierce competition for market share. Developers are required to continuously innovate and offer attractive products with added value to maintain competitiveness. The company acknowledges the need to strengthen marketing and sales strategies, explore new business opportunities, and increase product innovation to sustain its market position. Competition is also driven by shifting consumer preferences towards sustainable, healthy, and environmentally friendly lifestyles, requiring the company to develop integrated sustainable estates and innovative products. The company is expanding its portfolio, including commercial properties and joint ventures, to diversify and strengthen its market presence. Additionally, the company leverages digital technology and strategic collaborations, such as the Digital Hub Special Economic Zone, to enhance competitiveness. Despite a positive business outlook, the company recognizes that rising building material prices, intensifying competition, and economic uncertainties pose ongoing challenges to maintaining its leadership in the Indonesian property industry. | The 2023 annual report does not explicitly discuss competitive pressures or market competition faced by the Company. There is no direct mention of threats from established industry players, new disruptive entrants, technological disruptions, or industry dynamics challenging the Company's market position.
