# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue increased from IDR 10,235,479,955,727 to IDR 13,796,572,148,837, representing a compound growth of approximately 13.2% from 2022 to 2023 and 19.5% from 2023 to 2024. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) rose from IDR 3,409,439,613,895 in 2022 to IDR 4,980,186,683,675 in 2024, showing a 50.1% increase over the period, with a notable decrease from 2023 to 2024. Gross profit fluctuated, decreasing from IDR 6,826,040,341,832 in 2022 to IDR 6,411,686,645,543 in 2023 (-6.1%), then sharply increasing to IDR 8,816,385,465,162 in 2024 (+37.5%). Correspondingly, gross margin declined from 66.69% in 2022 to 55.56% in 2023, then rebounded to 63.90% in 2024, indicating improved cost control or pricing power in 2024 after a dip in 2023. Revenue by product/service shows that 'Tanah dan bangunan' (land and buildings) is the dominant revenue source, growing from IDR 7,292,314,919,581 in 2022 to IDR 10,589,095,732,806 in 2024, a 45.2% increase over two years. 'Tanah dan bangunan strata title' revenue increased from IDR 611,532,591,919 in 2022 to IDR 995,487,894,333 in 2024 (+62.8%). 'Sewa' (rent) revenue remained relatively stable, slightly increasing from IDR 925,484,000,326 in 2022 to IDR 967,578,459,570 in 2024 (+4.5%). 'Konstruksi' (construction) revenue decreased significantly from IDR 980,496,535,198 in 2022 to IDR 614,844,437,603 in 2024 (-37.3%), indicating a possible strategic shift or project completion. Other smaller revenue streams such as 'Jasa pelayanan', 'Prasarana', and 'Parkir' showed moderate growth. Geographic revenue data is not available, limiting regional analysis. Overall, the company shows strong revenue growth driven primarily by land and building sales, with improved gross margin in 2024 after a dip in 2023, reflecting better direct cost management or pricing strategies. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from IDR 3,705,009,673,794 in 2022 to IDR 4,468,905,803,578 in 2024, a 20.6% increase over two years, with a dip in 2023 to IDR 2,910,167,966,982 (-21.4% from 2022) before recovering strongly in 2024 (+53.5% from 2023). Operating margin followed a similar pattern, declining from 36.20% in 2022 to 25.22% in 2023, then rising to 32.39% in 2024. Operating expenses increased steadily from IDR 3,121,030,668,038 in 2022 to IDR 4,347,479,661,584 in 2024 (+39.3%), with a sharper increase from 2023 to 2024 (+24.2%). Despite rising operating expenses, the operating margin recovery in 2024 suggests improved operational leverage due to higher revenue growth outpacing expense increases. The relationship between operating income and revenue indicates that the company managed to improve profitability after a challenging 2023, likely through cost control or efficiency gains. However, the increase in operating expenses warrants monitoring to ensure sustainable margin improvement. Overall, operating efficiency shows a U-shaped trend with a dip in 2023 and recovery in 2024, reflecting management's ability to adapt and improve operational performance. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 0.18% in 2022 to 0.56% in 2024, remaining very low overall, which positively impacts net profitability. Income tax expense rose from IDR 4,806,064,184 in 2022 to IDR 27,731,890,354 in 2024, consistent with higher taxable income but still representing a minimal tax burden. Net profit increased significantly from IDR 2,656,885,590,302 in 2022 to IDR 4,917,670,536,213 in 2024 (+85.1%), with net profit margin improving from 25.96% in 2022 to 35.64% in 2024, indicating strong bottom-line growth. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns, and no geographic revenue data to assess external regional impacts. The low tax rate and steady net profit growth suggest favorable external tax conditions or tax planning strategies. No other external factors are evident from the data provided. Overall, external and one-off impacts appear minimal, with tax expense remaining a small fraction of income, supporting strong net profitability. |

Overall, the company’s balance sheet reflects healthy growth in assets and equity with manageable increases in liabilities, supporting a solid financial health status in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a moderate increase in total assets to 66,827,648 Rupiah from 64,999,403 Rupiah in 2022, indicating asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from 35,412,727 Rupiah to 37,452,830 Rupiah.

The debt to equity ratio improved from 70.85% to 62.20%, signaling a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a solid financial position with asset growth, reduced leverage, and increased equity supporting financial stability in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company’s profitability improved significantly in 2024. Revenue increased by approximately 19.5%, from 11,539,141,250,155 Rupiah in 2023 to 13,796,572,148,837 Rupiah in 2024. Despite a slight decrease in cost of goods sold from 5,127,454,604,612 Rupiah to 4,980,186,683,675 Rupiah, gross profit surged by 37.5% to 8,816,385,465,162 Rupiah. This improvement is reflected in the gross margin rising from 55.56% to 63.90%. Operating expenses increased by 24.1%, but operating income still grew by 53.5% to 4,468,905,803,578 Rupiah, lifting the operating margin from 25.22% to 32.39%. Net profit more than doubled from 2,259,456,837,723 Rupiah to 4,917,670,536,213 Rupiah, with net profit margin expanding from 19.58% to 35.64%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and operational leverage. Return on equity and return on assets also improved markedly, with ROE rising from 5,702,313.55% to 11,110,754.09% and ROA from 3,427,910.77% to 6,885,034.95%, underscoring strong profitability and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased slightly from 0.45% to 0.56%, but remains low, supporting net earnings sustainability. Overall, 2024 shows robust profitability growth and high-quality earnings. | Revenue increased by approximately 12.7% from 10,235,479,955,727 Rupiah in 2022 to 11,539,141,250,155 Rupiah in 2023, demonstrating top-line growth. However, gross profit declined from 6,826,040,341,832 Rupiah to 6,411,686,645,543 Rupiah, resulting in a significant drop in gross margin from 66.69% to 55.56%, primarily due to a sharp increase in cost of goods sold from 3,409,439,613,895 Rupiah to 5,127,454,604,612 Rupiah. Operating income decreased from 3,705,009,673,794 Rupiah to 2,910,167,966,982 Rupiah, with operating margin contracting from 36.20% to 25.22%, reflecting higher operating expenses rising from 3,121,030,668,038 Rupiah to 3,501,518,678,561 Rupiah. Net profit fell from 2,656,885,590,302 Rupiah to 2,259,456,837,723 Rupiah, and net profit margin declined from 25.96% to 19.58%. Return on equity and return on assets are reported at extremely high values (5,702,313.55% and 3,427,910.77% respectively), which may indicate data anomalies or extraordinary earnings relative to equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased slightly from 0.18% to 0.45%, but remains very low, supporting earnings sustainability. Overall, while revenue grew, profitability margins and net earnings quality weakened in 2023 due to rising costs and expenses. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by margin expansion and asset utilization. The operating margin increased from 25.22% to 32.39%, reflecting better cost control despite higher operating expenses. Asset turnover rose from 17,506,484.69% to 19,316,032.00%, indicating more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased from 840,493,807,756 Rupiah to 916,030,528,262 Rupiah, supporting strong cash generation capacity. Inventories increased from 14,307,594 Rupiah to 16,860,604 Rupiah, which may reflect higher sales volume or stockpiling for future demand. The current ratio decreased but remains healthy at 215.55%, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, the company enhanced its operational efficiency through improved margins, better asset utilization, and strong operating cash flow in 2024. | The operating margin decreased notably to 25.22% in 2023 from 36.20% in 2022, indicating reduced cost control efficiency. Cost of goods sold increased disproportionately relative to revenue, negatively impacting gross margin and operating income. Asset turnover is reported at an extremely high 17,506,484.69, which may reflect data scale or classification issues but suggests very high revenue generation relative to asset base. Net cash from operations in 2023 was positive at 840,493,807,756 Rupiah, indicating strong cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased from 12,609,570 Rupiah to 14,307,594 Rupiah, which may imply higher stock levels potentially affecting working capital. Current liabilities increased slightly while current assets decreased marginally, causing a slight dip in the current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency shows challenges in cost control and margin compression, but strong cash flow from operations supports operational liquidity and working capital management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a stable and improving risk profile. The debt to equity ratio slightly decreased from 62.20% to 60.66%, indicating a modest reduction in leverage. Interest expense declined from 1,618,745,644,976 Rupiah to 1,412,252,663,821 Rupiah, reducing financing costs. Interest coverage ratio improved significantly from 179.78% to 316.44%, demonstrating a much stronger ability to cover interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate increased marginally but remains low at 0.56%, posing minimal tax risk. Current liabilities increased, but the current ratio remains robust, mitigating short-term liquidity risk. No data on retained earnings or dividends limits assessment of payout risk. Overall, the company’s leverage and liquidity metrics suggest low financial risk and strong capacity to meet obligations in 2024. | Leverage decreased in 2023 as evidenced by a lower debt to equity ratio of 62.20% compared to 70.85% in 2022, reducing financial risk. Interest expense slightly decreased from 1,667,991,852,534 Rupiah to 1,618,745,644,976 Rupiah, while interest coverage ratio declined from 222.12% to 179.78%, indicating a reduced but still comfortable ability to cover interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate increased marginally but remains very low at 0.45%, minimizing tax-related risks. Current ratio remains strong at 246.89%, suggesting good short-term liquidity. However, the decline in profitability margins and operating income could pressure future interest coverage if trends continue. No data on dividends or contingent liabilities is available. Overall, financial risk is moderate with improved leverage and liquidity, but vigilance is warranted due to margin compression and slightly reduced interest coverage. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a substantial increase in cash outflows from investing activities, with net cash from investing moving from an outflow of 315,001,477,009 Rupiah in 2023 to a much larger outflow of 2,715,094,311,001 Rupiah in 2024, indicating aggressive capital expenditure or acquisitions to support future growth.

Despite strong operating cash flow, the company experienced a net decrease in cash of 566,181,225,340 Rupiah in 2024, reflecting heavy investment and financing cash flow dynamics. Revenue growth across multiple product lines, especially in construction and land/building segments, supports positive growth prospects. Absence of dividend data precludes dividend policy analysis. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued expansion supported by significant investment and financing activities, with operational cash flow providing a foundation for sustainable future performance. | Investment activities in 2023 show net cash outflow from investing of (315,001,477,009) Rupiah, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting future growth. Net cash from financing activities was also negative at (312,903,780,210) Rupiah, suggesting debt repayments or reduced external financing. The net increase in cash of 212,588,550,537 Rupiah reflects positive cash flow management. Revenue growth was driven by significant increases in key segments such as 'Tanah dan bangunan' (from 7,292,314,919,581 Rupiah to 8,759,876,367,613 Rupiah) and 'Tanah dan bangunan strata title' (from 611,532,591,919 Rupiah to 1,066,036,484,848 Rupiah), indicating strong market demand in these areas. Some segments like 'Konstruksi' saw a sharp revenue decline, which may require strategic review. No dividend data is available, so dividend policy impact cannot be assessed. Overall, the company is investing in growth while maintaining positive operational cash flow, positioning it for continued expansion, though segment performance variability and margin pressures should be monitored. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The company faces significant economic challenges in 2024 and anticipates them continuing into 2025. Key economic challenges include inflation and rising interest rates, with Bank Indonesia increasing the benchmark interest rate to 6.25% in April 2024 before lowering it back to 6% in September 2024. These changes increase borrowing costs, particularly for mortgages (KPR) and apartment ownership loans (KPA), which dampen consumer purchasing power and reduce demand. Inflation also drives up prices of building materials and operational costs, pressuring developers to balance profitability with consumer appeal. Additionally, global economic uncertainties such as geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Russia-Ukraine, Middle East tensions), potential trade wars, and supply chain disruptions have led to increased energy and food prices, raising living costs and potentially slowing economic growth. These global factors may reduce domestic purchasing power, increase poverty, and cause foreign investment outflows. Nationally, challenges include limited land availability in urban areas, which forces developers to seek alternatives like vertical projects. The property market shows signs of slowing, with residential property price growth decelerating and sales contracting, partly due to higher mortgage burdens and economic caution among consumers. The company also notes risks from fluctuating foreign exchange rates and interest rate sensitivity impacting financial results. Despite these challenges, the company remains optimistic due to strong domestic economic growth, government infrastructure projects improving connectivity, and sustained consumer interest in property ownership. The company has implemented marketing innovations and strategic land acquisitions to mitigate these economic pressures and sustain growth. | The Company faces several economic challenges in 2023, including the increase in Bank Indonesia (BI) interest rates, which rose twice by 25 basis points to 6% in October 2023. This increase impacts property demand as most purchases use mortgage payment methods (KPR or KPA), making property installments more expensive and potentially reducing demand. Additionally, global economic conditions pose risks, with a slowing global growth rate expected at 3.0% in 2023 due to geopolitical conflicts disrupting supply chains, rising energy and food prices, tightening monetary policies in developed countries, and the El Nino phenomenon affecting food production. These factors contribute to high inflationary pressures. Nationally, these global issues have led to decreased purchasing power, increased poverty, and heightened economic crisis risks. The Company responds by implementing strong risk management and cautious expansion strategies. Furthermore, the 2024 political year with presidential elections is expected to cause economic and property market fluctuations. Other economic uncertainties include high lending rates, bureaucratic licensing issues, and delayed tax incentives affecting property sales decisions. Interest rate risk is significant due to the Company's exposure to bank loans, with a 1% increase in Rupiah-denominated loan interest rates potentially reducing net profit by approximately IDR94 billion. Inflation and cost pressures have also increased operating expenses and cost of goods sold, impacting profitability. The Company remains vigilant about these macroeconomic factors and cost pressures that could affect revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The company faces intensified competitive pressures in the Indonesian property industry, driven by an increasing number of new developers and new property projects, which heighten competition for market share. Developers are compelled to continuously innovate and offer attractive products with added value to maintain competitiveness. The company acknowledges the need to adapt to evolving consumer preferences, including a shift towards sustainable and environmentally friendly residential products and integrated living areas. Technological disruption and digital economic growth opportunities are also recognized, with the company leveraging digital marketing and developing a Digital Hub Special Economic Zone to strengthen its market position. Competition extends across residential, commercial, and retail segments, with the company expanding its portfolio through acquisitions and strategic partnerships to enhance its offerings and market reach. The company also faces competition in commercial products targeting millennials and in retail and hospitality sectors, where it develops unique concepts and collaborates with strategic partners. Despite the competitive landscape, the company maintains leadership by focusing on innovation, product diversification, strategic collaborations, and operational efficiency to sustain its market position. | The 2023 annual report does not explicitly discuss competitive pressures or market competition faced by the Company. There is no direct mention of threats from established industry players, new disruptive entrants, technological disruptions, or industry dynamics challenging the Company's market position. Therefore, information on competitive pressures is not addressed in the provided text. |
