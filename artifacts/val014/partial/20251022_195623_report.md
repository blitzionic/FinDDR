# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT BUMI SERPONG DAMAI Tbk's revenue showed a strong upward trend from IDR 10,235.480 billion in 2022 to IDR 11,539.141 billion in 2023, and further to IDR 13,796.572 billion in 2024, representing a compound growth. However, the gross margin declined from 66.69% in 2022 to 55.56% in 2023 before recovering to 63.90% in 2024, indicating some volatility in cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service highlights that land and buildings dominate sales, increasing from approximately IDR 7,292.315 billion in 2022 to IDR 10,589.096 billion in 2024, showing strong core asset sales growth. Other segments like rental and construction also grew, with construction revenue more than doubling from IDR 273.693 billion in 2023 to IDR 614.844 billion in 2024. Geographically, BSD City consistently contributed a majority share, 53% in 2024 and 57% in 2023, with other regions like Grand Wisata Bekasi and Kota Wisata Cibubur making up the remainder, indicating a strong regional concentration in revenue sources. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin experienced a decline from 36.20% in 2022 to 25.22% in 2023 but improved to 32.39% in 2024, reflecting some recovery in operational profitability. Operating income rose from IDR 3,705.010 billion in 2022 to IDR 4,468.906 billion in 2024, though the increase was not proportional to revenue growth, suggesting rising operating expenses. Operating expenses increased steadily from IDR 3,121.031 billion in 2022 to IDR 4,347.480 billion in 2024, indicating cost pressures that partially offset revenue gains. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved in 2024 compared to 2023 but remained below 2022 levels, highlighting the need for tighter cost management to sustain margin improvements. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased slightly from 0.18% in 2022 to 0.56% in 2024, but remained very low overall, minimizing tax impact on net profitability. Income tax expense rose from IDR 4.806 billion in 2022 to IDR 27.732 billion in 2024, consistent with higher pre-tax profits. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, suggesting that the profitability trends primarily reflect operational performance rather than one-off events or external shocks. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT BUMI SERPONG DAMAI Tbk demonstrated solid financial health with total assets increasing to IDR 76.023 billion from IDR 66.828 billion in 2023, reflecting asset growth of approximately 13.7%. This growth was driven by a rise in both current assets (IDR 30.896 billion vs. IDR 29.375 billion) and non-current assets (IDR 45.127 billion vs. IDR 37.453 billion). Total liabilities also increased but at a lower rate, from IDR 25.626 billion to IDR 28.704 billion, maintaining a manageable debt level. Shareholders' equity rose significantly to IDR 47.319 billion from IDR 41.202 billion, indicating strengthened net worth. The current ratio decreased from 246.89% to 215.55%, still indicating strong liquidity but a slight reduction in short-term asset coverage of current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio improved marginally from 62.20% to 60.66%, suggesting a stable and slightly more conservative capital structure. Overall, the company maintained a robust balance sheet with growth in equity and assets outpacing liabilities, supporting financial stability and capacity for future investments. | In 2023, PT BUMI SERPONG DAMAI Tbk demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing modestly from IDR 64,999.403 billion in 2022 to IDR 66,827.649 billion. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in non-current assets from IDR 35,412.727 billion to IDR 37,452.830 billion, while current assets slightly decreased to IDR 29,374.819 billion from IDR 29,586.676 billion. Total liabilities decreased from IDR 26,953.967 billion to IDR 25,626.062 billion, reflecting a reduction in both current liabilities (from IDR 11,332.854 billion to IDR 11,897.714 billion, a slight increase) and non-current liabilities (from IDR 15,621.113 billion to IDR 13,728.348 billion). Shareholders' equity improved significantly by 8.3% to IDR 41,201.586 billion, indicating strengthened net worth. The current ratio remained strong at 246.89%, though slightly lower than 261.07% in 2022, indicating ample liquidity to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio improved to 62.20% from 70.85%, suggesting a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained a healthy balance sheet with increased equity, controlled liabilities, and strong liquidity in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company exhibited strong profitability improvements in 2024. Revenue increased by nearly 20% to IDR 13,796.57 billion from IDR 11,539.14 billion in 2023, driven by growth in key segments such as land and buildings and construction. Gross profit rose substantially to IDR 8,816.39 billion from IDR 6,411.69 billion, improving the gross margin from 55.56% to 63.90%, indicating better cost management or pricing power. Operating income increased to IDR 4,468.91 billion from IDR 2,910.17 billion, with operating margin expanding from 25.22% to 32.39%. Net profit more than doubled to IDR 4,917.67 billion from IDR 2,259.46 billion, pushing net profit margin up from 19.58% to 35.64%, reflecting strong bottom-line growth and earnings quality. Despite a slight increase in income tax expense, the effective tax rate remained low at 0.56%. Return on equity and return on assets remained low at 0.01%, suggesting that while profitability in absolute terms improved, returns relative to equity and assets are still modest. Interest expense decreased, and interest coverage ratio improved markedly to 316.44%, indicating enhanced ability to service debt from operating earnings. | Revenue increased by approximately 12.7% from IDR 10,235.480 billion in 2022 to IDR 11,539.141 billion in 2023, indicating top-line growth. However, gross profit declined by 6% to IDR 6,411.687 billion due to a significant rise in cost of goods sold from IDR 3,409.440 billion to IDR 5,127.455 billion, which compressed the gross margin from 66.69% to 55.56%. Operating income decreased by 21.4% to IDR 2,910.168 billion, with operating expenses rising from IDR 3,121.031 billion to IDR 3,501.519 billion, resulting in a lower operating margin of 25.22% compared to 36.20% in 2022. Net profit declined by 14.9% to IDR 2,259.457 billion, with net profit margin falling from 25.96% to 19.58%. The effective tax rate increased from 0.18% to 0.45%, and interest expense appeared in 2023 at IDR 1,618.746 billion, impacting profitability. Return on equity and return on assets were minimal at 0.01% and 0.00% respectively, indicating very low earnings relative to equity and assets. Overall, while revenue grew, profitability margins and returns weakened in 2023, reflecting margin pressure and increased financing costs. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed signals in 2024. Cost of goods sold decreased slightly to IDR 4,980.19 billion from IDR 5,127.45 billion despite higher revenue, contributing to improved gross margin. However, operating expenses increased to IDR 4,347.48 billion from IDR 3,501.52 billion, which partially offset operating income gains but still resulted in a higher operating margin. Asset turnover doubled from 0.02% to 0.04%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue, though the absolute turnover remains low. Net cash from operations increased modestly to IDR 916.03 billion from IDR 840.49 billion, supporting operational cash flow strength. Inventories rose to IDR 16.86 billion from IDR 14.31 billion, which may indicate increased stock levels possibly for future sales growth. Working capital remains strong given the current ratio above 2.1. Overall, the company improved revenue generation efficiency and maintained positive operating cash flow, though rising operating expenses warrant monitoring. | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2023. The company faced higher cost of goods sold and operating expenses, which eroded gross and operating margins. Asset turnover was very low at 0.02, indicating limited revenue generation relative to asset base, which may suggest underutilization of assets or capital-intensive operations. Inventories increased from IDR 12,609.570 billion to IDR 14,307.594 billion, potentially indicating slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. Net cash from operations was positive at IDR 840.49 billion, demonstrating operational cash generation capability despite lower net profits. However, net cash used in investing activities was IDR 315 billion and financing activities used IDR 312.9 billion, reflecting cash outflows for investments and debt repayments or other financing uses. The net increase in cash was IDR 212.59 billion, indicating overall positive cash flow management. Working capital remained strong given the current ratio above 2.4. In summary, the company maintained positive operational cash flow but faced challenges in cost control and asset utilization efficiency in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators suggest a stable risk profile with some areas to watch. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 60.66% from 62.20%, indicating stable leverage. Interest expense decreased to IDR 1,412.25 billion from IDR 1,618.75 billion, and interest coverage ratio improved significantly to 316.44% from 179.78%, reflecting enhanced capacity to meet interest obligations comfortably. The current ratio decreased but remains healthy at 215.55%, indicating good short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate increased marginally to 0.56% from 0.45%, a low level that reduces tax burden risk. However, the large negative net cash from investing activities (IDR -2,720 billion) compared to net cash from operations (IDR 916 billion) signals heavy investment outflows that may pressure liquidity if not managed prudently. The net decrease in cash of IDR 566.18 billion in 2024 versus an increase in 2023 suggests tighter cash availability. No dividends were declared, which may be a conservative measure to preserve cash. Overall, leverage and liquidity remain manageable, but investment cash outflows and cash position require close monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a moderate risk profile. The debt to equity ratio improved to 62.20% from 70.85%, indicating reduced leverage and potentially lower financial risk. However, the company incurred a significant interest expense of IDR 1,618.746 billion, which is a new cost compared to 2022 (N/A), suggesting increased debt servicing obligations. Despite this, the interest coverage ratio was very strong at 179.78%, indicating the company’s operating income is sufficient to cover interest expenses comfortably. The current ratio of 246.89% reflects strong liquidity, reducing short-term solvency risk. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 0.45%, which may marginally impact net income but is not a major risk factor. No data on retained earnings or dividends was available, limiting assessment of payout risk. Overall, the company’s leverage and liquidity metrics suggest manageable financial risk, but the emergence of significant interest expense warrants monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company’s future financial performance appears focused on growth and investment. Significant net cash outflows from investing activities (IDR -2,720 billion) in 2024 indicate aggressive capital expenditure or acquisitions, which may support future revenue expansion. Net cash from financing activities turned positive to IDR 1,230 billion from a negative outflow in 2023, suggesting new financing or capital injections to support investment. The revenue mix shows diversification with increased contributions from construction, rental, toll road services, recreation, hotel, and water treatment segments, indicating geographic and segment expansion beyond the core BSD City market, which decreased from 57% to 53% of marketing sales. The company did not declare dividends in 2024, possibly to conserve cash for growth initiatives. Given the strong profitability and improved operational cash flow, the company is positioned to sustain cash flow and fund investments, though the negative net cash change in 2024 highlights the need for careful liquidity management. The diversified revenue base and ongoing investments suggest positive prospects for future financial performance. | Looking ahead, PT BUMI SERPONG DAMAI Tbk’s investment activity in 2023 included net cash outflows of IDR 315 billion in investing activities, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. The net cash used in financing activities of IDR 312.9 billion suggests debt repayments or other financing adjustments, which could improve the capital structure further. The positive net increase in cash of IDR 212.59 billion supports cash flow sustainability. No dividend data was available, so dividend policy impact cannot be assessed. Revenue by geographic region shows concentration with 57% of marketing sales from BSD City, followed by 9% from Grand Wisata Bekasi and 5% from Kota Wisata Cibubur, indicating reliance on key markets but some geographic diversification. Revenue by product shows a shift with increased sales in land and strata title and a decrease in construction revenue, suggesting possible strategic focus changes. Given these factors, the company appears positioned for stable future performance with ongoing investments and manageable financing, but profitability pressures and market concentration should be monitored. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Company faces market risks including the impact of inflation and rising interest rates, which increase borrowing costs such as mortgages and potentially reduce consumer purchasing power. Declining demand for mortgage loans (KPR and KPA) due to higher borrowing costs is a significant challenge. Competition in the property industry is intensifying with more developers and new projects, requiring continuous innovation and attractive product offerings. Global economic uncertainties, including geopolitical conflicts and trade tensions, create instability affecting domestic property markets. Limited land availability, especially in urban areas, pressures developers to seek alternatives like vertical projects. The Company mitigates these risks through measured expansion, strategic land acquisitions, and targeted marketing strategies such as promotional campaigns (Dealcember and Infinite Living) that have helped exceed pre-sales targets. The Company also monitors global and domestic economic conditions and adapts its strategies accordingly. | The Company faces market risks including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, and credit risk. Interest rate risk arises from fluctuations in market interest rates affecting bank loans, with exposure managed through a mix of fixed and variable rate debts and evaluation of market trends. Foreign exchange risk is limited as most transactions are in Indonesian Rupiah, with foreign currency transactions only for special purposes and regularly reviewed. Credit risk stems from customers' failure to meet obligations, managed by placing cash and investments with reputable financial institutions, imposing fines for late payments, requiring advance rent payments and security deposits, and maintaining relationships with credible travel agents for hotel receivables. The Company also faces macroeconomic challenges such as rising BI interest rates impacting property demand due to higher mortgage costs, and global economic slowdown causing inflation and reduced purchasing power. To mitigate these, the Company implements aggressive marketing strategies, monitors market and competitor information, and exercises prudence in expansion. Additionally, ESG-related risks and climate change are integrated into existing risk categories. The Company anticipates fluctuations in property demand in 2024 due to political events and global economic factors but remains optimistic about long-term prospects driven by infrastructure development and economic growth. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include business continuity challenges, internal control effectiveness, and risks related to information technology. The Company has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework integrated into business processes, including IT Disaster Recovery Plan (ITDRP) to address IT-related risks. The Risk Management and Sustainability Unit conducts periodic reviews of internal controls, fire safety drills, IT security testing, and business impact analyses for critical units. Risk analytics and modeling are used to monitor key risk indicators. The Company also focuses on developing a strong risk culture through training and involvement of control owners and Risk Champions. Sustainable operational practices include waste management, renewable energy certificate usage, green building certifications, and social/community initiatives. These measures aim to mitigate operational disruptions and enhance resilience. | Operational risks arise from internal process weaknesses, human resources, technology systems, and external events impacting daily operations. The Company identifies, evaluates, and mitigates major risks in each work unit through risk profiles, with annual reviews of risk levels and control adequacy. Specific operational risk management includes internal controls over project development phases to ensure timeliness, quality, and cost efficiency, monitored via customer acceptance ratios. For IT-related risks, the Company has an IT Disaster Recovery Plan (ITDRP) established since 2014, providing frameworks and strategies to restore IT infrastructure and services after disruptions. The Risk Management and Sustainability Unit oversees risk management implementation, including periodic reviews, socialization of risk processes, and physical visits to priority locations to enhance risk assessment capabilities.

| Financial Risks | Financial risks identified include market risks such as interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. Interest rate risk arises mainly from bank loans; the Company manages this by balancing fixed and variable rate debts and evaluating market rates before borrowing. Foreign exchange risk is limited as most transactions are in Indonesian Rupiah, with foreign currency transactions only for special purposes and regularly reviewed. Credit risk stems from customers and counterparties failing to meet obligations; the Company mitigates this by placing cash and investments with reputable financial institutions, imposing fines for late payments, requiring advance rent and security deposits, and conducting credit verification for hotel room receivables. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, monitoring cash flows, and assessing financial market conditions for funding opportunities. The Company’s financial liabilities are classified and managed prudently, with disclosures on maturity profiles. Overall, the Company applies prudent financial risk management policies to minimize potential losses. | Financial risks include market risk (interest rate and foreign exchange risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk. Interest rate risk primarily relates to bank loans; the Company manages this risk by balancing fixed and variable rate debts and assessing creditor interest rates to secure favorable terms. Sensitivity analysis shows that a 1% increase in Rupiah-denominated loan interest rates could reduce net profit by approximately Rp94.34 billion in 2023. Foreign exchange risk is limited due to predominant use of Rupiah in transactions; foreign currency exposure is regularly reviewed, with potential impacts quantified (e.g., a Rp1,000 change in Rupiah against USD and SGD could affect comprehensive income by Rp26.5 billion in 2023). Credit risk arises from customers and counterparties failing to meet obligations; mitigated by placing funds with reputable banks and financial institutions, imposing penalties for late payments, requiring advance payments and security deposits, and maintaining credit verification policies. The Company recognizes expected credit losses on financial assets using historical loss experience adjusted for current and forecasted economic conditions. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, monitoring cash flows, and securing funding sources. The Company also manages capital structure to maintain healthy ratios, with gearing ratios monitored regularly. Hedging strategies include natural hedging against foreign currency exposure and sensitivity analyses for interest rate fluctuations. Financial liabilities are primarily measured at amortized cost, including bank loans, bonds, trade payables, and lease liabilities. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks include adherence to regulatory requirements, legal obligations, and anti-corruption laws.

The Company also maintains policies on vendor conduct and ensures compliance with capital market regulations through the Corporate Secretary. These measures aim to mitigate legal and regulatory risks effectively. | Compliance risks stem from changes in laws and regulations, adherence to government and local regulations, and potential legal disputes. The Company actively communicates and maintains good relations with relevant authorities and property associations, monitoring legislative changes and compliance requirements. It has enhanced compliance with Anti-Money Laundering and Prevention of Terrorism Financing regulations by updating policies and procedures and registering independently with the GoAML application. The Company enforces a Code of Conduct requiring all employees to comply with laws, regulations, and internal policies, with annual acknowledgments and strict consequences for violations. A whistleblowing system is in place to report breaches confidentially, with protection against retaliation.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | PT BUMI SERPONG DAMAI Tbk faces several economic challenges in 2024 and looking forward to 2025. Key challenges include the combination of inflation and rising interest rates, with Bank Indonesia increasing the benchmark interest rate to 6.25% in April 2024, which raised borrowing costs including mortgages (KPR) and apartment ownership loans (KPA). This increase potentially suppresses consumer purchasing power, especially for those relying on mortgages, and contributes to rising prices of building materials and project operational costs, creating a difficult environment for developers to balance profitability and consumer attraction. Additionally, there is a noted decline in demand for mortgages due to higher borrowing costs, impacting the property sector significantly. The global economic environment adds further uncertainty, with geopolitical conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war and Middle East tensions disrupting supply chains, increasing energy and food prices, and slowing global economic growth. These global instabilities may reduce domestic purchasing power, increase poverty, and cause foreign investment outflows. Nationally, limited land availability, especially in urban areas, remains a classic challenge, pushing developers to explore vertical projects or less conventional land. The company also anticipates challenges from rising raw material prices and economic uncertainties in 2025, including varying economic growth projections from institutions like IMF and Bank Indonesia, reflecting complex influencing factors such as global economic developments, domestic demand, and new government policies. The company has responded with risk management strengthening, product diversification, strategic partnerships, and operational efficiency improvements to mitigate these economic challenges. | The Company faces several economic challenges and uncertainties in 2023 and looking forward to 2024. Key economic challenges include the increase in Bank Indonesia (BI) interest rates, which rose twice by 25 basis points each to reach 6% in October 2023. This increase impacts property demand as most purchases are financed through mortgages (KPR or KPA), making instalments more expensive and potentially reducing demand. Additionally, the global economy in 2023 experienced a slowdown with growth expected at 3.0%, driven by geopolitical conflicts disrupting supply chains, rising energy and food prices, tightening monetary policies in developed countries, and the El Nino phenomenon affecting food production. These factors have led to high inflationary pressures. At the national level, these global economic issues have caused a decline in purchasing power, increased poverty, and heightened risks of economic crisis. The Company also notes challenges from licensing and bureaucratic issues, high lending rates, and delayed tax incentives affecting property sales decisions. The property sector is expected to remain sluggish in early 2024 due to these factors and political election-related fluctuations. To mitigate these risks, the Company has increased prudence in expansion and implemented strong risk management. Inflation, high interest rates, and global economic uncertainties remain key factors influencing revenue and profitability. The Company also faces cost pressures from rising prices in cost of goods sold and operating expenses, which have pressured gross and operating profit margins. Despite these challenges, the Company has implemented aggressive marketing strategies and product innovations to sustain growth. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The company faces intensified competitive pressures in the Indonesian property industry, driven by an increasing number of new developers and new property projects, which heighten competition for market share. Developers are compelled to continuously innovate and offer attractive products with added value to maintain competitiveness. The evolving consumer preferences towards sustainable, healthy, and quality residential products require the company to innovate in design and project development to meet modern expectations. Technological disruption and digital economic growth opportunities are also recognized, with the company leveraging initiatives such as the Digital Hub in BSD City to strengthen its market position. The company actively pursues strategic collaborations and partnerships to enhance its offerings and market reach. Despite a positive business outlook, the Board of Commissioners acknowledges the need to anticipate challenges from intensifying competition and global economic uncertainties in 2025. The company’s strategic focus includes strengthening marketing and sales strategies, exploring new business opportunities, increasing product innovation, and maintaining operational agility to adapt to dynamic market conditions and sustain its leadership position. | The 2023 annual report does not explicitly discuss competitive pressures or threats from established industry players or new disruptive entrants. However, the Company emphasizes its strong reputation, extensive network, high-quality development, and product innovation as key competitive advantages. It highlights its position as a leading integrated township developer with award-winning projects and strategic partnerships with government, construction companies, and professionals. The Company also focuses on innovation in product offerings, including modern and sustainable green building concepts, to meet evolving market demands. Marketing strategies such as the Sinar Mas Land Precious loyalty program and the national 'Smart Move' promotion are used to maintain market position and customer loyalty. The Company targets wider consumer segments, including those not previously addressed by competitors, and leverages digital and traditional media for promotion. While competitive dynamics and technological disruptions are not directly addressed as challenges, the Company’s strategic focus on innovation, quality, and partnerships suggests an awareness of the need to remain adaptive and competitive in the evolving property market. |
