# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Jaya Real Property Tbk's revenue showed a consistent upward trend from IDR 2,258,974,450 thousand in 2022 to IDR 2,503,645,371 thousand in 2023, and further to IDR 2,948,078,235 thousand in 2024, representing a growth of approximately 10.8% from 2022 to 2023 and 17.7% from 2023 to 2024. However, the gross margin declined from 57.53% in 2022 to 58.42% in 2023, then decreased to 55.51% in 2024, indicating some pressure on cost of goods sold relative to revenue despite revenue growth. Revenue by product/service highlights that the landed housing segment is the dominant contributor, increasing from approximately IDR 1.87 trillion in 2023 to IDR 2.02 trillion in 2024, while other segments such as retail and sport center/recreational activities also showed significant increases, notably the sport center segment which grew by 170.07% from IDR 59.79 billion in 2023 to IDR 161.41 billion in 2024. Geographic revenue data is not available for detailed regional analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a slight decline from 42.72% in 2022 to 44.27% in 2023, then decreased to 42.10% in 2024, reflecting a marginal reduction in operating efficiency despite revenue growth. Operating income increased from IDR 965,074,204 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,108,442,407 thousand in 2023 and further to IDR 1,241,020,954 thousand in 2024, indicating strong absolute operating profit growth. Operating expenses rose from IDR 341,171,653 thousand in 2022 to IDR 363,854,526 thousand in 2023 and IDR 411,300,949 thousand in 2024, suggesting increased cost management challenges as expenses grew faster than revenue in percentage terms, which may have contributed to the slight margin compression. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 1.47% in 2022 to 1.62% in 2023 and further to 2.71% in 2024, indicating a rising tax burden that slightly reduced net profitability. Despite this, net profit margin remained relatively stable, moving from 38.95% in 2022 to 40.91% in 2023 and slightly decreasing to 39.05% in 2024, supported by strong operating income growth.

Shareholders' equity improved by 7.4% to IDR 9,270,835,010 thousand, supported by retained earnings growth of 9.6%.

However, the current ratio declined from 100.89% to 87.47%, suggesting a slight reduction in short-term liquidity, which warrants monitoring. Overall, the company maintains a strong equity base and manageable liabilities, supporting financial health in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The companyâ€™s revenue increased by 17.7% to IDR 2,948,078,235 thousand in 2024 from IDR 2,503,645,371 thousand in 2023, driven by growth across key segments such as landed housing (up to IDR 2.02 trillion) and hotel segment (more than tripled to IDR 91.3 billion). Gross profit rose by 11.9% to IDR 1,636,487,981 thousand, though the gross margin declined from 58.42% to 55.51%, indicating some pressure on cost of goods sold which increased by 26%.

Gross profit rose by 12.5% to IDR 1,462,614,390 thousand, resulting in a higher gross margin of 58.42% compared to 57.53% in 2022, indicating effective cost management relative to sales.

Interest expense dramatically decreased, improving interest coverage to an exceptionally high 638,253.68%, indicating minimal financial burden from debt costs. Overall, earnings quality and profitability improved significantly in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed positive trends with asset turnover increasing to 21.59% from 19.67%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Cost control appears challenged as cost of goods sold grew faster (26%) than revenue (17.7%), contributing to margin compression. Operating expenses increased by 13.1%, slightly outpacing revenue growth, which also pressured operating margins. Net cash from operations improved modestly by 3.1% to IDR 947,171,423 thousand, supporting operational cash flow sustainability. Inventories increased by 8% to IDR 2,987,203,052 thousand, which may reflect higher stock levels to support sales growth but could also indicate slower inventory turnover. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, enhancing liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities showed a significant reduction in outflows to IDR (173,926,836) thousand from (809,044,084) thousand, indicating lower investment spending or asset acquisitions. Overall, operational efficiency improved in asset utilization and cash flow generation but cost pressures warrant monitoring. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed signals. While revenue and profit margins improved, net cash from operations decreased by 7.3% to IDR 918,049,944 thousand from IDR 990,441,047 thousand in 2022, indicating some challenges in converting earnings into cash. The companyâ€™s asset turnover ratio was strong at 19.67, suggesting high efficiency in using assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses increased modestly by 6.7%, which is controlled relative to revenue growth of 10.8%. Inventories were reported at IDR 2,764,402,297 thousand in 2023 (not available in 2022), which may impact working capital and cash flow management. The current ratio declined to 87.47%, reflecting tighter liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities showed increased outflows of IDR (809,044,084) thousand, indicating higher investment spending. Financing cash outflows remained stable. The decrease in net cash and current ratio suggests the company should monitor working capital and cash conversion cycles closely to maintain operational efficiency. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators suggest a low risk profile for 2024. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 39.36%, reflecting reduced leverage and a stronger equity base. The current ratio improved to 105.56%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity and ability to meet current liabilities. Interest expense dropped significantly to IDR 62,368 thousand from IDR 173,668 thousand, while interest coverage ratio surged to 1,989,836%, demonstrating an extremely comfortable ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased to 2.71%, which is still low but higher than the prior year, potentially affecting net income. No significant increases in liabilities or cash flow stress are evident. The modest increase in inventories and current liabilities should be monitored but do not currently indicate elevated risk. Overall, the company maintains a strong liquidity and solvency position with minimal financial risk. | Financial risk indicators for 2023 suggest a low risk profile. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at 42.46%, indicating moderate leverage without significant increase in financial risk. Interest expense dropped sharply to IDR 173,668 thousand from IDR 2,679,327 thousand in 2022, resulting in an extraordinarily high interest coverage ratio of 638,253.68%, signaling very strong ability to meet interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 1.62% but remains low, minimizing tax-related risks. However, the current ratio fell below 100% to 87.47%, which may indicate potential liquidity pressure in the short term. The increase in inventories and current liabilities also suggests some working capital risk. No other explicit risks such as large financing inflows or outflows were noted. Overall, the companyâ€™s financial risk remains low with strong coverage and manageable leverage, but liquidity should be monitored. |
| Future financial performance projection | The companyâ€™s future financial performance appears sustainable with positive indicators. The significant reduction in net cash used for investing activities to IDR (173,926,836) thousand from (809,044,084) thousand suggests a more cautious or completed investment phase, potentially preserving cash. Net cash from operations increased, supporting ongoing operational cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments increased to IDR (309,857,258) thousand, reflecting a stable or growing dividend policy that may attract investors. Revenue growth across diverse segments, especially in landed housing, hotel, and recreational activities, indicates potential for continued top-line expansion. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional growth insights. The improved liquidity and capital structure support capacity for future investments or debt management. Overall, the company is positioned for steady financial performance with balanced investment and shareholder return strategies. | Looking ahead, PT Jaya Real Property Tbkâ€™s increased investment activity is evident from the higher net cash outflow in investing activities (IDR (809,044,084) thousand in 2023 vs. (505,389,322) thousand in 2022), likely supporting asset growth and future revenue streams. The companyâ€™s strong profitability and high asset turnover ratio suggest sustainable cash flow generation potential. Dividend payments increased slightly to IDR (272,645,961) thousand, indicating a stable dividend policy that balances shareholder returns with reinvestment needs. Revenue diversification across multiple segments such as landed housing (IDR 1.87 trillion), retail, sports, hotel, and estate management segments provides geographic and product breadth, which may reduce risk and support growth. The companyâ€™s focus on Greater Jakarta and Semarang regions, though specific regional revenue data is unavailable, suggests concentration in key urban markets. Overall, the company appears well-positioned for continued financial performance improvement, supported by ongoing investments and diversified revenue streams, but should maintain focus on liquidity and working capital management. |

| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces several economic challenges including the increase in Bank Indonesia (BI) Rate from 6% to 6.25% in the first half of 2024, which led to higher mortgage interest rates and weakened purchasing power, resulting in a slowdown in sales growth for the mid-segment housing market. Oversupply and buyer preferences negatively impacted the condominium sector, with consumers favoring landed houses over apartments, causing lower demand for condominiums. Inflationary pressures persist, and supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates, and deflation are identified as major challenges to achieving accelerated economic growth. The Indonesian middle class has shrunk from 57 million in 2019 to 47.9 million in 2024, reducing consumer purchasing power and impacting retail growth. Geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainties, including the Ukraine-Russia conflict and political instability in the Middle East, contribute to an uncertain macroeconomic environment.

The Company remains focused on cost management, operational efficiency, product innovation with environmentally friendly designs, and leveraging digital marketing to sustain growth amid these economic pressures. | The domestic economy in 2023 was impacted by global headwinds, notably the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, higher interest rates, rising energy prices, and a strong US dollar, which posed significant challenges for local businesses and contributed to a subdued property market early in the year.

The real estate sector grew modestly by 1.43% in 2023, with uneven house price growth across Indonesia, though prices in Greater Jakarta and Banten increased by 2.56% in Q4. The government provided support through VAT exemptions for low- and mid-priced new homes and extended loan-to-value ratio relaxations for home loans until end-2023, with VAT incentives continuing at reduced levels in 2024. The retail sector recovery was slower than expected, with mall occupancy and visitor numbers below pre-pandemic levels, pressured by the rise of online shopping. Key downside risks for 2024 include ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, diminished global demand, and potential prolonged high interest rates in major economies that could suppress global demand and pressure Indonesia's exports.
