# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue increased from IDR 2,258,974,450 thousand in 2022 to IDR 2,948,078,235 thousand in 2024, representing a compound growth of approximately 13.1% from 2022 to 2023 and 17.7% from 2023 to 2024. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) also rose from IDR 959,311,542 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,311,590,254 thousand in 2024, but at a slower pace relative to revenue, which contributed to gross profit growth from IDR 1,299,662,908 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,636,487,981 thousand in 2024. However, gross margin declined from 57.53% in 2022 to 55.51% in 2024, indicating a slight erosion in cost efficiency or pricing power. Revenue by product/service shows that Sales of Land and Building is the dominant contributor, growing from IDR 1,765,098,249 thousand in 2022 to IDR 2,077,719,296 thousand in 2024, a 17.7% increase over two years. Rental revenue showed a strong increase of 74.9% from IDR 518,544,383 thousand in 2022 to IDR 906,876,323 thousand in 2024, indicating expansion or higher utilization in this segment. Estate Management and Hotel revenues also increased steadily, while Oceanarium revenue appeared only in 2023 and grew significantly by 1091% from 2023 to 2024 (from IDR 8,760,873 thousand to IDR 104,396,805 thousand), suggesting a new or rapidly expanding business line. Other smaller segments such as Service Charge, Parking and Others, Ice Rink, Sports Club, Driving Range, and Water Park showed moderate growth or stability. Geographic revenue data is not available, so no analysis on regional distribution or shifts can be made. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from IDR 965,074,204 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,241,020,954 thousand in 2024, reflecting a growth of 28.6% over two years, which is slightly higher than revenue growth, indicating improved absolute operating profitability. However, operating margin declined slightly from 42.72% in 2022 to 42.10% in 2024, with a peak at 44.27% in 2023, suggesting some margin pressure or increased operating expenses. Operating expenses increased from IDR 363,854,526 thousand in 2023 to IDR 411,300,949 thousand in 2024, a 13% increase, which may have contributed to the margin compression. The relationship between operating income and revenue remains strong, with operating income representing over 42% of revenue consistently, indicating effective operational leverage. Cost management appears moderately effective as gross margin declined but operating margin remained relatively stable, implying that the company managed to control operating expenses despite rising COGS. The increase in operating expenses in 2024 warrants monitoring for potential impact on future margins. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate is negative and increased in magnitude from (1.62%) in 2023 to (2.71%) in 2024, indicating tax benefits or credits that positively impacted net profit. This negative tax expense contributed to net profit margins remaining strong at 39.05% in 2024, slightly down from 40.91% in 2023 but above 2022's 38.95%. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the provided financials. External factors affecting profitability cannot be directly assessed due to lack of geographic revenue data and absence of notes on market or economic conditions. The tax benefit may reflect strategic tax planning or one-off tax adjustments that enhanced net profitability in 2023 and 2024. |

Gross profit rose by 12.5% to IDR 1,462,614,390 thousand, supported by a gross margin improvement from 57.53% to 58.42%, indicating effective cost control relative to sales. Operating income increased by 14.9% to IDR 1,108,442,407 thousand, with operating margin expanding from 42.72% to 44.27%, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency. Net profit grew by 16.5% to IDR 1,024,337,528 thousand, with net profit margin improving from 38.95% to 40.91%, signaling strong bottom-line performance. Return on equity was 11.44% and return on assets 8.05%, demonstrating reasonable returns on invested capital and asset base. The effective tax rate was negative at -1.62%, likely due to tax benefits or credits, which positively impacted net earnings. Overall, earnings quality appears robust with sustainable profitability improvements and margin expansions. |
| Operational efficiency | The company maintained strong operational efficiency in 2024. Asset turnover improved from 19.67% to 21.59%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses increased by 13.1%, but operating margin remained robust at 42.10%. Net cash from operations rose modestly by 3.2% to IDR 947,171,423 thousand, supporting working capital needs. Inventories increased by 8.0%, consistent with revenue growth and possibly reflecting inventory buildup for future sales. The current ratio improvement to 105.56% suggests better liquidity management. Overall, cost control and asset utilization remained effective, supporting operational performance. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023 as evidenced by an increase in operating margin to 44.27% from 42.72% in 2022, indicating better cost control and expense management. The asset turnover ratio was notably high at 19.67, suggesting very efficient use of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations decreased from IDR 990,441,047 thousand in 2022 to IDR 918,049,944 thousand in 2023, indicating some reduction in cash generation despite higher profits. Working capital management appears tighter as current assets decreased and current liabilities increased, contributing to a lower current ratio of 87.47%. Inventories were reported at IDR 2,764,402,297 thousand in 2023 (not available in 2022), which may impact working capital dynamics. Overall, the company shows strong operational efficiency in profitability and asset utilization but faces some challenges in cash flow and liquidity management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a stable risk profile. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 39.36% from 42.46%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk.

Interest expense data is unavailable, so interest coverage cannot be assessed. The effective tax rate increased negatively to -2.71%, which may suggest tax benefits or credits impacting earnings but requires monitoring. No significant increase in non-current liabilities was observed, maintaining manageable long-term obligations. Overall, leverage and liquidity trends suggest controlled financial risk with no immediate early warning signs. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show moderate leverage with a debt to equity ratio of 42.46%, slightly higher than 41.93% in 2022, indicating stable but cautious use of debt financing. The current ratio declined to 87.47% from 100.89%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity and potential pressure on meeting current obligations. Interest expense data is unavailable, and interest coverage cannot be assessed, which limits evaluation of interest payment risk. The effective tax rate was negative at -1.62%, which may reflect tax credits or adjustments but could also indicate volatility in tax obligations. The net cash from financing activities remained negative but stable, suggesting ongoing debt repayments or dividend payments. Overall, the company maintains moderate financial risk with manageable leverage but should monitor liquidity tightening and tax-related impacts. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a marked reduction in net cash used for investing from IDR (809,044,084) thousand in 2023 to IDR (173,926,836) thousand, indicating a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset purchases, which may support near-term cash flow sustainability. Net cash from financing activities also decreased in outflow to IDR (306,765,818) thousand, reflecting lower financing repayments or dividend distributions. Dividends increased to IDR (309,857,258) thousand, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns. The positive net increase in cash of IDR 466,478,769 thousand contrasts with a cash decrease in 2023, enhancing liquidity for future operations. Revenue growth across key segments such as Rental, Oceanarium, and Hotel indicates potential for continued expansion. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. Overall, the company appears positioned for stable future financial performance with prudent investment and dividend policies. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 as net cash from investing activities increased in outflow from IDR (505,389,322) thousand in 2022 to IDR (809,044,084) thousand, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting future growth. Despite this, net cash from operations declined, and cash reserves decreased by IDR 290,444,408 thousand, reflecting cash flow sustainability challenges. Dividend payments increased slightly to IDR (272,645,961) thousand, showing a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue growth was broad-based across product lines, with notable increases in sales of land and building, rental, and estate management segments, and new revenue from oceanarium operations, suggesting geographic or segment expansion. These trends imply the company is investing for growth while maintaining profitability, but cash flow management will be critical to support ongoing investments and dividend policy. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The company faces several economic challenges including rising interest rates, specifically Bank Indonesia raising the BI Rate from 6% to 6.25% in the first half of 2024, which increased mortgage interest rates and weakened purchasing power, leading to a slowdown in mid-segment housing sales growth. Oversupply and changing buyer preferences negatively impacted the condominium sector, with consumers favoring landed houses over apartments, resulting in lower demand for condominiums. Inflationary pressures persist, and supply chain disruptions and deflation are also noted as significant challenges. The global economy remains tense due to geopolitical conflicts such as the Ukraine-Russia war and Middle East tensions, contributing to economic uncertainties. Additionally, the Indonesian middle class has shrunk, reducing consumer spending and retail growth. Despite government incentives like VAT incentives and relaxed loan-to-value mortgage policies, the company anticipates challenges from declining purchasing power and rising interest rates in 2025. The company is focused on cost management, operational efficiency, and product innovation to sustain growth amid these economic conditions. | The company faces several economic challenges and uncertainties in 2023 and looking forward to 2024. Key economic challenges include the ongoing global geopolitical tensions, particularly the Russia-Ukraine war, which have led to higher interest rates, rising energy prices, and a strong US dollar impacting local businesses. These factors contributed to a subdued property market in early 2023 and a slow recovery in retail sector occupancy and visitor traffic, with consumer preference shifting towards online shopping. Inflation remained controlled within Bank Indonesia's target range at 2.6%, but risks persist from prolonged high interest rates in major economies potentially suppressing global demand and pressuring Indonesia's exports. The real estate sector grew modestly by 1.43% in 2023, with uneven growth across regions. The government’s VAT incentives for new homes and relaxed loan-to-value ratios have supported demand, especially in the middle and upper market segments. However, weak purchasing power and oversupply negatively affected the condominium segment. The company anticipates stable domestic economic growth around 5.2% in 2024, supported by strong private consumption and structural reforms, but remains cautious about external shocks and global demand uncertainties. Cost pressures are managed through disciplined cost control and operational efficiency. The company also faces challenges from fluctuating foreign exchange rates and interest rate risks, though exposures are managed prudently. Overall, economic uncertainties from global geopolitical tensions, market conditions, cost pressures, and shifting consumer behavior pose ongoing challenges to revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The company faces competitive pressures from market dynamics including oversupply in the condominium sector and shifting consumer preferences favoring landed houses. The real estate market is undergoing digital transformation with the rise of Property Technology (PropTech), which is revolutionizing traditional real estate transactions and increasing market competition. The company competes with both established players and new entrants leveraging technology and sustainable development trends. To address these pressures, the company employs multi-channel digital marketing strategies, enhances product value through attractive and environmentally friendly designs, and improves accessibility and amenities such as feeder buses, swimming pools, and gyms. The company also focuses on strategic location development, tenant mix optimization in retail properties, and selective leasing to high-quality commercial tenants to strengthen its market position. The evolving preferences of millennial and Gen Z customers for smart home technology and flexible living spaces further intensify competitive challenges. | The company operates in a competitive environment with pressures from established industry players and new market entrants. In the retail segment, competition from online shopping platforms continues to intensify, challenging physical retail outlets and trade centers despite the easing of pandemic restrictions. To counter this, the company revitalizes malls and trade centers through events, tenant mix optimization, and enhanced digital marketing. In the residential property market, the company faces competition in both landed houses and condominiums, with consumer preference strongly favoring landed houses over condominiums, leading to weaker demand in the latter segment. The company addresses this by continuously enhancing the value of its development areas, offering innovative and affordable products tailored to middle and upper market segments, and leveraging strategic locations and transit-oriented development concepts. The company also competes by providing high-quality amenities, sustainable construction, and integrated community infrastructure to differentiate its offerings. Technological disruption is addressed through extensive use of digital marketing and online sales channels to engage millennial and Gen Z buyers.
