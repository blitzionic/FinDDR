# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue increased from IDR 2,258,974,450 thousand to IDR 2,948,078,235 thousand, representing a compound growth of approximately 13.5% from 2022 to 2023 and 17.7% from 2023 to 2024. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) also rose from IDR 959,311,542 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,311,590,254 thousand in 2024, but at a slower pace relative to revenue, which contributed to gross profit growth from IDR 1,299,662,908 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,636,487,981 thousand in 2024. However, gross margin declined from 57.53% in 2022 to 55.51% in 2024, indicating slightly increased cost pressure or changes in product mix. Revenue by product/service shows that Sales of Land and Building dominate, growing from IDR 1,765,098,249 thousand in 2022 to IDR 2,077,719,296 thousand in 2024, a 17.7% increase over two years. Rental income also increased significantly by 62.1% from IDR 222,904,936 thousand in 2022 to IDR 361,226,658 thousand in 2024. Estate Management and Oceanarium revenues grew notably, with Oceanarium revenue appearing in 2023 and surging to IDR 104,396,805 thousand in 2024 from IDR 8,760,873 thousand in 2023, indicating a new or expanded business line. Other smaller segments such as Hotel, Service Charge, Parking and Others, Ice Rink, Sports Club, Driving Range, and Water Park showed moderate growth or stability. Geographic revenue data is not available, limiting regional analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from IDR 965,074,204 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,241,020,954 thousand in 2024, reflecting strong absolute growth. Operating margin slightly declined from 42.72% in 2022 to 42.10% in 2024, after peaking at 44.27% in 2023, suggesting some margin pressure despite revenue growth. Operating expenses rose from IDR 341,171,653 thousand in 2022 to IDR 411,300,949 thousand in 2024, an increase of about 20.6%, which is lower than revenue growth, indicating relatively effective cost management. The ratio of operating income to revenue remains robust above 40%, demonstrating efficient conversion of revenue into operating profit. Overall, the company shows good operational performance with controlled expense growth, though slight margin compression suggests potential areas for further efficiency improvements. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 1.47% in 2022 to 2.71% in 2024, more than doubling over the period, which slightly reduced net profitability despite rising pre-tax income. Income tax expense rose from IDR 13,088,829 thousand in 2022 to IDR 32,092,770 thousand in 2024, consistent with the higher tax rate and increased earnings. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the data provided. External factors affecting profitability cannot be directly assessed due to lack of geographic revenue data and absence of notes on market or regulatory impacts. The low effective tax rate overall suggests favorable tax conditions or incentives, but the upward trend warrants monitoring for future impact on net margins. |

| Operational efficiency | The company maintained strong operational efficiency in 2024. Despite a slight decline in operating margin to 42.10%, the asset turnover ratio improved from 19.67% to 21.59%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses increased by 13.1%, but this was offset by revenue growth of 17.7%, supporting higher operating income. Net cash from operations increased by 3.1% to IDR 947,171,423 thousand, reflecting solid cash generation capacity. Inventories rose by 8.0% to IDR 2,987,203,052 thousand, which may require monitoring for inventory management efficiency. The current ratio improvement to 105.56% also supports operational liquidity. Overall, the company demonstrated effective cost control and asset utilization, sustaining strong cash flow from operations. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023 as evidenced by an increase in asset turnover to 19.67, indicating more effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses increased moderately by 6.7% to IDR 363,854,526 thousand, which is well controlled relative to revenue growth of 10.8%. Operating margin improvement to 44.27% further supports enhanced cost control. However, net cash from operations declined by 7.3% to IDR 918,049,944 thousand, which may suggest some challenges in working capital management or cash conversion despite higher earnings. The current ratio decreased to 87.47%, reflecting tighter liquidity and potential working capital pressure. Inventories were reported at IDR 2,764,402,297 thousand in 2023 (not available in 2022), which may impact working capital dynamics. Overall, the company improved asset utilization and cost control but should monitor cash flow and working capital closely. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a favorable risk profile. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 39.36%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk.

The effective tax rate increased but remains low at 2.71%, posing minimal tax risk. Current liabilities increased slightly but were well covered by current assets, as shown by the improved current ratio. No significant liquidity or solvency concerns are evident.

The effective tax rate increased slightly to 1.62%, but remains very low, which may reflect tax planning or incentives. Liquidity risk is a concern as the current ratio fell below 1 to 87.47%, and net cash from operations declined, while current liabilities increased. The net decrease in cash of IDR 290,444,408 thousand also signals potential liquidity tightening. No significant increase in non-current liabilities was observed. Overall, the company maintains low financial risk from leverage and interest burden but should address liquidity and working capital risks. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a marked reduction in net cash used for investing from (IDR 809,044,084) thousand in 2023 to (IDR 173,926,836) thousand, suggesting a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset purchases, which may indicate a more conservative growth approach or completion of major investments.

Revenue growth was broad-based across product lines, notably sales of land and building increased by about 8.3%, and new revenue streams such as Oceanarium contributed IDR 8,760,873 thousand in 2023.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The company faces several economic challenges including rising interest rates, specifically Bank Indonesia raising the BI Rate from 6% to 6.25% in the first half of 2024, which increased mortgage interest rates and weakened consumer purchasing power, leading to a slowdown in mid-segment housing sales growth. Oversupply and changing buyer preferences negatively impacted the condominium sector, with consumers favoring landed houses over apartments, resulting in lower demand for condominiums. Inflationary pressures persist, and supply chain disruptions and deflation are also noted as significant challenges. The global economic environment remains tense due to geopolitical conflicts and uncertainties, including the Ukraine-Russia conflict and Middle East tensions, which contribute to market volatility. Additionally, the Indonesian middle class has shrunk, reducing consumer spending power and affecting retail growth. The property sector experienced modest growth with some contraction in residential property sales, particularly in compact houses. The company is responding with disciplined cost management, flexible payment schemes, product innovation focusing on affordability and environmental friendliness, and leveraging digital marketing to reach consumers. Government policies such as VAT incentives and relaxed loan-to-value ratios for mortgages provide some support but economic uncertainties remain, including fluctuating commodity prices and currency depreciation risks. | The company faces several economic challenges and uncertainties in 2023 and looking forward to 2024. Key economic challenges include the ongoing global geopolitical tensions, particularly the Russia-Ukraine war, which have led to higher interest rates, rising energy prices, and a strong US dollar impacting local businesses. These factors contributed to a subdued property market in early 2023 and a slow recovery in retail sector occupancy and visitor traffic, with continued pressure from online shopping trends. Inflation remained controlled within Bank Indonesia's target range at 2.6%, but risks persist from prolonged high interest rates in major economies potentially suppressing global demand and affecting Indonesia's exports. The real estate sector grew modestly by 1.43% in 2023, with uneven growth across regions, though prices in Greater Jakarta and Banten increased steadily. Government support through VAT exemptions and loan-to-value ratio relaxations helped stimulate demand, especially in the landed housing segment.

The company remains cautious about external shocks and economic uncertainties, emphasizing disciplined cost management and operational efficiency to sustain growth. Additionally, the company manages financial risks such as credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and foreign currency risk, with exposures generally considered immaterial or well controlled.

| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The company faces competitive pressures from market dynamics including oversupply in the condominium sector and shifting consumer preferences favoring landed houses, which challenges the company's condominium sales.
