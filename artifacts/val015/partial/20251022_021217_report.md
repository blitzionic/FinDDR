# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue showed a strong upward trend, increasing from IDR 2,258,974,450 thousand in 2022 to IDR 2,503,645,371 thousand in 2023 (an increase of approximately 10.8%), and further to IDR 2,948,078,235 thousand in 2024 (an increase of approximately 17.7% from 2023). Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) also rose from IDR 959,311,542 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,041,030,981 thousand in 2023 (an 8.6% increase), and then to IDR 1,311,590,254 thousand in 2024 (a 26% increase from 2023). Despite revenue growth, gross margin declined from 57.53% in 2022 to 58.42% in 2023, then dropped to 55.51% in 2024, indicating rising direct costs outpacing revenue growth in the latest year. Revenue by product/service reveals that Sales of Land and Building dominate, growing from IDR 1,765,098,249 thousand in 2022 to IDR 2,077,719,296 thousand in 2024, a 17.7% increase over two years. Rental income also increased significantly by 62.1% from IDR 222,904,936 thousand in 2022 to IDR 361,226,658 thousand in 2024. Notably, Oceanarium revenue appeared only in 2023 and 2024, surging from IDR 8,760,873 thousand in 2023 to IDR 104,396,805 thousand in 2024, indicating a new or expanded business line. Other smaller segments like Hotel, Service Charge, Parking and Others, Ice Rink, Sports Club, Driving Range, and Water Park showed moderate growth or stability. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased steadily from IDR 965,074,204 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,108,442,407 thousand in 2023 (a 14.9% increase), and further to IDR 1,241,020,954 thousand in 2024 (a 12% increase from 2023). Operating margin slightly declined from 42.72% in 2022 to 44.27% in 2023, then decreased to 42.10% in 2024, reflecting a minor deterioration in operating efficiency despite higher absolute operating income. Operating expenses rose from a negative figure in 2022 (IDR -341,171,653 thousand, possibly indicating a reversal or adjustment) to positive IDR 363,854,526 thousand in 2023 and further to IDR 411,300,949 thousand in 2024, suggesting increased operational costs. The relationship between operating income and revenue remains strong, with operating income growing in line with revenue but at a slightly slower rate in 2024, indicating some cost management challenges. Overall, the company maintains solid operating profitability but faces pressure on expense control. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted from a negative rate of -1.47% in 2022 to a low positive 1.62% in 2023 and increased further to 2.71% in 2024. This indicates the company moved from a tax benefit position in 2022 to paying taxes in subsequent years, slightly reducing net profitability. Income tax expense rose from a negative IDR 13,088,829 thousand in 2022 to positive IDR 16,838,667 thousand in 2023 and IDR 32,092,770 thousand in 2024, consistent with the tax rate trend. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data, but the negative operating expense in 2022 suggests a possible one-off adjustment that improved that year's operating results. External factors affecting profitability cannot be assessed due to lack of geographic revenue data and external context. |

| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed trends in 2024.

Asset turnover improved from 19.67% to 21.59%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased modestly by 3.1% to IDR 947,171,423 thousand, supporting operational cash flow sustainability. Inventories rose by 8.1% to IDR 2,987,203,052 thousand, which may suggest higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, contributing to a higher current ratio. Overall, the company enhanced asset utilization and maintained positive operating cash flow, though margin compression indicates room for improved cost management. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023 as evidenced by an increase in operating margin to 44.27% from 42.72% in 2022, indicating better cost control relative to revenue. The asset turnover ratio was high at 19.67, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations decreased from IDR 990,441,047 thousand in 2022 to IDR 918,049,944 thousand in 2023, indicating a slight decline in cash generation from core operations despite higher profits.

Inventories were reported at IDR 2,764,402,297 thousand in 2023 (not available in 2022), which may impact working capital and operational liquidity.

Interest expense was negligible at IDR 173,668 thousand, and interest coverage ratio was extremely high at 638,253.68%, reflecting very strong ability to cover interest costs and minimal financial risk from debt servicing. The effective tax rate moved from a negative rate in 2022 to a positive 1.62% in 2023, which may slightly increase tax-related cash outflows but does not pose significant risk. No significant increases in non-current liabilities were noted. Overall, the company maintains low financial risk with strong interest coverage but should monitor liquidity tightening. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a significant reduction in net cash used for investing from (IDR 809,044,084) thousand in 2023 to (IDR 173,926,836) thousand, indicating a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset purchases, which may suggest a more conservative investment approach or completion of major projects. Net cash from financing activities also decreased in outflow from (IDR 399,450,268) thousand to (IDR 306,765,818) thousand, reflecting lower financing repayments or dividend distributions. Dividends paid increased from (IDR 272,645,961) thousand to (IDR 309,857,258) thousand, signaling a commitment to returning value to shareholders. The net increase in cash turned positive to IDR 466,478,769 thousand from a negative cash flow in 2023, supporting cash flow sustainability.

Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. Overall, the company is positioned for stable future performance with controlled investment spending, sustained cash flow, and shareholder returns. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 as net cash from investing activities increased in outflow from IDR (505,389,322) thousand in 2022 to IDR (809,044,084) thousand, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions likely aimed at supporting future growth. Despite this, net cash from financing activities remained a cash outflow at IDR (399,450,268) thousand, slightly lower than 2022, with dividends paid increasing marginally to IDR (272,645,961) thousand, suggesting a stable dividend policy. The net decrease in cash of IDR (290,444,408) thousand in 2023 contrasts with a net increase in 2022, reflecting cash usage for investments and dividends exceeding operational cash inflows. Revenue growth was broad-based across product lines, including new revenue from Oceanarium at IDR 8,760,873 thousand, indicating geographic or segment expansion. These factors suggest the company is investing for growth while maintaining shareholder returns, but cash flow sustainability should be monitored given the negative net cash change in 2023. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces several economic challenges including rising interest rates, specifically Bank Indonesia raising the BI Rate from 6% to 6.25% in the first half of 2024, which increased mortgage interest rates and weakened purchasing power, leading to a slowdown in sales growth for the mid-segment housing market. Oversupply and changing buyer preferences negatively impacted the condominium sector, with consumers favoring landed houses over condominiums, resulting in lower apartment demand. Inflationary pressures persist, and supply chain disruptions and deflation are also noted as significant challenges. The global economy remains tense due to geopolitical conflicts such as the Ukraine-Russia war and Middle East tensions, contributing to economic uncertainties. Additionally, the Indonesian middle class has shrunk, reducing consumer spending and retail growth. Despite government incentives like VAT incentives and relaxed loan-to-value policies, the property sector growth remains modest, with residential property sales declining in 2024. The Company is focused on disciplined cost management, operational efficiency, and product innovation to sustain growth amid these economic headwinds. | The company faces several economic challenges and uncertainties in 2023 and looking forward to 2024. Key economic challenges include the ongoing global geopolitical tensions, particularly the Russia-Ukraine war, which have led to higher interest rates, rising energy prices, and a strong US dollar impacting local businesses. These factors contributed to a subdued property market in early 2023 and a slow recovery in retail sector occupancy and visitor traffic, with consumer preference shifting towards online shopping. Inflation remained controlled within Bank Indonesia's target range at 2.6%, but risks persist from prolonged high interest rates in major economies potentially suppressing global demand and pressuring Indonesia's exports. The real estate sector grew modestly by 1.43% in 2023, with uneven growth across regions, though prices in Greater Jakarta and Banten increased steadily. Government support through VAT exemptions and loan-to-value ratio relaxations helped stimulate demand, especially in the middle and upper market segments.
