# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue increased from IDR 2,258,974,450 thousand in 2022 to IDR 2,948,078,235 thousand in 2024, representing a compound growth of approximately 16.4% from 2022 to 2023 and 17.7% from 2023 to 2024. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) also rose from IDR 959,311,542 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,311,590,254 thousand in 2024, but at a slightly higher growth rate, which contributed to a decline in gross margin from 57.53% in 2022 to 55.51% in 2024. This indicates some pressure on direct costs relative to revenue growth. Revenue by product/service shows that Sales of Land and Building is the dominant contributor, growing from IDR 1,765,098,249 thousand in 2022 to IDR 2,077,719,296 thousand in 2024, a 17.7% increase over two years. Rental income also grew significantly by 62.1% from IDR 222,904,936 thousand in 2022 to IDR 361,226,658 thousand in 2024. Other segments such as Estate Management and Hotel also showed growth, while some categories like Condominium revenue disappeared in 2024, indicating possible divestment or reclassification. Geographic revenue data is not available, limiting analysis on regional distribution or shifts. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from IDR 965,074,204 thousand in 2022 to IDR 1,241,020,954 thousand in 2024, reflecting a steady improvement in absolute terms. However, the operating margin slightly declined from 42.72% in 2022 to 42.10% in 2024, with a peak of 44.27% in 2023, indicating a minor deterioration in operating efficiency in 2024. Operating expenses increased from a negative figure in 2022 (IDR -341,171,653 thousand, possibly due to accounting adjustments) to positive IDR 411,300,949 thousand in 2024, suggesting normalization or increased operational costs. Despite this, the company maintained strong operating profitability, with operating income representing a substantial portion of revenue (over 42%). Cost management appears challenged by rising expenses and slightly compressed margins, but overall operational performance remains robust. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted from a negative rate of -1.47% in 2022 to a positive 2.71% in 2024, indicating a transition from tax benefits or credits to actual tax expenses, which slightly reduced net profitability. Income tax expense increased from a negative IDR 13,088,829 thousand in 2022 to a positive IDR 32,092,770 thousand in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data, but the negative operating expense in 2022 suggests possible one-off accounting adjustments that normalized in subsequent years. External factors affecting profitability cannot be fully assessed due to lack of geographic revenue data and external environment details. |

This growth was primarily driven by a 12.9% increase in non-current assets, indicating ongoing investment in long-term resources. Current assets slightly decreased by 5.4%, which, combined with a rise in current liabilities by 9%, led to a decline in the current ratio from 100.89% in 2022 to 87.47% in 2023, suggesting a modest reduction in short-term liquidity.

The effective tax rate shifted from a negative rate in 2022 (-1.47%) to a positive 1.62% in 2023, normalizing tax expense recognition. Overall, earnings quality is robust with sustainable profitability improvements and enhanced margins. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased by 13.1% to IDR 411,300,949 thousand, slightly outpacing revenue growth, which contributed to a decrease in operating margin. Asset turnover improved from 19.67% to 21.59%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased modestly by 3.1% to IDR 947,171,423 thousand, supporting operational cash flow strength. Inventories rose by 8.0% to IDR 2,987,203,052 thousand, which may require monitoring for inventory management efficiency. The current ratio improvement to 105.56% suggests better working capital management. Overall, the company maintained good cost control and improved asset utilization, though operating expense growth slightly pressured margins. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023 as evidenced by an increase in operating margin to 44.27% from 42.72% in 2022, indicating better cost control relative to revenue. The asset turnover ratio was notably high at 19.67, suggesting very efficient use of assets to generate sales, although no prior year comparison is available. Despite a slight decline in net cash from operations to IDR 918,049,944 thousand from IDR 990,441,047 thousand in 2022, the company maintained strong cash flow generation. Inventories were reported at IDR 2,764,402,297 thousand in 2023, but no prior data is available for trend analysis. Working capital management appears slightly constrained given the decrease in current assets and increase in current liabilities, reflected in the lower current ratio. Overall, the company shows strong operational efficiency with high asset utilization and solid cash flow, though working capital liquidity requires monitoring. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators show a reduction in debt to equity ratio from 42.46% to 39.36%, indicating lower financial risk. Interest expense decreased significantly from IDR 173,668 thousand to IDR 62,368 thousand, while interest coverage ratio surged from 638,253.68% to 1,989,836.06%, reflecting an extremely strong ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased but remains low at 2.71%, posing minimal tax risk. Current liabilities increased slightly, but the current ratio improvement to 105.56% mitigates liquidity risk. No significant increase in non-current liabilities was observed. Overall, the company exhibits low financial risk with strong liquidity and minimal interest burden. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest moderate leverage and strong interest coverage. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at 42.46%, indicating consistent leverage without significant increase in financial risk. The current ratio declined to 87.47%, below 100%, signaling potential short-term liquidity pressure. Interest expense was minimal at IDR 173,668 thousand, resulting in an exceptionally high interest coverage ratio of 638,253.68%, down from an anomalously high figure in 2022 but still indicating negligible risk of interest payment default. The effective tax rate moved from a negative to a positive rate, which may reflect changes in tax obligations but remains low at 1.62%. No significant spikes in liabilities or cash flow issues were observed. Overall, the company maintains low financial risk with strong coverage and manageable leverage, though liquidity tightening warrants attention. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a significant reduction in net cash used for investing from (IDR 809,044,084) thousand in 2023 to (IDR 173,926,836) thousand in 2024, indicating a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset purchases, which may impact future growth. Net cash from financing activities also decreased in outflow from (IDR 399,450,268) thousand to (IDR 306,765,818) thousand, with dividends paid increasing from (IDR 272,645,961) thousand to (IDR 309,857,258) thousand, suggesting a stable or slightly more generous dividend policy. Revenue growth was supported by diversification in product/service lines, with notable increases in Rental, Oceanarium, and Hotel segments, indicating potential growth areas. The positive net increase in cash of IDR 466,478,769 thousand in 2024 versus a decrease in 2023 supports cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company is positioned for steady future performance with cautious investment spending and consistent dividend returns. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 as net cash used in investing increased to IDR (809,044,084) thousand from (505,389,322) thousand in 2022, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions likely supporting future growth. Despite this, net cash from operations declined slightly, and net cash from financing remained stable with a slight reduction in outflows. The company continued its dividend payments, increasing dividends paid to IDR (272,645,961) thousand, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue growth across most product lines, especially Sales of Land and Building and Rental segments, suggests positive market demand and geographic data is unavailable for further segmentation. The increase in non-current assets and retained earnings supports a growth-oriented strategy. Cash flow sustainability appears adequate but requires monitoring due to increased investing outflows and reduced operational cash inflows. Overall, the company is positioned for continued growth with active investment and stable dividend policy, though liquidity management will be critical going forward. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces several economic challenges including rising interest rates, specifically Bank Indonesia raising the BI Rate from 6% to 6.25% in the first half of 2024, which increased mortgage interest rates and weakened consumer purchasing power, leading to a slowdown in mid-segment housing sales growth. Oversupply and changing buyer preferences negatively impacted the condominium sector, with consumers favoring landed houses over apartments, resulting in lower demand for condominiums. Inflationary pressures persist, and supply chain disruptions and deflation are also noted as significant challenges. The global economy remains tense due to geopolitical conflicts such as the Ukraine-Russia war and Middle East tensions, contributing to economic uncertainties. Additionally, the Indonesian middle class has shrunk from 57 million in 2019 to 47.9 million in 2024, reducing consumer spending and retail growth. The real estate sector grew modestly at 1.43% in 2024, with housing prices rising moderately but sales declining, especially in the Jabodetabek-Banten area. The government has extended supportive policies like VAT incentives and relaxed loan-to-value ratios to stimulate the property market. The Company is focused on disciplined cost management, operational efficiency, and product innovation to navigate these economic challenges while monitoring inflation and market conditions prudently. | The company faces several economic challenges and uncertainties in 2023 and looking forward to 2024. Key economic challenges include the ongoing global geopolitical tensions, particularly the Russia-Ukraine war, which have led to higher interest rates, rising energy prices, and a strong US dollar impacting local businesses. These factors contributed to a subdued property market in early 2023 and a slow recovery in retail sector occupancy and visitor traffic, with consumer preference shifting towards online shopping. Inflation remained controlled within Bank Indonesia's target range at 2.6%, but risks persist from prolonged high interest rates in major economies potentially suppressing global demand and pressuring Indonesia's exports. The real estate sector grew modestly by 1.43% in 2023, with uneven house price growth across regions, though prices in Greater Jakarta and Banten increased steadily. Government support through VAT exemptions for low- and mid-priced homes and relaxed loan-to-value ratios helped stimulate demand, especially in the landed house segment. However, weak purchasing power and oversupply negatively affected the condominium market. The company anticipates stable domestic growth around 5% in 2024, driven by private consumption and urbanization, but remains cautious of external downside risks from geopolitical uncertainty and diminished global demand. Cost pressures are managed through disciplined cost control and operational efficiency, while capital expenditures increased significantly in 2023 due to new asset developments. The company also faces challenges from currency fluctuations and interest rate risks, though foreign currency exposure is immaterial and interest rate risk is managed through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Overall, economic uncertainties require the company to maintain agility and focus on execution and cost discipline to sustain growth and profitability. |
