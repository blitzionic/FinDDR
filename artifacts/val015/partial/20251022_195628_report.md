Revenue diversification expanded in 2023 with multiple new revenue streams including estate management, oceanarium, hotel, service charge, parking, ice rink, sports club, driving range, and water park, which may reduce dependency on core land and building sales and enhance future revenue stability. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional risk assessment.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | PT Jaya Real Property Tbk faces several economic challenges including the increase in Bank Indonesia (BI) Rate from 6% to 6.25% in the first half of 2024, which led to higher mortgage interest rates and weakened purchasing power, resulting in a slowdown in sales growth for the mid-segment housing market. Oversupply and buyer preferences negatively impacted the condominium sector, with consumers favoring landed houses over apartments, causing lower demand for condominiums. Inflationary pressures persist, and supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates, and deflation are identified as major challenges to achieving accelerated economic growth. The Indonesian middle class has decreased, reducing consumer spending and retail growth. The property sector grew modestly in 2024, with housing prices rising slightly but sales volume declining significantly in the Jabodetabek-Banten area. The company must manage cost pressures prudently and remain cautious amid declining purchasing power and rising interest rates projected for 2025. Global geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties, including fluctuating exchange rates and interest rate risks, also contribute to the challenging macroeconomic environment. The company is focused on operational efficiency, disciplined cost management, and leveraging digital marketing to sustain growth amid these economic uncertainties. | PT Jaya Real Property Tbk faced several economic challenges in 2023 and anticipates continuing uncertainties into 2024. Key economic challenges include the impact of global headwinds such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, higher interest rates, rising energy prices, and a strong US dollar, which subdued the property market early in 2023. Inflation remained controlled at around 2.6%, supported by Bank Indonesia's policies. The real estate sector grew modestly by 1.43% in 2023, with uneven growth across regions. The government provided support through VAT exemptions for low- and mid-priced new homes, which stimulated demand but also created high demand for ready stock that the company could not fully meet. The retail sector recovery was slower than expected, with mall occupancy and visitor numbers not returning to pre-pandemic levels, partly due to increased consumer preference for online shopping. For 2024, risks include ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, volatile commodity prices, slowing growth in key global economies (China and Japan), and the potential for prolonged high interest rates in major economies suppressing global demand, which could pressure Indonesia's exports. Domestically, the company expects stable economic growth around 5.2%, supported by strong private consumption and urbanization driving demand for affordable housing. The company plans to focus on disciplined cost management and execution to mitigate these economic uncertainties. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The company faces competitive pressures from both established players and new market dynamics, including the rise of online shopping platforms that challenge traditional retail outlets, necessitating revitalization of malls and trade centers through events, tenant mix optimization, and intensified social media promotion to attract foot traffic.
