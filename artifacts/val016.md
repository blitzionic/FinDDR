# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Intiland Development Tbk's revenue showed a declining trend from IDR 3,906,826 million in 2023 to IDR 2,553,285 million in 2024, down from IDR 3,148,755 million in 2022. Correspondingly, the gross margin decreased significantly from 40.59% in 2023 and 40.48% in 2022 to 30.76% in 2024, indicating increased cost pressure or lower pricing power. Revenue by product/service reveals a shift: landed residential revenue decreased from approximately IDR 861,503 million in 2023 to IDR 659,423 million in 2024, mixed-use & high-rise dropped sharply from IDR 2,027,851 million in 2023 to IDR 371,760 million in 2024, while industrial estate revenue increased substantially from IDR 246,205 million in 2023 to IDR 638,349 million in 2024. Recurring income grew from IDR 771,267 million in 2023 to IDR 883,754 million in 2024, with notable increases in sportclub & facilities and industrial estate recurring segments. All revenue is domestic, concentrated in Indonesia, with no geographic diversification changes over the period. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined sharply from 32.52% in 2023 and 30.78% in 2022 to 17.79% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating profitability. Operating income fell from IDR 1,270,469 million in 2023 to IDR 454,231 million in 2024, a drop consistent with the revenue decline but more pronounced in margin terms. Operating expenses increased slightly from IDR 305,316 million in 2022 to IDR 331,121 million in 2024, despite the revenue contraction, indicating less effective cost control or fixed cost absorption issues. The ratio of operating income to revenue weakened, signaling deteriorating operational efficiency and cost management challenges amid a shrinking top line. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate rose sharply from a negative (tax benefit) rate of -25.93% in 2022 to 11.23% in 2023 and further to 35.19% in 2024, significantly impacting net profitability. This increase in tax burden contributed to a net profit margin decline from 19.40% in 2023 to 10.33% in 2024 despite the operating income drop. Income tax expense increased from a negative IDR 67,194 million in 2022 to IDR 143,234 million in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Intiland Development Tbk's total assets decreased to IDR 13,703,553 million from IDR 14,603,908 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from IDR 4,734,770 million to IDR 3,870,567 million, while non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities also declined significantly from IDR 8,064,726 million to IDR 6,956,641 million, with both current liabilities and non-current liabilities decreasing, indicating a reduction in the company's obligations. Shareholders' equity increased slightly to IDR 6,746,912 million from IDR 6,539,181 million, supported by higher retained earnings (IDR 1,372,530 million vs. IDR 1,194,519 million). The current ratio decreased marginally from 114.02% to 108.02%, suggesting a slight weakening in short-term liquidity but still above 100%, indicating the company can cover its current liabilities with current assets. The debt to equity ratio improved from 123.33% to 103.11%, showing a healthier capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained a solid equity base with reduced liabilities and adequate liquidity in 2024, though total asset contraction signals cautious asset management or divestment. | In 2023, PT Intiland Development Tbk's total assets decreased to IDR 14,603,908 million from IDR 16,351,848 million in 2022, reflecting a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from IDR 6,459,626 million to IDR 4,734,770 million.

The debt to equity ratio improved markedly from 163.08% to 123.33%, suggesting a stronger capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company shows improved financial health with lower liabilities, stronger equity base, and better liquidity in 2023 compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company experienced a notable decline in profitability in 2024 compared to 2023. Revenue dropped sharply by approximately 34.6% from IDR 3,906,826 million to IDR 2,553,285 million. Correspondingly, gross profit halved from IDR 1,585,796 million to IDR 785,352 million, causing the gross margin to fall from 40.59% to 30.76%. Operating income declined more steeply by about 64%, from IDR 1,270,469 million to IDR 454,231 million, with operating margin contracting from 32.52% to 17.79%. Net profit dropped by approximately 65% to IDR 263,853 million, reducing net profit margin from 19.40% to 10.33%. Return on equity and return on assets also deteriorated significantly, with ROE falling from 11.89% to 3.97% and ROA from 4.90% to 1.86%, indicating lower earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets. The effective tax rate surged from 11.23% to 35.19%, which further compressed net profitability. Overall, 2024 saw a marked weakening in profitability and earnings quality driven by lower revenues, higher tax burden, and reduced margins. | Revenue increased substantially by approximately 24% from IDR 3,148,755 million in 2022 to IDR 3,906,826 million in 2023, driven by growth across key segments such as landed residential and mixed-use & high-rise properties. Gross profit rose by 24.4% to IDR 1,585,796 million, maintaining a stable gross margin of 40.59%, slightly up from 40.48% in 2022. Operating income increased by 31% to IDR 1,270,469 million, improving the operating margin to 32.52% from 30.78%. Net profit surged nearly fourfold to IDR 758,028 million, with net profit margin expanding significantly to 19.40% from 6.10%, reflecting improved earnings quality. Return on equity and return on assets were reported at 11.89% and 4.90% respectively, indicating effective utilization of equity and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate normalized to 11.23% from a negative rate in 2022, contributing to sustainable net earnings. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved markedly in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 declined relative to 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased in absolute terms but not proportionally to revenue, contributing to a lower gross margin of 30.76% from 40.59%. Operating expenses slightly increased from IDR 315,327 million to IDR 331,121 million, indicating less effective cost control amid shrinking revenues. Asset turnover ratio dropped from 25.24% to 18.04%, reflecting reduced efficiency in utilizing assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations improved significantly, turning positive to IDR 164,288 million from a negative IDR 94,263 million in 2023, signaling better cash generation from core business activities despite lower profitability. Inventories decreased from IDR 3,050,818 million to IDR 2,455,486 million, which may indicate improved inventory management or lower sales volume. Working capital management appears stable with a current ratio above 100%. However, net cash from investing activities turned negative at IDR -85,291 million compared to a positive inflow in 2023, suggesting increased investment or asset purchases. Net cash from financing activities remained negative but improved from -IDR 525,225 million to -IDR 281,179 million, indicating reduced financing outflows. Overall, operational efficiency weakened in terms of margin and asset utilization but cash flow from operations improved, supporting liquidity. | Cost of goods sold increased in line with revenue by 23.8% to IDR 2,321,031 million, maintaining gross margin stability. Operating expenses rose marginally by 3.3% to IDR 315,327 million, indicating effective cost control relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover was reported at 25.24%, reflecting efficient use of assets to generate sales. Despite improved profitability, net cash from operations remained negative but improved significantly from -IDR 443,659 million in 2022 to -IDR 94,263 million in 2023, indicating better operational cash flow management though still under pressure. Inventories decreased from IDR 4,106,860 million to IDR 3,050,818 million, suggesting improved inventory management or sales conversion. Overall, operational efficiency improved with controlled expenses, better asset utilization, and reduced operational cash outflows. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show mixed signals. Leverage decreased as evidenced by a lower debt to equity ratio of 103.11% from 123.33%, reducing financial risk related to indebtedness. The current ratio of 108.02% indicates adequate short-term liquidity, though slightly lower than the prior year. Interest expense decreased modestly from IDR 389,477 million to IDR 359,417 million, but interest coverage ratio dropped sharply from 326.20% to 126.38%, reflecting reduced operating income relative to interest costs and signaling increased risk in meeting interest obligations. The effective tax rate rose substantially from 11.23% to 35.19%, which could indicate changes in tax policy or less tax optimization, increasing the tax burden risk. The decline in profitability and margins, combined with lower asset turnover, may also heighten operational risk. No other explicit risk factors are noted in the data. Overall, while leverage and liquidity improved, the company faces increased earnings volatility and tax burden risks that could pressure financial stability if trends persist. | Leverage risk decreased as debt to equity ratio improved from 163.08% to 123.33%, reflecting reduced reliance on debt financing. Interest expense slightly decreased to IDR 389,477 million from IDR 408,134 million, while interest coverage ratio improved significantly to 326.20% from 237.48%, indicating stronger ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. Liquidity risk is mitigated by an improved current ratio of 114.02%. The effective tax rate shifted from a negative 25.93% in 2022 to a positive 11.23% in 2023, normalizing tax expense and reducing tax-related uncertainties. However, net cash from operations remains negative, which could pose liquidity risk if sustained. No other explicit financial risks are evident from the data. Overall, financial risk profile improved with lower leverage, better interest coverage, and normalized tax expense, but operational cash flow remains a concern. |
| Future financial performance projection | The 2024 financial data suggests cautious future performance. The company’s net cash from investing activities turned negative at IDR -85,291 million, indicating increased investment activity which may support future growth. However, net cash from financing activities remained negative at IDR -281,179 million, though improved from 2023, suggesting ongoing debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends increased from IDR 2,880,491,551 to IDR 3,134,935,791, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings, which may pressure cash flow sustainability. Revenue by segment shows a shift with mixed-use & high-rise revenue declining sharply, while industrial estate and recurring income segments increased, indicating potential strategic focus on more stable or growing segments. Recurring income, including rental space and sport club facilities, grew, which may provide steadier cash flows. Geographic revenue remains fully domestic, with a significant revenue decline overall, suggesting exposure to local market conditions. Given the reduced profitability and margins but improved operational cash flow and ongoing investments, the company appears to be balancing short-term challenges with strategic repositioning for future performance, though dividend policy may constrain cash reserves. | The company’s net cash from investing activities turned positive to IDR 411,312 million in 2023 from a negative IDR 177,774 million in 2022, indicating possible divestments or reduced capital expenditures, which may support liquidity. Net cash from financing activities was negative at IDR 525,225 million compared to a small positive in 2022, suggesting debt repayments or reduced external financing. Despite negative net cash from operations, the company maintained a stable dividend payout, slightly increasing dividends to IDR 2,880,492 million, signaling confidence in cash flow sustainability or strong dividend policy commitment. Revenue growth was driven by domestic Indonesian markets, with significant contributions from landed residential and mixed-use & high-rise segments, and new revenue streams such as hotel operations emerging in 2023. These factors suggest potential for continued revenue growth and profitability. However, ongoing negative operational cash flow and inventory levels warrant monitoring. Overall, the company appears positioned for stable future performance with cautious investment and financing strategies, supported by strong domestic market demand. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | PT Intiland Development Tbk faces several economic challenges and uncertainties in 2024 and looking forward to 2025. These include the impact of global economic slowdowns, geopolitical tensions, ongoing trade wars (notably between the US and China), and recession risks in Europe, which contribute to global market uncertainty. Domestically, political uncertainty related to the 2024 general elections affected consumer and investor confidence, causing delays in purchases and investments. Inflation and interest rate fluctuations remain risks that could impact the investment climate and property regulations. Although Indonesia's economy showed resilience with 5.03% growth in 2024 and controlled inflation at 1.57%, potential challenges include rising interest rates, exchange rate volatility, and global political dynamics that may affect market sentiment. The property sector faces sluggish sales in high-rise segments such as apartments and offices, with high inventory levels of ready-for-occupancy units pressuring cash flow. Consumer preference shifts toward landed housing and affordable units, driven by a large backlog of housing demand (~12.7 million units), while some subsectors like apartments and offices remain weak. The Company also contends with cost pressures including increased selling expenses and commissions. Overall, economic stability, government stimulus policies (e.g., PPN DTP tax incentives), and accommodative monetary policy provide a supportive environment, but uncertainties from both domestic and global factors require cautious and adaptive strategies. | PT Intiland Development Tbk faces several forward-looking economic challenges and uncertainties as outlined in the 2023 annual report. Globally, the company anticipates continued economic deceleration with geopolitical tensions and risks of recession in advanced economies, including economic weaknesses in China and the United States. Domestically, the 2024 political climate surrounding the General Elections introduces uncertainty affecting investment and consumer confidence. Inflation is expected to remain controlled around 2.5% ±1%, and Bank Indonesia projects moderate economic growth between 4.7% and 5.5% in 2024. However, the property market remains challenged by low buying interest and investment, especially in the high-rise residential segment, with prolonged decision-making by consumers due to economic and political uncertainties. The company also faces cost pressures from interest rates and bond yields, which may increase due to international economic policy changes. To mitigate these risks, Intiland adopts cautious financing policies, including requiring high purchase commitments before launching new projects, postponing launches when demand is insufficient, and focusing on lower-risk landed housing and industrial estate developments. The company also benefits from government incentives such as the VAT exemption (PPN DTP) to stimulate property purchases. Despite these measures, the company acknowledges that economic uncertainties, including inflation, interest rate fluctuations, and political stability, remain key factors that could impact revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Company faces competitive pressures from a highly competitive property development industry with multiple segments including high-rise, residential, industrial estates, and investment properties. Competition is intensified by other developers targeting similar locations and market segments. The high-rise property segment, particularly apartments and office leasing, remains challenging due to low absorption rates and slow buyer decision-making, partly influenced by cautious investor sentiment post-election. The Company employs joint ventures and strategic partnerships to enhance competitiveness and access resources. It also focuses on innovation in financing and marketing, including digital marketing, virtual tours, flexible payment schemes, and bundling with banks to attract buyers. The Company continuously monitors market trends and consumer preferences to adjust its portfolio and offerings. Despite these efforts, the sluggish recovery in high-rise and office segments, along with the need to reduce inventory and maintain occupancy rates (minimum 85% for office buildings), reflect ongoing competitive challenges. The Company’s strategic risk management includes careful project planning, diversification, and innovation to address intense competition and market dynamics. | The company faces competitive pressures primarily from market dynamics and shifting consumer preferences within the property sector. The high-rise residential market, particularly apartments and office units, remains stagnant with limited investor demand and prolonged buyer decision-making, posing challenges to sales and inventory management. Intiland has responded by focusing marketing and sales efforts on residential landed houses and industrial estate segments, which show more stable demand, especially from end-users. The company also notes that some competitors have shifted focus toward the lower middle-class market segment, reflecting changing market trends. Technological disruption is addressed through active digital marketing initiatives to enhance consumer reach. Strategic cooperation with landowners, investors, and capital owners is pursued to expand access to resources and optimize project value, risk management, and growth. The company leverages its long-standing experience, diversified portfolio, and innovation culture to maintain competitiveness. However, the property sector's capital-intensive nature and the need to adapt to evolving market conditions and consumer preferences continue to present competitive challenges. Intiland’s cautious approach to launching new high-rise projects and emphasis on joint ventures and strategic collaborations reflect its strategy to mitigate competitive risks and sustain market position. |
