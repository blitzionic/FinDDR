# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 saw a significant increase from 3,148,755 to 3,906,826, representing a growth of approximately 24.06%. However, in 2024, revenue decreased to 2,553,285, indicating a decline of about 34.61%. The gross margin has shown a downward trend, decreasing from 40.48% in 2022 to 40.59% in 2023, and further down to 30.76% in 2024. This decline in gross margin suggests increasing direct costs relative to revenue. In terms of product/service revenue breakdown, the most notable changes include a significant drop in revenue from 'Perumahan' from 861,503,453,161 in 2023 to 659,423,207,391 in 2024, and a decrease in 'High rise' from 2,027,851,190,779 in 2023 to 371,759,512,185 in 2024. The 'Kawasan industri' segment saw an increase from 246,204,745,386 in 2023 to 638,348,933,731 in 2024, indicating a shift in focus or demand. Other segments also experienced fluctuations, reflecting changing market dynamics. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin has decreased from 30.78% in 2022 to 32.52% in 2023, but fell sharply to 17.79% in 2024, indicating a deterioration in operating efficiency. Operating income followed a similar trend, decreasing from 1,069,226 in 2022 to 1,270,469 in 2023, and then dropping to 454,231 in 2024. This suggests that while revenue increased in 2023, the subsequent decline in 2024 has severely impacted operating income. Operating expenses have increased slightly from 305,316 in 2022 to 315,327 in 2023, and further to 331,121 in 2024, indicating potential challenges in cost management as revenues decline. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has seen a significant increase from 25.93% in 2022 to 11.23% in 2023, and then to 35.19% in 2024. This fluctuation may indicate changes in tax regulations or one-off tax adjustments that have impacted net profitability. The net profit margin improved from 6.10% in 2022 to 19.40% in 2023, but fell to 10.33% in 2024, reflecting the overall decline in profitability despite previous gains. There are no specific non-recurring items mentioned, but the sharp changes in tax rates and operating income suggest external factors may have influenced profitability, particularly in 2024. |

The effective tax rate rose significantly to 35.19%, which could impact net profitability and cash flow. The reduction in total liabilities to IDR 6.956.641 million suggests improved debt management, but the overall liquidity position remains a concern due to declining current assets.

| Future financial performance projection | Based on the 2024 data, the company faces significant challenges in future financial performance due to declining revenues and profitability. The drop in total assets and current assets suggests potential difficulties in sustaining operations and growth. The improvement in net cash from operations is a positive sign, but the overall financial outlook remains uncertain. The company may need to focus on cost management, operational efficiency, and exploring new revenue streams to stabilize and enhance future performance. | In 2023, the company demonstrated strong revenue growth and profitability, indicating a positive outlook for future financial performance. The solid operating income and net profit margins suggest that the company was well-positioned for growth.
