| Field | Answer |

| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 saw a significant increase from £3,148,754.97 to £3,906,826.40, representing a growth of approximately 24.06%. However, revenue decreased in 2024 to £2,553,285.29, indicating a decline of about 34.61%. Gross margin performance showed a decline from 40.48% in 2022 and 40.59% in 2023 to 30.76% in 2024, suggesting increased direct costs or reduced pricing power. The revenue breakdown by product/service in 2024 indicates a notable drop in 'Perumahan' and 'High rise' compared to 2023, while 'Kawasan industri' and 'Fasilitas' showed some resilience. Geographically, all revenue was generated from Indonesia, with a significant drop from 2023 to 2024, reflecting a challenging market environment. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin trends show a decline from 30.78% in 2022 and 32.52% in 2023 to 17.79% in 2024, indicating a deterioration in operating efficiency.

This suggests that cost management may not have kept pace with revenue declines, leading to reduced profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 0.96% in 2023 to 15.41% in 2024, which could have impacted net profit margins negatively. The income tax expense shifted from a tax benefit in 2022 and 2023 to a tax expense in 2024, indicating a change in profitability and tax obligations. There are no specific non-recurring items mentioned, but the overall decline in revenue and profitability suggests external factors, possibly market conditions or increased competition, affecting the company's financial performance. |
