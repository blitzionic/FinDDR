# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined significantly from IDR 3,906,826 million in 2023 to IDR 2,553,285 million in 2024, a drop of approximately 34.66%. This follows a prior increase of 24.07% from 2022 to 2023. Correspondingly, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) decreased from IDR 2,321,031 million in 2023 to IDR 1,767,933 million in 2024, a 23.83% reduction, but not proportionate to the revenue decline, leading to a gross margin contraction from 40.59% in 2023 to 30.76% in 2024. The gross margin remained stable from 2022 (40.48%) to 2023 but deteriorated sharply in 2024, indicating increased cost pressure or less profitable sales mix. Product/service revenue analysis shows a notable shift: Perumahan revenue decreased from IDR 861,503 million in 2023 to IDR 659,423 million in 2024, and High rise revenue plummeted from IDR 2,027,851 million to IDR 371,760 million, a drastic decline suggesting reduced demand or project completions. Kawasan industri revenue increased from IDR 246,205 million in 2023 to IDR 638,349 million in 2024, indicating a strategic or market shift towards industrial zones. Other segments like Fasilitas and Perkantoran showed moderate increases or stability. Geographically, all revenue is from Indonesia, with a significant revenue contraction in 2024, reflecting possible macroeconomic or sector-specific challenges domestically. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income fell sharply from IDR 1,270,469 million in 2023 to IDR 454,231 million in 2024, a 64.26% decrease, outpacing the revenue decline, which indicates deteriorating operating efficiency. Operating margin dropped from 32.52% in 2023 to 17.79% in 2024, reflecting reduced profitability from core operations. Operating expenses increased slightly from IDR 315,327 million in 2023 to IDR 331,121 million in 2024 despite lower revenue, suggesting less effective cost control or fixed cost burdens. The operating income to revenue relationship weakened, highlighting challenges in managing costs relative to declining sales. The prior year showed improved operating margin from 30.78% in 2022 to 32.52% in 2023, but 2024 reversed this trend significantly, signaling operational inefficiencies or adverse business conditions. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased substantially in magnitude from (11.23%) in 2023 to (35.19%) in 2024, indicating a higher tax benefit or possibly tax credits/refunds impacting net profit positively despite lower pre-tax income. Income tax expense was negative across all years, with a sharp increase in 2024 to -IDR 143,234 million from -IDR 95,867 million in 2023, which may reflect non-recurring tax benefits or adjustments. Net profit margin declined from 19.40% in 2023 to 10.33% in 2024, despite the tax benefit, due to the steep drop in operating income. No explicit non-recurring items are detailed, but the unusual tax expense pattern and large tax benefit in 2024 suggest one-off tax-related impacts. External factors likely include domestic market contraction or sector-specific downturns given the revenue and margin declines, but no direct external event data is provided. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company experienced a decline in total assets to IDR 13,703,553 million from IDR 14,603,908 million in 2023, indicating a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a decrease in current assets from IDR 4,734,770 million to IDR 3,870,567 million. Non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities decreased significantly from IDR 8,064,727 million to IDR 6,956,641 million, reflecting effective liability management and deleveraging efforts. Current liabilities dropped from IDR 4,152,717 million to IDR 3,583,108 million, and non-current liabilities also declined. Shareholders' equity improved slightly to IDR 6,746,912 million from IDR 6,539,181 million, strengthening the equity position despite lower asset levels. Liquidity ratios are unavailable, but the reduction in current assets and liabilities suggests a cautious approach to working capital. Overall, the balance sheet shows a stronger capital structure with reduced leverage and a modestly improved equity base in 2024. | In 2023, the company’s total assets decreased to IDR 14,603,908 million from IDR 16,351,848 million in 2022, indicating a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from IDR 6,459,626 million to IDR 4,734,770 million. Non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities also declined significantly from IDR 10,136,195 million to IDR 8,064,727 million, with current liabilities dropping from IDR 6,191,313 million to IDR 4,152,717 million and non-current liabilities slightly decreasing. Shareholders' equity improved from IDR 6,215,653 million to IDR 6,539,181 million, supported by retained earnings of IDR 1,194,519 million in 2023 (unavailable in 2022). The reduction in liabilities alongside a modest increase in equity suggests improved balance sheet strength and better liability management. Liquidity indicators such as current ratio are unavailable, but the reduction in current assets and current liabilities suggests a tighter liquidity position. Overall, the capital structure shows deleveraging with lower total liabilities and a stronger equity base in 2023 compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company’s revenue in 2024 declined sharply to IDR 2,553,285 million from IDR 3,906,826 million in 2023, a decrease of approximately 34.7%. Correspondingly, gross profit halved to IDR 785,352 million from IDR 1,585,796 million, causing gross margin to fall from 40.59% to 30.76%, indicating margin compression possibly due to higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income dropped significantly to IDR 454,231 million from IDR 1,270,469 million, with operating margin declining from 32.52% to 17.79%, reflecting increased operating expenses and reduced operational profitability. Net profit decreased to IDR 263,852 million from IDR 758,028 million, with net profit margin falling from 19.40% to 10.33%, signaling lower earnings quality and sustainability. The effective tax rate increased substantially in magnitude to 35.19% (negative tax expense), which may have impacted net income. Return on equity and return on assets are unavailable, but the reduced profitability and margins suggest diminished returns in 2024. | The company demonstrated strong profitability growth in 2023. Revenue increased by approximately 24% from IDR 3,148,755 million in 2022 to IDR 3,906,826 million in 2023. Gross profit rose by 24.4% to IDR 1,585,796 million, maintaining a stable gross margin of 40.59%, slightly up from 40.48% in 2022. Operating income increased by 31% to IDR 1,270,469 million, improving the operating margin to 32.52% from 30.78%. Net profit surged nearly fourfold to IDR 758,028 million, with net profit margin expanding significantly to 19.40% from 6.10%, reflecting improved earnings quality and operational leverage. Income before taxes increased substantially, while the effective tax rate decreased from 25.93% to 11.23%, enhancing net profitability. Interest expense slightly decreased, and interest coverage improved markedly to 326.20% from 237.48%, indicating strong earnings sustainability and capacity to service debt. Return on equity and return on assets are unavailable, but the strong net profit growth and equity increase suggest improved returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased slightly to IDR 331,121 million from IDR 315,327 million despite lower revenue, indicating less effective cost control. The operating margin contraction to 17.79% from 32.52% highlights reduced operational efficiency. Asset turnover ratios are unavailable, but the significant revenue decline alongside a modest decrease in total assets suggests lower asset utilization. Net cash from operations improved markedly to a positive IDR 164,288 million from a negative IDR 94,263 million in 2023, indicating better cash generation from core operations despite weaker profitability. Inventories decreased from IDR 3,050,818 million to IDR 2,455,486 million, which may reflect improved inventory management or reduced sales volume. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with improved cash flow but deteriorated margin and cost control. | Operating expenses increased marginally by 3.3% to IDR 315,327 million, which is well controlled relative to the 24% revenue growth, resulting in improved operating margin. Cost of goods sold rose by 23.8%, consistent with revenue growth, maintaining gross margin stability. Cash flow from operations improved significantly, reducing the negative outflow from IDR -443,659 million in 2022 to IDR -94,263 million in 2023, indicating better operational cash generation though still negative. Inventories decreased by 25.7% to IDR 3,050,818 million, suggesting improved inventory management or sales efficiency. Asset turnover and current ratio data are unavailable, limiting detailed asset utilization analysis. Overall, the company improved cost control and operational efficiency, reflected in higher margins and better cash flow from operations despite ongoing negative cash flow. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators such as debt to equity and current ratio are unavailable, but total liabilities decreased by approximately 13.7%, and shareholders' equity increased, suggesting reduced financial risk. Interest expense decreased slightly to IDR 359,417 million from IDR 389,477 million, and interest coverage ratio declined significantly from 326.20% to 126.38%, indicating reduced ability to cover interest expenses from operating income, which could be an early warning sign of increased financial risk. The effective tax rate increased sharply to 35.19% from (11.23%), which may reflect changes in tax policy or profitability structure, potentially impacting net earnings sustainability. The company’s net cash from financing activities remained negative but improved, indicating ongoing debt repayments or reduced financing inflows. Overall, while leverage appears reduced, the lower interest coverage and higher tax burden suggest caution regarding financial risk. | Leverage indicators such as debt to equity and current ratio are unavailable, but total liabilities decreased by 20.5% to IDR 8,064,727 million while equity increased, indicating reduced leverage risk. Interest expense decreased slightly, and interest coverage ratio improved significantly to 326.20%, reflecting enhanced ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate declined substantially, reducing tax burden risk. Negative operating cash flow remains a concern, though it improved markedly. The reduction in current liabilities and current assets may signal tighter liquidity, but no explicit liquidity ratios are provided. Overall, financial risk related to leverage and interest coverage has diminished, but liquidity risk and cash flow sustainability require monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities turned negative in 2024 with net cash from investing at -IDR 85,291 million compared to a positive IDR 411,312 million in 2023, indicating increased capital expenditures or asset purchases that may support future growth. Net cash from financing improved but remained negative at -IDR 281,179 million, suggesting continued debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends increased to approximately IDR 3.13 billion from IDR 2.88 billion, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings. Revenue by product shows a shift with Perumahan and Kawasan industri segments decreasing, while Fasilitas and Perkantoran segments increased, indicating potential strategic focus or market shifts. Geographic revenue remains concentrated in Indonesia but declined overall. The improved operational cash flow and investment in assets suggest potential for recovery, but margin pressures and lower revenue highlight challenges ahead. The company’s ability to sustain dividends and invest in growth will depend on improving profitability and operational efficiency. | Investment activities shifted positively in 2023, with net cash from investing turning positive to IDR 411,312 million from a negative outflow in 2022, indicating possible asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing was negative at IDR -525,225 million, suggesting debt repayments or reduced financing inflows. Despite negative net cash flow from operations, the company maintained dividend payments slightly higher than 2022, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue growth was driven by all major product segments, notably Perumahan and High rise, and geographic revenue remained concentrated in Indonesia with a 24% increase. The introduction of Hotel revenue in 2023 (IDR 17,663 million) and increased 'Lain-lain' revenue suggest diversification. These trends indicate potential for continued growth supported by operational improvements and strategic investment management, though cash flow sustainability and liquidity should be closely managed. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The Company operates primarily as a property developer with a diversified portfolio across four core segments: mixed-use and high-rise buildings, landed residential, industrial estates, and investment properties located mainly in the Greater Jakarta area, Surabaya, and Batang, Central Java.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces economic challenges including political uncertainty related to the 2024 general elections, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations that could impact the investment climate and property regulations. Global economic conditions such as geopolitical tensions, ongoing trade wars (notably between the US and China), and recession risks in several European countries contribute to global market uncertainty affecting Indonesia's economy. Despite Indonesia's positive economic growth of 5.03% in 2024 and projected 5.2% in 2025, external pressures like potential global economic slowdown and energy price volatility remain risks. The property sector experiences sluggish sales in high-rise properties (apartments and offices) and high inventory levels of ready-for-occupancy units, impacting cash flow and sales targets. Consumer purchasing power and preferences are shifting, with declining demand in some segments and longer decision-making processes. The Company also faces risks from exchange rate volatility and potential interest rate increases. Inflation in Indonesia remained controlled at 1.57% in 2024, below the government target, supporting consumer purchasing power. The Company adopts cautious and conservative expansion strategies, focusing on residential and industrial estate segments, leveraging government incentives such as the PPN DTP VAT incentive extended through 2024 to stimulate demand. However, challenges remain in fully recovering all property segments, especially high-rise and office markets, which continue to show low demand and high supply. The Company also manages financial risks including credit risk from customers, liquidity risk, and capital risk, maintaining prudent financial policies and restructuring debt to ensure financial stability amid economic uncertainties. | The Company faces several economic challenges and uncertainties impacting revenue and profitability. Globally, economic deceleration and geopolitical tensions, including wars in Europe and Western Asia, have slowed growth and created volatility. Domestically, political uncertainty surrounding the 2024 General Elections affects investment climate and consumer confidence, leading to postponed property purchases. Inflation is expected to remain controlled around 2.5%, supporting stable property prices, but interest rates and bond yields remain high in developed countries, influencing domestic borrowing costs. The property market shows mixed conditions: strong demand in landed houses and industrial estates, especially in lower-middle price segments, but stagnation in high-rise residential properties like apartments due to cautious consumer behavior and prolonged decision-making. The Company mitigates risks by focusing on cost efficiency, postponing new high-rise launches, leveraging government incentives such as the 100% VAT exemption (PPN DTP), and emphasizing sales of ready inventory. Financial risks include exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating-rate borrowings and credit risks from customer payment constraints, particularly in landed units. The Company also faces risks from changes in tax regulations and foreign currency exposure, though the latter is limited. Overall, economic uncertainties from global slowdown, domestic political dynamics, and market conditions require careful risk management and strategic adjustments to sustain growth. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Company faces competitive pressures from high competition among property developers targeting similar locations and market segments, particularly in high-rise, residential, industrial estate, and investment property development. Strategic risks arise from inappropriate planning and implementation amid this competitive landscape. The high-rise property segment, especially apartments and office buildings, continues to experience weak demand and slow recovery, with end-users being the primary buyers and slow decision-making processes. The Company competes by adopting adaptive strategies including organic growth, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, and capital and investment management to strengthen market position. It leverages joint ventures and collaborations with strategic partners to access resources and mitigate risks. Marketing strategies are differentiated by segment and project, focusing on competitive pricing, product value, and digital marketing innovations such as virtual tours and flexible payment schemes. The Company also emphasizes customer relationship management and market education to build loyalty and trust. Despite these efforts, the property market remains dynamic and challenging, requiring continuous innovation and cautious expansion to maintain competitiveness and business sustainability. | The Company encounters competitive pressures from both established players and market dynamics that challenge its market position. The stagnation in the high-rise residential segment, dominated by end-users with limited investor interest, reflects cautious consumer sentiment amid economic and policy uncertainties. Competitors are shifting focus toward the lower middle-class market segment, which remains robust, indicating evolving market competition and consumer preferences. The Company responds by intensifying marketing efforts, focusing on residential and industrial sectors, and refraining from launching new high-rise projects in unfavorable market conditions. Strategic cooperation with landowners, investors, and capital owners is pursued to expand resources and optimize project value, mitigating competitive threats. Technological innovation and continuous improvement programs foster operational efficiency and customer engagement, supporting competitiveness. The Company also leverages digital marketing to enhance consumer reach. Despite challenges, the Company’s extensive experience, diversified portfolio, and commitment to innovation and good corporate governance underpin its ability to navigate industry dynamics and maintain a competitive edge. |
