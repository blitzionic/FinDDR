# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined significantly from IDR 3,906,826 million in 2023 to IDR 2,553,285 million in 2024, a decrease of approximately 34.66%. This follows a prior increase of 24.07% from 2022 to 2023. Correspondingly, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) decreased from IDR 2,321,031 million in 2023 to IDR 1,767,933 million in 2024, a 23.83% reduction, but less steep than revenue decline, causing gross profit to drop sharply by 50.5% from IDR 1,585,796 million in 2023 to IDR 785,352 million in 2024. Gross margin contracted from 40.59% in 2023 to 30.76% in 2024, indicating reduced profitability on sales. Examining revenue by product/service, Perumahan revenue fell from IDR 861,503 million in 2023 to IDR 659,423 million in 2024 (-23.45%), High Rise plummeted from IDR 2,027,851 million to IDR 371,760 million (-81.67%), while Kawasan Industri increased substantially from IDR 246,205 million to IDR 638,349 million (+159.3%). Fasilitas and Perkantoran revenues increased moderately by 12.5% and 13.3% respectively, while Hotel revenue more than doubled from IDR 17,664 million to IDR 39,452 million. The 'Lain-lain' category remained negligible. Geographically, all revenue is from Indonesia, with a notable revenue contraction of 34.66% in 2024 after growth in 2023, indicating no geographic diversification or shift. Overall, the company experienced a sharp revenue decline in 2024 driven mainly by a collapse in High Rise segment sales, partially offset by growth in Kawasan Industri and other segments, but gross margin compression suggests cost pressures or pricing challenges. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income declined sharply from IDR 1,270,469 million in 2023 to IDR 454,231 million in 2024 (-64.26%), reflecting the revenue drop and margin compression. Operating margin fell from 32.52% in 2023 to 17.79% in 2024, indicating a significant deterioration in operational profitability. Despite operating expenses increasing slightly from IDR 315,327 million in 2023 to IDR 331,121 million in 2024 (+4.93%), the company failed to reduce costs in line with revenue decline, hurting operating leverage. The operating income to revenue ratio halved, showing inefficiency in cost management relative to shrinking sales. The relatively stable operating expenses amid a 34.66% revenue drop suggest fixed costs or inefficiencies that were not adjusted downward, negatively impacting operating margins. Overall, the company’s operating efficiency deteriorated in 2024 due to steep revenue decline, insufficient cost control, and margin compression. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased dramatically from 11.21% in 2023 to 35.19% in 2024, significantly impacting net profitability. In 2022, the effective tax rate was negative (-25.93%), indicating tax benefits or credits that year. The sharp rise in tax expense in 2024 (IDR 143,234 million) compared to 2023 (IDR 95,688 million) despite lower pre-tax income suggests a heavier tax burden or reduced tax shields. No explicit non-recurring items are reported, but the unusual tax rate swings and net profit stability despite revenue and operating income collapse imply external tax or regulatory factors affecting profitability. Net profit margin improved to 6.84% in 2024 from 4.46% in 2023, driven by tax and possibly other non-operating factors, despite operating margin deterioration. External factors such as tax policy changes or one-off tax adjustments likely influenced the effective tax rate and net profit outcomes in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company’s total assets decreased to IDR 13,703,553 million from IDR 14,603,908 million in 2023, indicating a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from IDR 4,734,770 million to IDR 3,870,567 million, while non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities also declined significantly from IDR 8,064,726 million to IDR 6,956,641 million, reflecting effective liability management and deleveraging. Shareholders' equity improved slightly to IDR 6,746,912 million from IDR 6,539,181 million, supported by increased retained earnings (IDR 1,372,530 million vs. IDR 1,194,519 million). Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, decreased marginally from 114.02% to 108.02%, still indicating adequate short-term financial strength. The debt to equity ratio improved from 123.33% to 103.11%, showing a healthier capital structure with reduced reliance on debt financing. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a stronger equity position and reduced leverage, though asset contraction and slightly lower liquidity warrant monitoring. | In 2023, the company’s total assets decreased to IDR 14,603,908 million from IDR 16,351,848 million in 2022, indicating a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from IDR 6,459,626 million to IDR 4,734,770 million. Non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities declined significantly from IDR 10,136,195 million to IDR 8,064,726 million, reflecting effective liability management and deleveraging. Current liabilities dropped from IDR 6,191,313 million to IDR 4,152,717 million, improving short-term financial stability. Shareholders' equity increased modestly from IDR 6,215,653 million to IDR 6,539,181 million, supported by higher retained earnings (IDR 1,194,519 million vs. IDR 1,022,160 million). Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio rising from 104.33% to 114.02%, and the debt to equity ratio decreased from 163.08% to 123.33%, indicating a stronger capital structure and reduced financial risk exposure. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue in 2024 declined sharply to IDR 2,553,285 million from IDR 3,906,826 million in 2023, a decrease of approximately 34.7%. Correspondingly, gross profit halved to IDR 785,352 million from IDR 1,585,796 million, with gross margin compressing from 40.59% to 30.76%, indicating increased cost pressure or pricing challenges. Operating income dropped more than 64% to IDR 454,231 million, with operating margin falling from 32.52% to 17.79%, reflecting less efficient cost control or higher operating expenses relative to revenue. Despite these declines, net profit slightly increased to IDR 174,766 million from IDR 174,108 million, improving net profit margin from 4.46% to 6.84%, suggesting improved bottom-line efficiency or non-operating income effects. Return on equity slightly decreased from 2.73% to 2.63%, while return on assets improved from 1.12% to 1.23%, indicating modestly better asset profitability but stable shareholder returns. The effective tax rate rose sharply from 11.21% to 35.19%, which may impact future earnings sustainability. Overall, profitability weakened at the top line and operating level but net earnings held steady with improved margins, though tax burden and margin compression are concerns. | Revenue grew substantially by approximately 24% from IDR 3,148,755 million in 2022 to IDR 3,906,826 million in 2023, driven by increases across key segments such as Perumahan and High Rise. Gross profit increased by 24.4% to IDR 1,585,796 million, maintaining a stable gross margin of 40.59%, slightly up from 40.48%. Operating income rose by 31% to IDR 1,270,469 million, improving the operating margin to 32.52% from 30.78%, reflecting effective cost control relative to revenue growth. However, net profit declined by 9.3% to IDR 174,108 million, causing net profit margin to fall to 4.46% from 6.10%, largely due to higher interest expenses and income tax expense shifting from a tax benefit in 2022 to a tax charge in 2023. Return on equity and assets were modest at 2.73% and 1.12% respectively, indicating low earnings sustainability despite revenue and operating profit growth. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased slightly from IDR 315,327 million to IDR 331,121 million despite lower revenue, contributing to a reduced operating margin of 17.79% from 32.52%. Asset turnover declined from 25.24% to 18.04%, indicating less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Inventories decreased from IDR 3,050,818 million to IDR 2,455,486 million, which may reflect better inventory management or reduced sales volume. Net cash from operations improved significantly from a negative IDR 94,263 million to a positive IDR 164,288 million, demonstrating enhanced cash generation capability and operational cash flow health. Working capital, inferred from current assets and liabilities, decreased but current ratio remains above 1, indicating manageable short-term obligations. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: cost control challenges and lower asset utilization contrast with improved cash flow from operations and inventory management. | The company demonstrated improved operational efficiency in 2023 with an increased operating margin of 32.52%, up from 30.78% in 2022, indicating better cost control relative to revenue. Operating expenses increased marginally by about 3.3%, which is well below the revenue growth rate, supporting margin expansion. Asset turnover was reported at 25.24%, suggesting efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue. Despite these positive trends, net cash from operations remained negative at IDR -94,263 million, though this was a significant improvement from the prior year’s negative IDR -443,659 million, indicating progress towards cash flow stabilization. Inventories decreased from IDR 4,106,860 million to IDR 3,050,818 million, which may reflect better inventory management or sales efficiency. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators improved with debt to equity ratio declining from 123.33% to 103.11%, reducing financial risk. Interest expense decreased slightly from IDR 389,477 million to IDR 359,417 million, but interest coverage ratio dropped significantly from 326.20% to 126.38%, indicating reduced ability to cover interest from operating income and a potential early warning sign. The effective tax rate increased markedly from 11.21% to 35.19%, which could pressure net profitability and cash flows. Liquidity remains adequate with a current ratio of 108.02%, though lower than prior year. The decline in asset turnover and operating margins may also signal operational risks. Overall, while leverage and liquidity improved, the sharp decline in interest coverage and higher tax rate suggest emerging financial risks that require close monitoring. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023. The debt to equity ratio decreased substantially to 123.33% from 163.08%, reducing leverage risk. Interest expense slightly decreased to IDR 389,477 million from IDR 408,134 million, while interest coverage ratio improved markedly to 326.20% from 237.48%, indicating enhanced ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate shifted from a negative 25.93% in 2022 (tax benefit) to a positive 11.21% in 2023, which may impact net profitability. Liquidity improved as the current ratio increased to 114.02%, reflecting better short-term asset coverage of liabilities. However, the continued negative net cash from operations signals ongoing operational cash flow risk that requires monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities turned negative in 2024 with net cash from investing at -IDR 85,291 million compared to a positive IDR 411,312 million in 2023, indicating increased capital expenditures or asset purchases that may support future growth. Net cash from financing improved to -IDR 281,179 million from -IDR 525,225 million, suggesting reduced debt repayments or financing outflows. Despite positive operational cash flow, the net decrease in cash remained negative at -IDR 201,988 million, similar to the prior year, which may constrain liquidity. Dividends increased substantially to IDR 3,134,935,791 from IDR 2,880,491,551, reflecting a shareholder-friendly policy despite earnings pressure. Revenue by product shows a shift with significant declines in High Rise segment revenue (from Rp2,027,851 million to Rp371,760 million) but growth in Kawasan Industri and Hotel segments, indicating possible strategic realignment or market shifts. Geographic revenue remains concentrated in Indonesia but declined overall. These trends suggest cautious optimism for future performance driven by selective investment and segment diversification, though cash flow sustainability and market conditions require vigilance. | Investment activities showed a positive net cash inflow from investing of IDR 411,312 million in 2023, reversing the prior year’s outflow, suggesting divestments or returns on investments that may support future growth. Financing cash flow was negative at IDR -525,225 million, indicating debt repayments or reduced external financing, consistent with deleveraging trends. Despite negative operational cash flow, the reduction in its magnitude suggests improving cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments increased slightly to IDR 2,880,491,551, indicating a stable or growing dividend policy. Revenue growth was driven by key segments such as Perumahan and High Rise, and all revenue was generated domestically in Indonesia, highlighting geographic concentration but also potential for focused market growth. Overall, the company appears positioned for moderate growth with improving financial stability but must address operational cash flow challenges to sustain future performance. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The Company operates primarily as a property developer with a diversified portfolio across four core segments: mixed-use and high-rise buildings, landed residential, industrial estates, and investment properties located mainly in the Greater Jakarta area, Surabaya, and Batang, Central Java.

The business model combines development income from property sales and recurring income from property management and leasing. The Company employs strategies such as organic growth focusing on optimizing asset value and land bank reserves, acquisitions of new land and established property companies, and strategic cooperation with landowners, investors, and capital owners to expand market share and enhance competitiveness. Marketing strategies are tailored per segment, emphasizing ready-to-occupy units and leveraging government incentives like the VAT exemption (PPN DTP) to stimulate demand, especially in the residential segment targeting end-users and first-time homebuyers. The Company also invests in digital marketing and customer relationship management to strengthen sales and customer loyalty. | The company operates primarily as a property developer with a diversified portfolio divided into four core segments: mixed-use and high-rise buildings, residential estates, industrial estates, and investment properties. It generates revenue mainly through the sales of real estate inventories, which accounted for approximately 80% of total revenues in 2023, including sales of apartments, houses, land, and industrial estate land.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces economic challenges including political uncertainty related to the 2024 general elections, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations that could impact the investment climate and property regulations. Global economic growth is moderate at 2.7%, restrained by contractions and conflicts in the US, China, and Europe, with recession risks in several European countries. These global tensions contribute to market uncertainty and affect investor and consumer confidence, leading to delayed purchases and investments. Domestically, although Indonesia's economy grew by 5.03% in 2024 and is projected to grow 5.2% in 2025 with controlled inflation around 1.57%, challenges remain such as potential interest rate increases, exchange rate volatility, and global political dynamics that may influence market sentiment. The property sector shows uneven recovery; while residential and industrial estate segments grow positively, high-rise properties like apartments and offices face sluggish sales and high inventory levels, pressuring cash flow and profitability. The Company also contends with changing consumer preferences and declining purchasing power amid these economic conditions. Cost pressures include increased selling expenses and commission costs. The Company mitigates these risks through cautious expansion, adaptive pricing strategies, promotional marketing, and close monitoring of economic and regulatory developments. | The Company faces several economic challenges and uncertainties impacting revenue and profitability. Globally, economic growth has been slowing, with the World Bank reporting a decline to 2.6% in 2023 and a projected further slowdown to 2.4% in 2024, influenced by geopolitical tensions and risks of recession in advanced economies. Domestically, Indonesia's economy grew by 5.05% in 2023, slightly below projections, with inflation well managed at 2.61%. However, the property market remains challenged by low consumer interest and investment, especially in high-rise residential segments such as apartments, which experienced stagnation and prolonged decision-making by buyers. Political uncertainty related to the 2024 general elections has dampened investment and caused consumers to postpone property purchases. The Company also faces risks from potential increases in domestic interest rates influenced by international economic policies, inflation, and bond yields. Cost pressures and the need for efficient capital and investment management are ongoing concerns, with the Company adopting cautious financing policies, including postponing new high-rise project launches and focusing on lower-risk housing and industrial estate developments. Government incentives like the VAT exemption (PPN DTP) have helped stimulate demand, but overall market conditions remain volatile and uncertain, requiring continuous monitoring and strategic adjustments. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Company operates in a highly competitive property market with intense rivalry among developers targeting similar locations and market segments. Strategic risks arise from inappropriate planning and execution amid this competition. The high-rise property segment, including apartments and office buildings, faces significant challenges with low demand and slow decision-making by buyers, partly due to cautious investor sentiment post-election. The Company addresses competitive pressures by focusing on organic growth, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, and capital management to strengthen market position. It employs differentiated marketing strategies tailored to each segment, emphasizing products with competitive value, especially in the landed residential segment. Digital marketing, innovative financing schemes, and bundling with banks are used to attract buyers. The Company also leverages government incentives like the PPN DTP VAT program to enhance competitiveness. Strategic cooperation with landowners, investors, and capital providers helps optimize project value and manage risks. Despite market challenges, the Company aims to maintain its competitiveness through continuous innovation, adaptive strategies, and leveraging its diversified portfolio and experience. | The Company encounters competitive pressures from both established players and market dynamics that challenge its market position. The stagnation in the high-rise residential market, dominated by end-users with limited investor interest, reflects cautious consumer behavior amid economic and policy uncertainties. Competitors have shifted focus toward the lower middle-class housing segment, which remains robust, indicating a need for strategic adaptation. The Company has responded by intensifying marketing efforts on ready-to-move-in units and prioritizing sales of existing inventory, especially in residential and industrial estate segments, while refraining from launching new high-rise projects due to unfavorable market conditions. The industrial area development segment shows promising growth driven by foreign investments, prompting the Company to seek strategic collaborations to develop integrated industrial facilities. Technological innovation and continuous improvement programs are emphasized to maintain competitiveness. The Company also leverages strategic cooperation with landowners, investors, and capital owners to expand resources and optimize project value. Despite these efforts, the property sector's dynamic and challenging landscape, including excess office space supply and slow absorption rates, requires the Company to remain agile and innovative to sustain its market position. |
