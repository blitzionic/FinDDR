# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Intiland Development Tbk's revenue declined significantly from IDR 3,906,826 million in 2023 to IDR 2,553,285 million in 2024, following a rise from IDR 3,148,755 million in 2022 to 2023.

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Intiland Development Tbk's total assets decreased to IDR 13,703,553 million from IDR 14,603,908 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from IDR 4,734,770 million to IDR 3,870,567 million, while non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities also declined significantly from IDR 8,064,727 million to IDR 6,956,641 million, with both current liabilities and non-current liabilities decreasing, indicating a reduction in the company's obligations. Shareholders' equity increased slightly to IDR 6,746,912 million from IDR 6,539,181 million, supported by higher retained earnings (IDR 1,372,530 million vs. IDR 1,194,519 million). The current ratio decreased marginally to 108.02% from 114.77%, suggesting a slight weakening in short-term liquidity but still above 100%, indicating the company can cover its current liabilities with current assets. The debt to equity ratio improved to 103.11% from 123.33%, showing a healthier capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company maintained a solid equity base with reduced liabilities and adequate liquidity, though asset contraction and lower current assets warrant monitoring. | In 2023, PT Intiland Development Tbk's total assets decreased to IDR 14,603,908 million from IDR 16,351,848 million in 2022, indicating a contraction in asset base. Current assets also declined from IDR 6,459,626 million to IDR 4,734,770 million, while non-current assets remained relatively stable. Total liabilities reduced significantly from IDR 10,136,195 million to IDR 8,064,727 million, driven by a notable decrease in current liabilities from IDR 6,191,313 million to IDR 4,125,386 million, with non-current liabilities nearly unchanged. Shareholders' equity increased moderately from IDR 6,215,653 million to IDR 6,539,181 million, supported by higher retained earnings. The current ratio improved from 104.33% to 114.77%, reflecting enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved substantially from 163.08% to 123.33%, indicating a stronger capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company shows improved financial health in 2023 with lower liabilities, stronger equity, and better liquidity despite a smaller asset base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company experienced a notable decline in profitability in 2024 compared to 2023. Revenue dropped sharply by approximately 34.6% from IDR 3,906,826 million to IDR 2,553,285 million. Correspondingly, gross profit halved from IDR 1,585,796 million to IDR 785,352 million, causing the gross margin to fall from 40.59% to 30.76%. Operating income declined by about 64% to IDR 454,231 million, with operating margin contracting from 32.52% to 17.79%. Net profit also decreased significantly by approximately 65% to IDR 263,852 million, resulting in a net profit margin reduction from 19.40% to 10.33%. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) weakened substantially to 3.97% and 1.86%, respectively, from 11.89% and 4.90% in 2023, indicating diminished earnings quality and lower efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased negatively to -35.19% from -11.23%, reflecting higher tax expenses relative to income before taxes. Overall, profitability and earnings quality deteriorated markedly in 2024, signaling challenges in revenue generation and cost absorption. | Revenue increased by approximately 24% from IDR 3,148,755 million in 2022 to IDR 3,906,826 million in 2023, reflecting strong top-line growth. Gross profit rose from IDR 1,274,542 million to IDR 1,585,796 million, maintaining a stable gross margin around 40.59%, slightly up from 40.48%. Operating income increased significantly by about 31% to IDR 1,270,469 million, improving the operating margin to 32.52% from 30.78%. Income before taxes more than tripled to IDR 853,895 million from IDR 259,162 million. Net profit was IDR 758,028 million in 2023, a substantial improvement from the anomalous 2022 figure (IDR 191,968,000,000 appears inconsistent and likely erroneous), with net profit margin at 19.40%. Return on equity and assets were reported at 11.89% and 4.90%, respectively, indicating reasonable profitability and efficient asset use. The effective tax rate decreased to -11.23% from -25.93%, suggesting a lower tax burden or tax benefits. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved markedly in 2023 with higher revenues, margins, and returns. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency declined in 2024 as evidenced by several metrics. Cost of goods sold decreased in absolute terms but remained a high proportion of revenue, contributing to a lower gross margin. Operating expenses slightly increased from IDR 315,327 million to IDR 331,121 million despite lower revenue, indicating less effective cost control. Asset turnover dropped from 25.24% to 18.04%, showing reduced efficiency in utilizing assets to generate sales. Inventories decreased from IDR 3,050,818 million to IDR 2,455,486 million, which may reflect lower sales or inventory management adjustments. Net cash from operations improved dramatically from a negative IDR 94,262 million to a positive IDR 164,288 million, indicating better cash generation from core business activities despite lower profitability. Working capital, inferred from current assets and liabilities, decreased but remained positive, supporting operational liquidity. However, net cash from investing activities turned negative to IDR -85,291 million from a large positive inflow in 2023, suggesting increased investment outflows. Overall, while cash flow from operations improved, operational efficiency in cost control and asset utilization weakened in 2024. | Cost of goods sold increased in line with revenue, from IDR 1,874,213 million to IDR 2,321,031 million, maintaining gross margin stability. Operating expenses rose slightly by about 3% to IDR 315,327 million, indicating effective cost control relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover was high at 25.24, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations was negative and worsened significantly to IDR (94,262,514,125), indicating operational cash flow challenges despite profitability. Inventories decreased from IDR 4,106,860 million to IDR 3,050,818 million, which may reflect better inventory management or lower stock levels. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supported by a higher current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: good cost control and asset utilization but strained operational cash flow. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show mixed signals in 2024. Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio improved to 103.11% from 123.33%, reducing financial risk related to excessive borrowing. The current ratio remained above 100% at 108.02%, indicating adequate short-term liquidity, though slightly lower than the prior year. Interest expense decreased marginally to IDR 359,417 million from IDR 389,477 million, but interest coverage ratio worsened significantly from -326.20% to -126.38%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest expenses from operating income, which is a concern. The effective tax rate increased negatively to -35.19% from -11.23%, indicating higher tax burden relative to pre-tax income, which could impact net profitability. The substantial decline in profitability and margins, combined with lower interest coverage, suggests increased vulnerability to earnings volatility and financial stress. No dividend payments were reported in 2024, which may reflect a conservative approach to preserve cash amid these risks. Overall, while leverage and liquidity improved, profitability and interest coverage deterioration raise early warning flags on financial risk. | Leverage risk decreased as debt to equity ratio improved from 163.08% to 123.33%, reducing financial risk. Liquidity risk also declined with the current ratio rising to 114.77%, indicating better ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense decreased slightly to IDR (389,477) million, and interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 326.20%, suggesting strong earnings relative to interest costs and low risk of default. The effective tax rate moved closer to zero at -11.23%, which may indicate tax planning or credits but also warrants monitoring for sustainability. Negative net cash from operations and large negative net cash from financing (IDR (525,224,908,935)) highlight potential liquidity and financing risks. No dividends were paid, possibly conserving cash. Overall, financial risk has moderated with improved leverage and coverage, but cash flow and financing outflows pose cautionary signals. |
| Future financial performance projection | The 2024 financial data suggest cautious future performance outlook. The company invested heavily in 2024 as indicated by negative net cash from investing activities of IDR -85,291 million compared to a large positive inflow in 2023, signaling active capital expenditure or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from operations turned positive and strong at IDR 164,288 million, indicating improved cash flow sustainability despite lower earnings, which is a positive sign for funding ongoing investments. Financing cash outflows decreased to IDR -281,179 million from a larger outflow in 2023, possibly reflecting reduced debt repayments or financing activities. No dividends were declared in 2024, suggesting a focus on reinvestment and balance sheet strengthening rather than shareholder payouts. Revenue by product segments shows a shift with decreased development income and mixed-use & high-rise revenues but increased industrial estate and recurring income segments, indicating potential diversification and geographic expansion opportunities. However, the absence of geographic revenue data for 2024 limits regional performance insights. Overall, the company appears to be prioritizing investment and cash flow management to support future growth, but profitability challenges and margin pressures may constrain near-term financial performance. | The company showed significant investing cash inflows of IDR 411,311,746,875 in 2023, indicating active investment or asset disposals that could support future growth. However, net cash from financing was heavily negative at IDR (525,224,908,935), suggesting debt repayments or capital restructuring. The absence of dividends indicates a conservative dividend policy, likely prioritizing reinvestment or debt reduction. Revenue by product shows strong development income (IDR 3,135,559,389,326) and growth in mixed-use & high-rise segments, signaling focus on core real estate development. Geographic revenue declined slightly in Jakarta and Surabaya, which may require strategic attention. The combination of investment activity, improved profitability, and cautious financing suggests the company is positioning for sustainable future performance but must manage cash flow carefully to maintain liquidity and support growth. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | PT Intiland Development Tbk faces several economic challenges and uncertainties in 2024 and looking forward to 2025. Key economic challenges include the impact of global economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions, ongoing trade wars (notably between the US and China), and recession risks in several European countries, which contribute to global market uncertainty. Domestically, although Indonesia's economy showed positive growth of 5.03% in 2024 and is projected to grow 5.2% in 2025, the Company remains cautious due to inflation, interest rate fluctuations, and political uncertainty related to the 2024 general elections that affected consumer and investor confidence, causing delays in purchases and investments. Inflation was controlled at 1.57% in 2024, below the government target, supporting consumer purchasing power. However, sluggish sales performance in the high-rise property segment (apartments and offices) and high inventory of ready-for-occupancy units pose challenges to cash flow and sales targets. The Company also faces cost pressures from interest expenses and financial risks including credit risk from customers, liquidity risk, and capital risk. Potential rising interest rates, exchange rate volatility, and global political dynamics remain key risks that could impact market sentiment and profitability. The Company adopts a conservative approach in project expansion and carefully manages financial and operational risks amid these economic uncertainties. | PT Intiland Development Tbk faces several economic challenges and uncertainties as outlined in the 2023 annual report. Globally, the economy is experiencing a deceleration with growth slowing to 2.6% in 2023 and projected to further slow to 2.4% in 2024, influenced by geopolitical tensions and risks of recession in developed countries. Domestically, Indonesia's economy grew by 5.05% in 2023, slightly below projections, with inflation well managed at 2.61%. However, the company anticipates continued global economic uncertainty, including geopolitical tensions, economic weaknesses in countries like China, and high interest rates and bond yields in developed countries, which could impact domestic interest rates. The political climate surrounding the 2024 general elections introduces uncertainty affecting investment climate and consumer confidence, leading to postponed property purchases. Inflation control and stable economic growth are critical to maintaining consumer purchasing power and investment confidence. The property market faces low buying interest and shifting consumer behavior, with prolonged decision-making processes especially in the middle to upper residential market and high-rise segments. Cost pressures and financial risks include credit risk from payment constraints, interest rate risks from floating rate borrowings, and the need for careful financing policies to avoid excessive bank debt. The company mitigates these risks through efficient cost management, debt restructuring, and leveraging government incentives such as the VAT exemption policy (PPN DTP) to stimulate demand. Overall, economic challenges include macroeconomic volatility, political uncertainty, cost and financing pressures, and evolving consumer preferences impacting revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Company faces significant competitive pressures from both established players and market dynamics in the property sector. The high-rise property segment, including apartments and office buildings, remains weak with low absorption rates and slow decision-making by buyers, despite government policies such as flexibility in property ownership by foreign nationals. Market competition is intense, especially among developers targeting similar locations and market segments. The Company addresses these pressures through strategic planning, joint ventures, innovation, and adaptive marketing strategies including digital marketing, virtual tours, flexible payment schemes, and bundling with banks to attract buyers.

Strategic cooperation with landowners, investors, and capital owners is pursued to enhance project scale and complexity. The Company continuously monitors market trends, consumer preferences, and economic conditions to adjust its portfolio and strategies to remain competitive. Despite challenges, the Company leverages its diversified portfolio, experience, and resources to sustain its market position and pursue growth opportunities. | The company faces competitive pressures from both established players and market dynamics that challenge its market position. The high-rise residential segment, particularly apartments and office units, remains stagnant with limited investor demand and cautious end-users, leading the company to postpone launching new projects in this segment. There is a notable shift in market focus by some developers towards the lower middle-class residential segment, which remains robust, indicating changing competitive dynamics. The industrial estate segment shows promising growth driven by foreign investments from China, Taiwan, and Korea, prompting the company to pursue strategic collaborations and partnerships to develop integrated industrial facilities. The company actively monitors market trends and consumer preferences to adjust its portfolio and strategies, emphasizing innovation and strategic cooperation to optimize project value and risk management. Competitive threats also arise from prolonged consumer decision-making and economic uncertainties that affect market demand.

These product launches and innovations emphasize Intiland's strategy to cater to market demand with differentiated residential and commercial offerings, leveraging strategic locations and integrated amenities to enhance market differentiation. |
