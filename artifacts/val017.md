| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue showed a steady growth from IDR 64.7975 trillion in 2022 to IDR 67.9099 trillion in 2023, and further to IDR 72.5972 trillion in 2024, representing a CAGR of approximately 6.1% over the two years. Gross profit increased from IDR 21.7923 trillion in 2022 to IDR 25.1263 trillion in 2023 and to IDR 26.8931 trillion in 2024, indicating improving profitability at the gross level.

The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that the company is generating higher operating profits per unit of revenue over time, signaling operational leverage and efficiency gains. |
| External & One-Off Impact | Income tax expense decreased from IDR 2.97957 trillion in 2023 to IDR 2.68596 trillion in 2024, despite higher operating income, suggesting a lower effective tax burden or tax planning benefits. Net profit increased modestly from IDR 6.9906 trillion in 2023 to IDR 7.0794 trillion in 2024, but net profit margin slightly declined from 10.29% to 9.75%, possibly due to tax or other non-operating factors.

Foreign currency risk arises from borrowings, export sales, and key purchases denominated or influenced by US Dollar movements; no formal hedging policy exists. A 10% fluctuation in Rupiah exchange rate could significantly affect income before tax due to revaluation of financial assets and liabilities. Credit risk comes from customer credit and bank deposits; mitigated by policies ensuring sales to creditworthy customers and placing funds in reputable banks with investment limits to minimize concentration risk. Liquidity risk involves meeting contractual obligations; managed by maintaining sufficient cash and committed credit facilities, regular cash flow evaluation, and pursuing funding initiatives including bank loans and equity issuance. Commodity price risk affects costs of key raw materials like wheat flour, cooking oil, and skim milk powder; mitigated by inventory optimization and periodic product price adjustments. | Financial risks include exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity, and capital structure. The Company manages liquidity with strong cash and cash equivalents (Rp19.35 trillion as of December 2023) and maintains healthy capital ratios, adjusting capital structure as needed in response to economic conditions. The Company’s debt ratios improved in 2023, with gross debt to equity at 0.70 times and net debt to equity at 0.39 times, indicating sound solvency. Other financial risks include unrealized losses on financial assets and exchange losses impacting comprehensive income. The Company adopts prudent financial management and cost-saving programs to mitigate financial risks. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks include adherence to regulatory requirements in environmental management, labor, health and safety, food safety, and halal certification.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces significant economic challenges stemming from ongoing geopolitical conflicts that threaten global economic stability. Disruptions in major shipping routes may cause surges in energy prices and hamper commodity supplies, leading to higher energy and raw material costs, increased inflation rates, fluctuations in the rupiah-US dollar exchange rate, and a slowdown in economic growth. Inflation, although easing to 1.57% in 2024, continues to pressure the purchasing power of lower-income consumers. The rupiah weakened by approximately 4% against the US dollar in 2024 and further to above Rp16,000 in early 2025, partly due to uncertainties surrounding US tariff policies. Commodity and raw material price volatility, influenced by demand-supply dynamics, weather conditions, consumption trends, local regulations, economic conditions, exchange rates, and geopolitical events, also pose cost pressures. The macroeconomic outlook for 2025 anticipates continued resilience with around 5% GDP growth in Indonesia and manageable inflation near 3%, but risks persist from geopolitical tensions, China's economic slowdown, protectionism, and tariffs. The purchasing power of middle-lower income segments is expected to remain impacted by rising prices. The Company plans to mitigate these challenges through cost-saving programs, prudent expenditure, supply chain strengthening, diversification of raw material sources, and operational efficiency improvements including automation and energy management. | The Company faces economic challenges stemming from global geopolitical conflicts that threaten post-pandemic economic recovery, causing disruptions in shipping routes, surges in energy prices, and commodity supply constraints. These factors lead to higher energy and raw material costs, increased inflation, exchange rate fluctuations (rupiah-US dollar), and slower economic growth. Inflationary pressures have impacted the purchasing power of lower-income consumers, influencing consumption patterns such as preference for smaller packaging or more affordable brands. The Company manages these risks through close monitoring of economic conditions, cost-saving programs, prudent expenditure, supply chain diversification, and regular commodity price simulations. The Indonesian economy showed resilience with GDP growth of 5.05% in 2023 and inflation normalized to 2.61%, but prices remain high affecting lower-income segments. Looking ahead to 2024, inflation is expected to remain manageable around 3%, with stable rupiah exchange rates, though global macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions continue to pose downside risks. The Company anticipates ongoing challenges from weaker purchasing power and volatile commodity prices, especially in the non-alcoholic beverage industry, and plans to focus on operational scale expansion, distribution penetration, innovation, and efficiency improvements to sustain growth and profitability. |
