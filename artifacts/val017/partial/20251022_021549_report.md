# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue increased from IDR 64,797,500 million in 2022 to IDR 72,597,188 million in 2024, representing a compound growth of approximately 5.5% from 2022 to 2023 and 6.9% from 2023 to 2024. Gross profit rose from IDR 21,792,300 million in 2022 to IDR 26,893,100 million in 2024, with gross margin stabilizing around 37% in 2023 and 2024 after an anomalously high 166.37% in 2022, likely due to data irregularities in 2022 cost of goods sold. Revenue by product shows the Noodles Division as the dominant contributor, growing from IDR 50.44 trillion in 2023 to IDR 53.87 trillion in 2024, a 6.8% increase. Other divisions such as Dairy, Snack Foods, Food Seasonings, Nutrition & Special Foods, and Beverages also showed steady growth ranging from 4.3% to 11.5%. Geographically, Indonesia remains the largest market, increasing revenue from IDR 47.62 trillion in 2023 to IDR 50.03 trillion in 2024 (5.1% growth). The Middle East and Africa region also expanded by 7.4%, from IDR 16.16 trillion to IDR 17.36 trillion, indicating successful regional expansion. Other Asia and Others segments grew by 32% and 22.8% respectively, showing diversification in geographic revenue streams. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from IDR 13,377,600 million in 2022 to IDR 16,321,200 million in 2024, reflecting a steady improvement in operating margin from 20.65% in 2022 to 22.48% in 2024. This indicates enhanced operational efficiency and better cost control relative to revenue growth. Operating expenses appear inconsistent in 2022 due to negative values, but from 2023 to 2024, operating expenses increased moderately from IDR 3,341,473 million to IDR 3,701,909 million (10.7%), which is controlled relative to revenue growth of 6.9%. The operating income to revenue relationship improved, with operating income growing faster than revenue, supporting margin expansion. Overall, the company demonstrates effective cost management and operational leverage, contributing to improved profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 26.03% in 2023 to 23.36% in 2024, positively impacting net profit despite a slight decline in net profit margin from 12.47% to 12.14%. The absence of income tax expense data in 2022 and negative values in some cost and expense lines suggest possible non-recurring or accounting adjustments in that year, which distort comparability. No explicit non-recurring items are reported for 2023 and 2024, indicating stable operational conditions. External factors such as regional revenue growth in Middle East and Africa and Other Asia suggest successful market expansion strategies that may mitigate risks from domestic market saturation. The tax rate reduction and geographic diversification collectively support sustained profitability improvements. |
