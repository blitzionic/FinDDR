# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased steadily from IDR 64,797,500 million in 2022 to IDR 72,597,188 million in 2024, representing a compound growth of approximately 5.7% from 2023 to 2024 and about 4.8% from 2022 to 2023. Gross profit rose from IDR 21,792,300 million in 2022 to IDR 26,893,100 million in 2024, with gross margin stabilizing around 37% in 2023 and 2024 after an anomalously high 166.37% in 2022, likely due to unusual cost or accounting items in 2022. Revenue by product shows the Noodles Division as the dominant contributor, growing from IDR 47.48 trillion in 2022 to IDR 53.87 trillion in 2024, a 13.4% increase over two years. Other divisions such as Dairy and Snack Foods also showed growth, with Dairy slightly fluctuating but overall increasing from IDR 9.44 trillion in 2022 to IDR 9.66 trillion in 2024. Geographic revenue distribution expanded notably; Indonesia remains the largest market with revenue growing from IDR 46.64 trillion in 2022 to IDR 50.03 trillion in 2024. The Middle East and Africa region, not reported in 2022, contributed significantly with IDR 17.36 trillion in 2024, indicating successful geographic expansion. Other Asia and Others regions also showed growth, reflecting diversification in revenue sources. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from IDR 13,377,600 million in 2022 to IDR 16,321,200 million in 2024, with operating margin improving from 20.65% in 2022 to 22.48% in 2024, indicating enhanced operational efficiency. The operating margin's steady rise suggests effective cost control and scaling benefits. Operating expenses decreased significantly from a negative figure of IDR (8,414,700) million in 2022 (likely a reporting anomaly) to positive and controlled levels of IDR 3,701,909 million in 2024, reflecting improved expense management. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved, supporting stronger profitability from core operations. Overall, the company demonstrated better cost management and operational leverage, contributing to margin expansion despite rising revenues. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 26.03% in 2023 to 23.36% in 2024, which positively impacted net profit margins, helping net profit margin remain stable around 12.14% in 2024 compared to 12.47% in 2023 despite higher income tax expense in absolute terms. The absence of income tax expense data in 2022 and unusual figures in cost of goods sold and operating expenses suggest non-recurring or one-off accounting adjustments in that year, which distorted margins and costs. No other explicit non-recurring items are reported for 2023 and 2024. The expansion into new geographic markets such as Middle East and Africa likely introduced external factors affecting profitability, including currency, regulatory, and market entry costs, but these were managed effectively as indicated by margin improvements. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces significant economic challenges stemming from ongoing geopolitical conflicts that threaten global economic stability. Disruptions in major shipping routes have led to surges in energy prices and hampered commodity supplies, resulting in higher energy and raw material costs, increased inflation rates, fluctuations in the rupiah-US dollar exchange rate, and a slowdown in economic growth. Inflation, although easing to 1.57% in 2024, continues to weigh on the purchasing power of lower-income consumers. The rupiah weakened by approximately 4% against the US dollar in 2024 and further weakened to above Rp16,000 in early 2025, partly due to uncertainties surrounding US tariff policies. The Company also faces cost pressures from fluctuating commodity and raw material prices influenced by demand-supply dynamics, weather conditions, consumption trends, local regulations, economic conditions, exchange rates, and geopolitical events. These economic uncertainties persist into 2025, with inflation expected to remain manageable around 3%, but risks remain from geopolitical tensions, China's economic slowdown, and protectionism. The purchasing power of middle-lower income segments is expected to remain impacted by rising prices. The Company manages these risks through close monitoring of economic conditions, cost-saving programs, prudent business expenditures, strengthening supply chains, diversifying suppliers, and operational efficiency improvements including automation and energy management. | The Company faces significant economic challenges including geopolitical conflicts that threaten global economic recovery, disruptions in shipping routes causing surges in energy prices and commodity supply constraints, leading to higher energy and raw material costs, increased inflation, exchange rate fluctuations (rupiah-US dollar), and slower economic growth. Inflationary pressures have impacted the purchasing power of lower-income consumers, influencing consumer behavior towards smaller packaging or more affordable brands. The Company manages these risks through close monitoring of economic conditions, cost-saving programs, prudent expenditure, supply chain diversification, and regular commodity price simulations. The Indonesian economy showed resilience with GDP growth of 5.05% in 2023 and inflation normalized to 2.61%, but high general prices continue to affect lower-income segments. The outlook for 2024 anticipates continued macroeconomic uncertainty with geopolitical tensions, climate change impacts on commodity and energy markets, and volatile raw material prices, although Indonesia's economy is expected to remain resilient with stable inflation around 3% and a stable rupiah. The Company plans to balance top-line growth with profitability, maintain a healthy balance sheet, and continue operational excellence and innovation to navigate these economic challenges. |
