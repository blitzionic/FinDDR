# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Indofood CBP Sukses Makmur Tbk's revenue showed a consistent upward trend from IDR 64,797.5 billion in 2022 to IDR 67,909.9 billion in 2023, reaching IDR 72,597.2 billion in 2024. Despite a seemingly anomalous gross margin of 166.37% in 2022, the gross margin stabilized to a realistic 37.00% in 2023 and slightly improved to 37.04% in 2024, indicating steady cost control relative to revenue. Revenue by product shows the Noodles Division as the dominant contributor, growing from IDR 47.48 trillion in 2022 to IDR 53.87 trillion in 2024, followed by the Dairy Division which remained relatively stable around IDR 9.13-9.66 trillion. Other divisions such as Snack Foods, Food Seasonings, Nutrition and Special Foods, and Beverages also showed growth or stability, supporting diversified revenue streams. Geographically, Indonesia remains the largest market with revenue increasing from IDR 47,622.8 billion in 2023 to IDR 50,025.5 billion in 2024, while Middle East and Africa also showed growth from IDR 16,156.9 billion to IDR 17,359.3 billion, indicating successful regional expansion and market penetration. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved steadily from 20.65% in 2022 to 21.19% in 2023 and further to 22.48% in 2024, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency. Operating income increased from IDR 13,377.6 billion in 2022 to IDR 14,387.6 billion in 2023 and IDR 16,321.2 billion in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and indicating effective cost management. However, the reported operating expenses figures appear inconsistent (e.g., negative and extremely high values), suggesting possible data anomalies; ignoring these, the positive operating margin trend implies disciplined expense control. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved, supporting profitability gains. Overall, the company demonstrated improved cost management and operational leverage over the period, contributing to stronger profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 26.03% in 2023 to 23.36% in 2024, which positively impacted net profit margins despite a slight decline in net profit margin from 12.47% in 2023 to 12.14% in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. The reduction in tax burden likely contributed to sustaining net profit growth from IDR 8,465.1 billion in 2023 to IDR 8,813.4 billion in 2024, supporting overall profitability resilience. |

Inventories increased to IDR 7,059.605 million, which may reflect higher production or stockpiling to meet demand.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased to IDR (2,252.578) million from (3,987.804) million, suggesting more conservative or efficient investment spending.

The debt to equity ratio decreased to 88.00%, indicating a slight reduction in leverage risk compared to 92.04% in 2023. However, interest expense more than doubled to IDR 4,255.593 million, causing interest coverage to decline sharply to 383.52% from 710.60%, which, while still comfortable, signals increased interest burden and potential risk if interest rates rise further. The effective tax rate decreased to 23.36%, reducing tax expense risk. Liquidity improved significantly with the current ratio rising to 408.86%, mitigating short-term liquidity risk. No other explicit risk factors are evident from the data.

Liquidity improved with the current ratio rising to 351.42%, suggesting strong short-term solvency. The effective tax rate of 26.03% is stable and does not indicate tax risk. No significant increases in liabilities or unusual expense spikes were noted aside from the anomalous operating expense figure, which should be investigated. Overall, the company exhibits low financial risk with strong liquidity, manageable leverage, and excellent interest coverage in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | The companyâ€™s investment activity in 2024 was more conservative, with net cash used in investing activities decreasing to IDR (2,252.578) million from the prior year, suggesting a focus on optimizing capital expenditures. Net cash from operations remained robust and stable, supporting sustainable cash flow generation. Dividend payments increased slightly to IDR 2,332.382 million, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue growth across all product divisions, including the introduction of the Beverages Division with IDR 1.67 trillion revenue, and geographic expansion in Indonesia and other regions, suggest diversified growth drivers.

Overall, the company appears well-positioned for continued growth with sustainable cash flows and prudent investment and dividend policies. | The companyâ€™s net cash from operations of IDR 12,415.005 million provides a solid base for sustaining operations and funding investments. Net cash used in investing activities was IDR (3,987.804) million, indicating ongoing investment likely aimed at growth or asset maintenance. Financing cash flow was negative at IDR (4,619.785) million, which may reflect debt repayments or dividend payments, with dividends paid at IDR 2,192.439 million, slightly lower than 2022, suggesting a cautious but consistent dividend policy. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the Noodles Division (IDR 50.44 trillion) and supported by other divisions like Snack Foods and Food Seasonings, while the Dairy Division saw a slight decline. Geographically, Indonesia remains the dominant market (IDR 47,622.817 million), with significant contributions from the Middle East and Africa (IDR 16,156.888 million), indicating geographic diversification.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces economic challenges stemming from ongoing geopolitical conflicts that threaten global economic stability, causing disruptions in shipping routes, surges in energy prices, and hampered commodity supplies. These factors lead to higher energy and raw material costs, increased inflation rates, fluctuations in the rupiah-US dollar exchange rate, and slower economic growth. Inflation, although easing to 1.57% in 2024, continues to pressure the purchasing power of lower-income consumers. The rupiah weakened by approximately 4% against the US dollar in 2024 and further weakened to above Rp16,000 in early 2025 amid uncertainties around US tariff policies. Rising costs of raw and packaging materials, along with weaker purchasing power of middle-lower income segments, remain persistent challenges. The Company also faces cost pressures from commodity and raw material price fluctuations influenced by demand-supply dynamics, weather conditions, consumption trends, local regulations, economic conditions, exchange rates, and geopolitical events. To mitigate these risks, the Company implements cost-saving programs, monitors economic conditions closely, strengthens supply chain partnerships, diversifies raw material sources, and substitutes costly inputs while maintaining product quality. The macroeconomic outlook for 2025 anticipates stable GDP growth around 5%, manageable inflation near 3%, but ongoing risks from geopolitical tensions, China's economic slowdown, and protectionism. The Company expects continued challenges from inflationary pressures and weakened consumer purchasing power, requiring ongoing operational efficiency and market expansion efforts. | The Company faces significant economic challenges stemming from global geopolitical conflicts that threaten post-pandemic economic recovery, causing disruptions in shipping routes, surges in energy prices, and commodity supply constraints. These factors lead to higher energy and raw material costs, increased inflation, exchange rate fluctuations (notably rupiah against the US dollar), and slower economic growth. Inflationary pressures have impacted the purchasing power of lower-income consumers, influencing consumption patterns towards smaller packaging or more affordable brands. The Company manages these risks through close monitoring of economic conditions, cost-saving programs, prudent expenditure, and supply chain diversification including strategic partnerships with local farmers and suppliers. Additionally, commodity and raw material price volatility remains a key uncertainty, with the Company conducting regular price simulations to assess impacts. The Indonesian economy is expected to remain resilient with GDP growth around 5% in 2024, inflation manageable at about 3%, and a stable rupiah, but global macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions continue to pose downside risks. The Company anticipates ongoing challenges such as weaker purchasing power and volatile commodity prices in 2024, requiring continued operational efficiency and strategic brand positioning to maintain growth and profitability. |
