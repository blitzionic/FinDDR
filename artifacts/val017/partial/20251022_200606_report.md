| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators present a mixed picture in 2024. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 88.00% from 92.04%, indicating a slight reduction in leverage. However, interest expense more than doubled to IDR 4,255,593 million from IDR 2,024,713 million, causing interest coverage to decline sharply to 383.52% from an exceptionally high 710.60% in 2023, signaling increased financing cost pressure. The effective tax rate decreased to 23.36% from 26.03%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax regulations. The current ratio improved significantly to 408.86%, indicating strong liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations. Despite higher interest costs, the company maintains comfortable coverage and liquidity levels. No data on retained earnings for 2024 limits assessment of internal capital buffers. Overall, while leverage is moderate and liquidity strong, rising interest expenses warrant monitoring as a potential risk factor. | Leverage risk decreased as debt to equity ratio improved to 92.04% from 100.63%, indicating reduced reliance on debt financing. Interest expense dropped significantly to IDR 2.02 trillion from IDR 6.18 trillion, reducing financial burden. Interest coverage ratio, while still very strong at 710.60%, declined from an exceptionally high 2162.92% in 2022, reflecting higher interest expense relative to operating income but remaining comfortably above risk thresholds. Liquidity risk is low given the current ratio of 351.42%. The effective tax rate increased to 26.03%, which may impact net profitability but is consistent with higher pre-tax income. No unusual risks are evident from the data; however, the decline in gross margin percentage warrants monitoring for cost pressures or pricing challenges. Overall, financial risk is well managed with strong liquidity, reduced leverage, and ample interest coverage. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity in 2024 shows a reduction in net cash used for investing activities to (IDR 2.25 trillion) from (IDR 3.99 trillion) in 2023, suggesting a moderation in capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities remained negative at (IDR 4.31 trillion), slightly lower than the previous year, indicating continued debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends increased to IDR 2.33 trillion from IDR 2.19 trillion, reflecting a stable or slightly more generous dividend policy, supported by steady operational cash flows. Revenue growth across all product divisions and geographic regions, including domestic and overseas markets, suggests diversified growth drivers. The company’s strong liquidity and controlled leverage position it well for sustainable cash flow generation. These factors collectively indicate a positive outlook for future financial performance, with balanced investment and shareholder return strategies supporting ongoing growth and financial stability. | Investment activity intensified in 2023 with net cash used in investing at approximately IDR 3.99 trillion, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions to support growth. The company maintained a sustainable dividend policy, paying out about IDR 2.19 trillion in dividends, reflecting confidence in cash flow sustainability.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces significant economic challenges stemming from ongoing geopolitical conflicts that threaten global economic stability, causing disruptions in shipping routes, surges in energy prices, and hampered commodity supplies. These factors lead to higher energy and raw material costs, increased inflation rates, fluctuations in the rupiah-US dollar exchange rate, and slower economic growth. In Indonesia, despite solid GDP growth of 5.03% in 2024, inflationary pressures and rising prices of essential goods continue to weigh on the purchasing power of lower-income consumers. The rupiah weakened by approximately 4% against the US dollar in 2024 and further depreciated beyond Rp16,000 in early 2025 due to uncertainties including US tariff policies. The Company also faces cost pressures from fluctuating commodity and raw material prices influenced by demand-supply dynamics, weather conditions, regulations, and geopolitical events. For 2025, macroeconomic conditions are expected to remain challenging with weaker purchasing power and rising raw and packaging material costs. The Company plans to mitigate these risks through cost-saving programs, prudent expenditure, strategic sourcing, supply chain strengthening, and productivity improvements. | The Company faces significant economic challenges stemming from global uncertainties such as geopolitical conflicts that threaten post-pandemic economic recovery, disruptions in shipping routes leading to surges in energy prices, and hampered commodity supplies. These factors contribute to higher energy and raw material costs, increased inflation rates, fluctuations in the rupiah-US dollar exchange rate, and slower economic growth. Inflation, although normalized to 2.61% in 2023, remains high enough to impact the purchasing power of lower-income consumers, who tend to shift towards smaller packaging sizes or more affordable brands. The Company also contends with commodity price volatility, particularly in key raw materials like wheat flour, cooking oil, and skim milk powder, which directly affect production costs and product pricing. Foreign exchange risks arise due to borrowings, export sales, and purchases denominated in US dollars, with no formal hedging policy in place. The Company mitigates these risks through close monitoring of economic conditions, cost-saving programs, strategic supply chain partnerships, diversification of suppliers, product price adjustments, and operational efficiencies. Looking ahead to 2024, the Indonesian economy is expected to remain resilient with GDP growth around 5%, manageable inflation near 3%, and a stable rupiah, but global geopolitical tensions and climate change impacts on commodity and energy markets remain uncertainties that could affect business performance. |
