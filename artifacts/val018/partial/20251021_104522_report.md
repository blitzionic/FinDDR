# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased from IDR 30,669.406 million to IDR 36,072.949 million, representing a growth of approximately 2.6% from 2022 to 2023 and 14.6% from 2023 to 2024. Gross profit rose from IDR 6,839.423 million in 2022 to IDR 8,302.299 million in 2024, but gross margin showed a mixed trend: it increased from 22.30% in 2022 to 26.70% in 2023, then declined to 23.02% in 2024, indicating some pressure on cost of goods sold relative to revenue in the latest year. Revenue by product shows that packaged food processing revenue grew from approximately IDR 18,577.821 billion in 2022 to IDR 21,721.710 billion in 2024, a 16.9% increase, while packaged beverages processing revenue increased from IDR 12,091.585 billion to IDR 14,351.240 billion, a 18.7% increase over the same period. This suggests both product lines contributed to revenue growth, with beverages growing slightly faster. Geographically, revenue from Indonesia increased from IDR 17,304.251 billion in 2022 to IDR 20,712.012 billion in 2024 (19.7% growth), Asia revenue grew from IDR 12,595.491 billion to IDR 14,381.290 billion (14.1% growth), and other regions increased from IDR 769.664 billion to IDR 979.647 billion (27.3% growth). The largest revenue share remains Indonesia, but other regions are growing faster percentage-wise, indicating geographic diversification. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from IDR 2,433.115 million in 2022 to IDR 3,915.365 million in 2024, a 60.9% increase over two years. However, operating margin rose from 7.93% in 2022 to 13.66% in 2023 but then declined to 10.85% in 2024, indicating some deterioration in operating efficiency in the latest year despite higher absolute operating income. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that while revenue grew steadily, operating income growth was more volatile, suggesting fluctuating cost management effectiveness. Without detailed operating expense data, it is inferred that cost control was more effective in 2023 but less so in 2024, as reflected by the margin compression. Overall, the company improved operating profitability from 2022 to 2023 but faced challenges maintaining that efficiency in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable over the three years: 21.39% in 2022, 20.74% in 2023, and 20.96% in 2024, indicating consistent tax expense management with no significant tax rate shocks. Net profit increased from IDR 1,970 million in 2022 to IDR 3,068 million in 2024, with net profit margin improving from 6.42% to 8.50%, though it dipped from 10.31% in 2023 to 8.50% in 2024, mirroring the operating margin trend. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns, suggesting profitability changes are primarily driven by operational performance rather than one-off events. External factors such as geographic revenue diversification and product mix shifts likely influenced profitability, but no direct external shocks or one-off impacts are evident from the data. |
