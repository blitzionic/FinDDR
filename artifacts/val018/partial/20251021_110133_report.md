# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased from IDR 30,669.406 million to IDR 36,072.949 million, representing a growth of approximately 2.6% from 2022 to 2023 and 14.6% from 2023 to 2024. Gross profit rose from IDR 6,839.423 million in 2022 to IDR 8,302.299 million in 2024, but gross margin showed a mixed trend: it improved from 22.30% in 2022 to 26.70% in 2023, then declined to 23.02% in 2024, indicating some pressure on direct costs or pricing in the latest year. Revenue by product shows that 'Makanan olahan dalam kemasan' grew from approximately IDR 18,577.821 billion in 2022 to IDR 21,721.710 billion in 2024, a 16.9% increase, while 'Minuman olahan dalam kemasan' increased from IDR 12,091.585 billion to IDR 14,351.240 billion, a 18.7% increase, showing stronger growth in beverages. Geographically, Indonesia revenue grew from IDR 17,304.251 billion in 2022 to IDR 20,712.012 billion in 2024 (19.7% increase), Asia revenue increased from IDR 12,595.491 billion to IDR 14,381.290 billion (14.1% increase), and 'Lain-lain' regions increased from IDR 769.664 billion to IDR 979.647 billion (27.3% increase), indicating broad-based geographic expansion with the highest relative growth in other regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from IDR 2,433.115 million in 2022 to IDR 3,915.365 million in 2024, a 60.9% increase, but operating margin showed a peak in 2023 at 13.66% before declining to 10.85% in 2024. This suggests that while absolute operating profit improved, operating efficiency relative to revenue weakened in 2024. The operating income to revenue ratio declined from 13.66% in 2023 to 10.85% in 2024, indicating rising operating costs or less favorable cost structure. Cost management appears challenged in 2024 as gross margin also declined, implying increased cost of goods sold or less pricing power. Despite revenue growth, the company’s ability to convert sales into operating profit has deteriorated somewhat in the latest year. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable over the three years, slightly decreasing from 21.39% in 2022 to 20.96% in 2024, which had a modest positive impact on net profitability. Income tax expense increased in line with higher pre-tax profits, from IDR 535.993 million in 2022 to IDR 813.427 million in 2024. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the provided information. External factors affecting profitability are not detailed, but the stable tax rate and consistent net profit margin decline from 10.31% in 2023 to 8.50% in 2024 suggest that external tax or regulatory impacts were minimal, and the main profitability pressures likely stem from internal cost and margin dynamics. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a stronger overall financial position compared to 2023, with total assets increasing from IDR 23,870,405 million to IDR 29,728,782 million, indicating significant asset growth. Current assets rose notably from IDR 14,738,922 million to IDR 19,600,915 million, enhancing liquidity potential. Total liabilities also increased substantially from IDR 8,588,316 million to IDR 12,626,354 million, reflecting higher leverage but still supported by a solid equity base that grew from IDR 15,282,089 million to IDR 17,102,428 million. The equity growth suggests retained earnings or capital injections strengthened the shareholders' position. Current liabilities surged from IDR 4,013,200 million to IDR 7,383,111 million, which may pressure short-term liquidity. Inventories decreased from IDR 3,870,496 million to IDR 3,556,864 million, potentially improving working capital efficiency. Overall, the balance sheet shows growth with increased assets and equity, but rising liabilities and current liabilities warrant close monitoring for liquidity management and capital structure optimization. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from IDR 22,276,161 million in 2022 to IDR 23,870,405 million, indicating asset growth. Total liabilities decreased from IDR 9,441,467 million to IDR 8,588,316 million, reflecting effective liability management. Shareholders' equity strengthened significantly, rising from IDR 12,834,694 million to IDR 15,282,089 million, enhancing the equity base and overall balance sheet strength. Current assets slightly decreased from IDR 14,772,624 million to IDR 14,738,922 million, while current liabilities reduced more substantially from IDR 5,636,627 million to IDR 4,013,200 million, suggesting improved short-term liquidity. The inventory figure remained constant at IDR 3,870,496,137,257, but given the unit inconsistency, no inference is drawn. Overall, the company improved its capital structure by reducing liabilities and increasing equity, supporting a stronger financial health profile in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by approximately 14.6% from IDR 31,485,008 million in 2023 to IDR 36,072,949 million in 2024, driven by growth in both main product lines and geographic regions. However, gross profit slightly declined from IDR 8,407,778 million to IDR 8,302,299 million, causing the gross margin to drop from 26.70% to 23.02%, indicating increased cost pressures or pricing challenges. Operating income decreased from IDR 4,299,475 million to IDR 3,915,365 million, with operating margin falling from 13.66% to 10.85%, reflecting higher operating costs or less efficient cost control (operating expenses data unavailable). Net profit declined from IDR 3,245 million to IDR 3,068 million, with net profit margin contracting from 10.31% to 8.50%, signaling reduced earnings quality and profitability sustainability. The effective tax rate remained stable around 21%. Interest expense increased significantly from IDR 302 million to IDR 425 million, further pressuring net income. Overall, while top-line growth is positive, profitability margins and earnings quality weakened in 2024. | The company showed marked improvement in profitability in 2023. Revenue increased modestly from IDR 30,669,406 million in 2022 to IDR 31,485,008 million. Cost of goods sold decreased from IDR 23,829,983 million to IDR 23,077,230 million, leading to a significant gross profit increase from IDR 6,839,423 million to IDR 8,407,778 million. Gross margin improved from 22.30% to 26.70%, indicating better cost control or pricing power. Operating income rose sharply from IDR 2,433,115 million to IDR 4,299,475 million, with operating margin nearly doubling from 7.93% to 13.66%. Net profit increased from IDR 1,970 million to IDR 3,245 million, and net profit margin improved from 6.42% to 10.31%, reflecting enhanced earnings quality and sustainability. Income before taxes and net profit growth were supported by a slightly lower effective tax rate (20.74% vs. 21.39%). Interest expense decreased, improving earnings quality further. Overall, profitability and earnings quality in 2023 showed strong improvement and sustainability. |
| Operational efficiency | The company’s operating margin decreased to 10.85% in 2024 from 13.66% in 2023, indicating reduced operational efficiency or higher cost base relative to revenue. Gross margin also declined, suggesting cost of goods sold increased disproportionately to revenue growth. Asset turnover and other asset utilization ratios are unavailable, limiting detailed efficiency analysis. Net cash from operations turned sharply negative to IDR (463,359) million in 2024 from a positive IDR 5,259,182 million in 2023, signaling significant operational cash flow challenges despite revenue growth. Inventories decreased, which may reflect better inventory management or sales mix changes. Working capital pressures are implied by the large increase in current liabilities and negative operating cash flow. Overall, operational efficiency appears to have deteriorated in 2024, with cash flow from operations a key concern. | Operational efficiency improved significantly in 2023. The company increased gross profit and operating income margins, indicating better cost control despite unavailable operating expense data. The reduction in cost of goods sold alongside revenue growth suggests improved production or procurement efficiency. Net cash from operations surged from IDR 1,619,000,000,000 in 2022 to IDR 5,259,181,989,696 in 2023, demonstrating strong cash generation capability. Working capital management appears improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, though current ratio data is unavailable. Asset turnover and other asset utilization ratios are not provided, limiting further analysis. Overall, the company enhanced operational efficiency with stronger cash flows and margin expansion in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show increased leverage and liquidity risk in 2024. Total liabilities rose sharply by nearly 47% to IDR 12,626,354 million, with current liabilities almost doubling to IDR 7,383,111 million, potentially straining short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased by about 40%, from IDR 302 million to IDR 425 million, while interest coverage ratio declined from an extremely high 1420.95% in 2023 to 920.84% in 2024, indicating reduced but still strong ability to cover interest costs. The effective tax rate remained stable, suggesting no tax-related risk changes. The negative net cash from operations combined with rising liabilities and interest expense signals elevated financial risk and warrants close monitoring. Absence of debt to equity and current ratio data limits full risk assessment but trends suggest increasing leverage and liquidity pressures. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023. Interest expense decreased from IDR 389,183 million to IDR 302,577 million, while income before interest and taxes increased, resulting in a substantial rise in interest coverage ratio from 625.19% to 1420.95%, indicating a much stronger ability to service debt. Total liabilities decreased, reducing leverage risk, though debt to equity ratio is unavailable. The effective tax rate slightly declined, reducing tax burden risk. Liquidity indicators such as current ratio are not provided, but the reduction in current liabilities and strong cash flow from operations suggest improved liquidity. No data on non-current liabilities or contingent liabilities is available. Overall, the company’s financial risk profile improved with lower leverage, higher interest coverage, and better liquidity in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities continued with net cash used in investing at IDR (1,628,863) million in 2024, slightly lower than 2023, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting growth. Financing cash flow turned positive to IDR 2,428,387 million from negative in 2023, suggesting new debt or equity financing inflows to support operations or investments. Dividends increased in payout to IDR (1,229,728) million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite operational cash flow challenges. Revenue growth in key product segments—Makanan olahan dalam kemasan and Minuman olahan dalam kemasan—and geographic regions, especially Indonesia and Asia, indicates expanding market presence and potential for future top-line growth. However, negative operating cash flow and rising liabilities may constrain financial flexibility. Overall, the company appears focused on growth and shareholder returns but must address cash flow sustainability and leverage to ensure future financial stability. | Investment activities increased in 2023, with net cash used in investing activities rising from negative IDR 1,546,000,000,000 to negative IDR 2,359,457,241,900, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting future growth. Net cash from financing activities showed a larger outflow (IDR -1,975,978,291,736 vs. IDR -49,000,000,000), possibly reflecting debt repayments or increased dividend payments, as dividends paid increased from IDR -469,532,694,225 to IDR -782,554,490,375, signaling a shareholder-friendly policy. Revenue growth was driven by both product segments and geographic regions: packaged food revenue increased from IDR 18,577,821,248,451 to IDR 18,966,064,907,406, and packaged beverages from IDR 12,091,584,718,953 to IDR 12,518,943,278,119. Geographically, revenue from Indonesia and Asia increased, while other regions declined slightly. The strong operational cash flow and investment in growth suggest sustainable future performance, supported by expanding markets and product lines. However, increased investing and financing outflows warrant monitoring for cash flow sustainability. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Company faces market risks including intense competition in the food and beverage sector from local and international producers, requiring continuous product innovation, marketing strategies, and adaptation to changes in market demand and consumer purchasing power. Macro-economic conditions such as economic, social, political, and security changes domestically and internationally significantly influence business activities.

Macro-economic conditions such as changes in economic, social, political, and security environments domestically and internationally impact business activities and performance. Foreign exchange risk arises primarily from exposure to the US Dollar and other currencies, affecting future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. The Company manages this risk by requiring hedging of foreign exchange exposures and measuring risk via cash flow forecasts. Fluctuations in exchange rates, especially weakening of the Rupiah, can increase production costs due to imported raw materials or local materials priced internationally. The Company mitigates this by maximizing domestic raw material use, increasing export sales, and hedging when necessary. Government policies, social and political risks, including regulations affecting purchasing power, production costs, and export-import restrictions, can impact production absorption and performance. The Company mitigates international regulatory risks by diversifying export markets globally.
