# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Mayora Indah Tbk's revenue showed a steady increase from IDR 30,669.406 million in 2022 to IDR 31,485.008 million in 2023, and further to IDR 36,072.949 million in 2024, indicating positive top-line growth. However, the gross margin declined from an anomalous figure in 2022 (likely data error) to 26.70% in 2023 and further down to 23.02% in 2024, suggesting rising cost pressures or pricing challenges. Revenue by product shows growth in both packaged food processing (from IDR 18,577.821 billion in 2022 to IDR 21,864.728 billion in 2024) and packaged beverages processing (from IDR 12,091.585 billion in 2022 to IDR 18,626.904 billion in 2024), with beverages growing at a faster pace. Geographically, revenue increased across all regions, with Indonesia leading (IDR 17,304.251 billion in 2022 to IDR 20,712.012 billion in 2024), followed by Asia and others, reflecting strong domestic and regional market expansion. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 7.93% in 2022 to 13.66% in 2023 but then declined to 10.85% in 2024, indicating fluctuating operating efficiency. Operating income rose significantly from IDR 2,433.115 million in 2022 to IDR 4,299.475 million in 2023 but decreased to IDR 3,915.365 million in 2024, despite revenue growth, suggesting increased operating expenses or inefficiencies. Operating expenses decreased from an anomalous high in 2022 (likely data error) to IDR 4,108.302 million in 2023 but increased again to IDR 4,386.935 million in 2024, indicating some cost management challenges. Overall, while revenue grew, the company faced pressure on operating income margins due to rising costs. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from 21.39% in 2022 to 20.74% in 2023 and 20.96% in 2024, indicating consistent tax expense management with minimal impact on profitability. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, suggesting that the profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Mayora Indah Tbk demonstrated growth in total assets, increasing from IDR 23,870,404,962,472 million in 2023 to IDR 29,728,781,933,757 million, reflecting significant asset expansion. Current assets rose substantially from IDR 14,738,922,387,529 million to IDR 19,600,914,916,989 million, while non-current assets increased moderately. Total liabilities grew markedly by about 47%, from IDR 8,588,315,775,736 million to IDR 12,626,353,599,187 million, with current liabilities nearly doubling, indicating increased short-term obligations. Shareholders' equity increased from IDR 15,282,089,186,736 million to IDR 17,102,428,334,570 million, supporting a stronger equity base but the debt to equity ratio rose from 56.20% to 73.83%, signaling a higher leverage and more aggressive capital structure. The current ratio declined from 367.26% to 265.48%, indicating reduced but still strong liquidity. Overall, the company expanded its asset base and equity but took on more liabilities, especially short-term, which may pressure liquidity despite a still comfortable current ratio. | In 2023, PT Mayora Indah Tbk demonstrated improved financial health compared to 2022. Total assets increased from IDR 22.276 trillion to IDR 23.870 trillion, driven by growth in non-current assets from IDR 7.504 trillion to IDR 9.131 trillion, while current assets slightly decreased. Total liabilities decreased from IDR 9.441 trillion to IDR 8.588 trillion, with a notable reduction in current liabilities from IDR 5.637 trillion to IDR 4.013 trillion, though non-current liabilities increased from IDR 3.805 trillion to IDR 4.575 trillion. Shareholders' equity rose significantly from IDR 12.835 trillion to IDR 15.282 trillion, supported by retained earnings growth from IDR 12.136 trillion to IDR 14.552 trillion. Liquidity improved markedly as the current ratio increased from 262.08% to 367.26%, indicating stronger short-term financial stability. The capital structure became more conservative with the debt to equity ratio declining from 73.56% to 56.20%, reflecting reduced leverage and enhanced equity base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by approximately 14.6% from IDR 31,485,008 million in 2023 to IDR 36,072,949 million in 2024, driven by growth in both packaged food and beverage segments and across all geographic regions. However, gross profit slightly decreased from IDR 8,407,778 million to IDR 8,302,299 million, causing the gross margin to decline from 26.70% to 23.02%. Operating income fell from IDR 4,299,475 million to IDR 3,915,365 million, with operating margin dropping from 13.66% to 10.85%, reflecting increased operating expenses. Net profit decreased from IDR 3,244,872 million to IDR 3,068,000 million, and net profit margin declined from 10.31% to 8.50%. The effective tax rate remained stable around 21%. Interest expense increased significantly, reducing income before taxes and compressing margins. Return on equity and assets are reported as 0.00%, likely unavailable or negligible. Overall, while top-line growth was strong, profitability margins and net earnings quality weakened due to rising costs and interest expenses. | The company showed strong profitability improvements in 2023. Revenue increased modestly from IDR 30,669.406 million to IDR 31,485.008 million. Gross profit rose significantly from IDR 6,839.423 million to IDR 8,407.778 million, improving the gross margin to 26.70% from an anomalous 2022 figure. Operating income nearly doubled from IDR 2,433.115 million to IDR 4,299.475 million, lifting the operating margin to 13.66% from 7.93%. Net profit surged from IDR 1,970.065 million to IDR 3,244.872 million, with net profit margin increasing to 10.31% from 6.42%. Income before taxes and net profit growth were supported by controlled income tax expense and reduced interest expense. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 20.74% from 21.39%. Return on equity and return on assets were reported as 0.00%, likely due to data reporting issues, but the strong margin improvements indicate enhanced earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost of goods sold rose sharply from IDR 23,077,230 million to IDR 27,770,650 million, outpacing revenue growth and pressuring gross profit. Operating expenses increased from IDR 4,108,302 million to IDR 4,386,935 million, indicating some cost control challenges. Inventories nearly doubled from IDR 3,556,864 million to IDR 6,437,102 million, which may suggest slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. Net cash from operations turned negative at IDR (463,359) million in 2024 from a positive IDR 5,259,182 million in 2023, signaling operational cash flow stress despite reported net profits. Asset turnover and return metrics are unavailable, limiting assessment of asset utilization. The negative operating cash flow combined with rising inventories and liabilities suggests operational inefficiencies and working capital management issues in 2024. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023 as evidenced by better cost control and higher profitability margins. Cost of goods sold decreased relative to revenue, contributing to a higher gross profit. Operating expenses decreased from IDR 5,015 million to IDR 4,108 million, supporting a higher operating income. Inventories were reduced from IDR 3.871 trillion to IDR 3.557 trillion, indicating better inventory management. Net cash from operations increased substantially from IDR 1.619 trillion to IDR 5.259 trillion, reflecting improved cash generation from core business activities. Despite increased investing cash outflows (from negative IDR 1.546 trillion to negative IDR 2.359 trillion), the company maintained positive net cash flow with a net increase in cash of IDR 924 billion. These factors collectively suggest enhanced asset utilization and operational cash flow efficiency. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased notably with debt to equity rising from 56.20% to 73.83%, reflecting higher reliance on debt financing. Current liabilities nearly doubled, causing the current ratio to decline from 367.26% to 265.48%, though still indicating strong liquidity. Interest expense increased by about 40%, from IDR 302,577 million to IDR 425,196 million, while interest coverage ratio dropped from 1420.95% to 920.84%, indicating reduced but still comfortable ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate remained stable, so no tax risk changes are evident. The negative net cash from operations and increased short-term liabilities raise early warning flags on liquidity and operational cash flow sustainability. The increased leverage and cash flow stress could elevate financial risk if trends persist. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023. The debt to equity ratio declined from 73.56% to 56.20%, indicating reduced financial leverage and lower solvency risk. The current ratio increased significantly to 367.26%, reflecting strong liquidity and ability to cover short-term obligations. Interest expense decreased from IDR 389 billion to IDR 303 million, and interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 1420.95%, signaling excellent capacity to meet interest payments. The effective tax rate slightly decreased, which may marginally improve net profitability. However, the increase in non-current liabilities from IDR 3.805 trillion to IDR 4.575 trillion warrants monitoring for long-term debt obligations. Overall, the company’s financial risk profile appears substantially mitigated in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity remains significant with net cash used in investing at IDR (1,628,863) million, though lower than 2023, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions. Financing cash flow turned positive at IDR 2,428,387 million in 2024 from negative in 2023, suggesting new debt or equity inflows supporting liquidity. Dividend payments increased to IDR (1,229,728) million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite cash flow challenges. Revenue growth in both packaged food and beverage segments and across Indonesia, Asia, and other regions indicates diversified growth drivers. However, operational cash flow negativity and rising leverage may constrain future financial flexibility. The company appears to be investing for growth while managing higher debt and maintaining dividends, but cash flow sustainability and working capital efficiency will be critical to monitor for future performance. | The company’s future financial performance appears positive based on 2023 data. Significant net cash from operations (IDR 5.259 trillion) supports sustainable cash flow generation. However, increased net cash used in investing activities (IDR -2.359 trillion) and financing activities (IDR -1.976 trillion) indicate ongoing investment and debt repayment or dividend distribution strategies. Dividends paid increased to IDR 783 billion, reflecting a shareholder-friendly policy. Revenue growth in key segments such as packaged food processing (increased from IDR 18.578 trillion to IDR 18.999 trillion) and packaged beverages (from IDR 12.092 trillion to IDR 14.983 trillion) suggests strong market demand and geographic expansion, particularly in Indonesia and Asia. These factors combined suggest the company is investing for growth while maintaining cash flow sustainability and shareholder returns. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Company faces market risks including intense competition in the food and beverage sector from local and international producers, requiring continuous product innovation, promotional strategies, and adaptation to changes in market demand and consumer purchasing power. Macro-economic conditions such as economic, social, political, and security changes domestically and internationally significantly influence business activities. Global factors like commodity price volatility, political instability in several countries affecting export distribution costs, and international trade protectionism also pose risks. The Company mitigates these risks by maintaining product quality, developing differentiated new products to expand market share, monitoring economic changes closely, and diversifying export markets to reduce negative impacts from international regulatory changes or export bans. | The Company faces market risks including intense competition in the food and beverage sector from local and international producers, requiring continuous product innovation and marketing strategies to maintain and expand market share. Economic, social, political, and security conditions domestically and internationally impact business activities and consumer purchasing power. Foreign exchange risk arises primarily from exposure to the US Dollar and other currencies, affecting future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. The Company manages this by hedging its entire foreign exchange exposure and maximizing domestic raw material use while increasing export sales. Government policies, social and political changes, global monetary policies, and political tensions can affect production costs, supply chains, and export-import performance. The Company mitigates risks from export bans and import duties by diversifying export markets globally. Fluctuations in raw material prices and distribution costs due to global pressures and climate change also pose risks to market conditions. |
