# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | PT Mayora Indah Tbk's revenue increased steadily from IDR 30,669,405,967,404 in 2022 to IDR 31,485,008,185,525 in 2023, and further to IDR 36,072,949,285,930 in 2024, showing a strong growth trajectory. However, the gross margin declined significantly from 36.94% in 2022 to 26.70% in 2023 and further to 23.02% in 2024, indicating rising cost pressures or pricing challenges. Revenue by product shows that packaged food processing consistently leads, growing from IDR 18,655,730,077,716 in 2022 to IDR 21,864,728,479,460 in 2024, while packaged beverages processing also increased from IDR 13,824,995,710,976 in 2022 to IDR 18,626,903,565,647 in 2024. Geographically, Indonesia remains the largest market with revenue rising from IDR 17,771,643,898,492 in 2023 to IDR 20,712,012,198,077 in 2024, followed by Asia with growth from IDR 13,049,940,231,980 in 2023 to IDR 14,381,289,830,851 in 2024, indicating strong domestic and regional demand. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 7.93% in 2022 to 13.66% in 2023 but then declined to 10.85% in 2024, reflecting some volatility in operational profitability. Operating income rose from IDR 2,433,114,641,701 in 2022 to IDR 4,299,475,347,200 in 2023 before decreasing to IDR 3,915,364,772,118 in 2024, while revenue increased steadily, suggesting that operating income growth did not keep pace with revenue in the latest year. Operating expenses decreased from IDR 5,015,000,000,000 in 2022 to IDR 4,108,302,411,483 in 2023 but then increased to IDR 4,386,934,542,139 in 2024, indicating some cost management challenges in 2024 after initial improvement. Overall, the company shows moderate operating efficiency with room to better control costs relative to revenue growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from 21.39% in 2022 to 20.74% in 2023 and 20.96% in 2024, which had a modest impact on net profitability. There are no explicitly listed non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability in the provided data. The steady tax rate suggests consistent tax management without significant one-off tax events influencing net profit. External factors impacting profitability are not detailed in the data, so the analysis is limited to observed financial trends. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, PT Mayora Indah Tbk demonstrated growth in total assets, increasing from IDR 23.87 trillion in 2023 to IDR 29.73 trillion, driven by rises in both current assets (IDR 19.60 trillion) and non-current assets (IDR 10.13 trillion). Total liabilities also increased significantly from IDR 8.59 trillion to IDR 12.63 trillion, with current liabilities rising sharply to IDR 7.38 trillion and non-current liabilities to IDR 5.24 trillion. Shareholders' equity grew moderately from IDR 15.28 trillion to IDR 17.10 trillion, supported by an increase in retained earnings to IDR 16.38 trillion. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 367.26% to 265.48%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity buffer but still a comfortable level above 1. The debt to equity ratio increased from 56.20% to 73.83%, reflecting a higher leverage and a shift towards more debt financing in the capital structure. Overall, the company’s financial health shows asset growth and equity strengthening but with increased leverage and somewhat reduced liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, PT Mayora Indah Tbk demonstrated improved financial health compared to 2022. Total assets increased from IDR 22.28 trillion to IDR 23.87 trillion, driven by a rise in non-current assets from IDR 7.50 trillion to IDR 9.13 trillion, while current assets slightly decreased. Total liabilities decreased from IDR 9.44 trillion to IDR 8.59 trillion, with a notable reduction in current liabilities from IDR 5.64 trillion to IDR 4.01 trillion, though non-current liabilities increased from IDR 3.81 trillion to IDR 4.58 trillion. Shareholders' equity grew significantly from IDR 12.84 trillion to IDR 15.28 trillion, supported by a large increase in retained earnings from IDR 1.19 trillion to IDR 14.61 trillion. Liquidity improved markedly as reflected by the current ratio rising from 262.07% to 367.26%, indicating stronger short-term financial stability. The capital structure became more conservative with the debt to equity ratio declining from 73.56% to 56.20%, suggesting reduced reliance on debt financing and enhanced equity base strength. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by approximately 14.6% from IDR 31.49 trillion in 2023 to IDR 36.07 trillion in 2024, driven by growth in both packaged food (from IDR 18.99 trillion to IDR 21.86 trillion) and packaged beverages (from IDR 14.98 trillion to IDR 18.63 trillion). Despite higher revenue, gross profit margin declined from 26.70% to 23.02%, indicating increased cost pressures as cost of goods sold rose disproportionately. Operating income decreased from IDR 4.30 trillion to IDR 3.92 trillion, with operating margin falling from 13.66% to 10.85%. Net profit also declined from IDR 3.24 trillion to IDR 3.07 trillion, with net margin dropping from 10.31% to 8.50%. Return on equity and return on assets both decreased, from 23.08% to 18.95% and 14.06% to 11.45% respectively, signaling reduced earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns. The effective tax rate remained stable around 21%. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 despite revenue growth, reflecting margin compression and lower returns. | PT Mayora Indah Tbk's profitability improved substantially in 2023. Revenue increased modestly by approximately 2.6% from IDR 30.67 trillion to IDR 31.49 trillion. Despite the increase in cost of goods sold from IDR 19.34 trillion to IDR 23.08 trillion, gross profit declined sharply from IDR 6.84 trillion to IDR 841 billion, causing gross margin to drop from 36.94% to 26.70%. However, operating income nearly doubled from IDR 2.43 trillion to IDR 4.30 trillion, resulting in a significant improvement in operating margin from 7.93% to 13.66%. Net profit rose strongly by about 64.7% from IDR 1.97 trillion to IDR 3.24 trillion, lifting net profit margin from 6.42% to 10.31%. Return on equity and return on assets were reported for 2023 at 23.08% and 14.06% respectively, indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate slightly decreased from 21.39% to 20.74%, contributing positively to net profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost control appears challenged in 2024 as cost of goods sold increased significantly from IDR 23.08 trillion to IDR 27.77 trillion, outpacing revenue growth. Operating expenses also rose modestly from IDR 4.11 trillion to IDR 4.39 trillion. Asset turnover slightly decreased from 136.46% to 134.60%, indicating a marginal decline in asset utilization efficiency. Inventories nearly doubled from IDR 3.56 trillion to IDR 6.44 trillion, which may suggest slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. Net cash from operations turned negative to IDR -463 billion from a positive IDR 5.26 trillion in 2023, signaling operational cash flow stress. Working capital increased as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, but the sharp rise in current liabilities to IDR 7.38 trillion may pressure short-term operational liquidity. Cash flow from investing remained negative but improved slightly, while financing cash flow turned positive to IDR 2.43 trillion, indicating increased borrowing or capital inflows. Overall, operational efficiency weakened in 2024 with rising costs, inventory buildup, and negative operating cash flow. | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2023. Cost control was challenged as cost of goods sold increased significantly, impacting gross profit negatively. However, operating expenses were reduced from IDR 5.02 trillion to IDR 4.11 trillion, reflecting improved expense management. Asset utilization was strong with an asset turnover ratio of 136.46%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations surged from IDR 1.62 trillion to IDR 5.26 trillion, demonstrating robust cash generation capability. Inventories increased substantially from IDR 2.16 trillion to IDR 3.56 trillion, which may suggest higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased and current assets remained stable, supporting liquidity. Overall, cash flow from operations is strong, but inventory management may require attention. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased notably in 2024, with the debt to equity ratio rising from 56.20% to 73.83%, reflecting higher reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased from IDR 303 billion to IDR 425 billion, while interest coverage ratio declined sharply from 1420.95% to 920.84%, indicating reduced but still strong ability to cover interest payments. Liquidity risk increased as the current ratio dropped from 367.26% to 265.48%, though it remains well above 100%, suggesting manageable short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate remained stable at approximately 21%, indicating no significant tax risk changes. The negative net cash from operations and increased current liabilities may pose early warning signs of cash flow stress. The substantial increase in inventories and liabilities could also signal operational or market risks. Overall, financial risk has increased moderately in 2024, with higher leverage and reduced liquidity cushions warranting close monitoring. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023. Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio fell from 73.56% to 56.20%, reducing financial risk exposure. Liquidity strengthened with the current ratio rising from 262.07% to 367.26%, indicating ample short-term asset coverage for liabilities. Interest expense declined from IDR 389 billion to IDR 303 billion, while interest coverage ratio soared from 625.19% to 1420.95%, reflecting a much stronger ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate slightly decreased, which may reduce tax-related risks. However, the increase in non-current liabilities from IDR 3.81 trillion to IDR 4.58 trillion warrants monitoring for long-term obligations. No other explicit risk factors are evident from the data provided. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity remains significant with net cash used in investing at IDR -1.63 trillion, though lower than the prior year, indicating continued capital expenditure or acquisitions. The positive net cash from financing of IDR 2.43 trillion suggests increased borrowing or capital raising, potentially to support growth or liquidity needs. Dividend payments increased substantially from IDR 783 billion to IDR 1.23 trillion, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite profitability pressures. Revenue growth in both packaged food and beverages, as well as geographic expansion with increased sales in Indonesia, Asia, and other regions, indicates positive market demand and diversification. However, operational cash flow challenges and rising leverage may constrain future financial flexibility. The company’s ability to sustain cash flow and manage working capital will be critical for maintaining dividend policy and funding growth. Overall, the outlook suggests cautious optimism with growth opportunities balanced against financial and operational risks. | The company’s future financial performance appears promising based on 2023 data. Investment activity increased as net cash used in investing activities rose from IDR -1.55 trillion to IDR -2.36 trillion, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions to support growth. Net cash from operations is robust at IDR 5.26 trillion, supporting cash flow sustainability. Financing cash outflows increased significantly to IDR -1.98 trillion, possibly reflecting debt repayments or dividend payments, with dividends rising from IDR 470 billion to IDR 783 billion, signaling a shareholder-friendly dividend policy. Revenue growth in key segments such as packaged food processing and packaged beverages processing continued, with geographic revenue concentration primarily in Indonesia and Asia, suggesting stable market presence and potential for regional expansion. Overall, the company is positioned for sustained growth with strong operational cash flow and strategic investments. |
