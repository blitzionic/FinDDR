| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin data is not available for 2023 and 2024, but the net profit margin has decreased from 11.24% in 2022 to 5.81% in 2024, indicating a deterioration in overall operational efficiency. The operating expenses have slightly increased from $39,476 million in 2022 to $36,917 million in 2024, despite the significant drop in revenue, suggesting that cost management may not be effectively aligned with revenue changes, leading to reduced profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 33.85% in 2022 to 39.82% in 2023, which could have negatively impacted net profit margins. The income tax expense decreased from $21,941 million in 2022 to $12,991 million in 2023, reflecting a potential one-off impact or changes in tax strategy. External factors such as market conditions and regional economic performance appear to be affecting profitability, particularly in Europe and the USA, where revenue has significantly declined. |

| Operational efficiency | In 2024, the operating expenses were $36,917 million, a decrease from $39,960 million in 2023, which may indicate improved cost management. However, the lack of operating income data limits a comprehensive analysis of operating efficiency.

| Financial risk identification and early warning | In 2024, the debt to equity ratio improved slightly to 115.14%, indicating stable leverage management. The current ratio of 134.61% suggests adequate liquidity, although it is a decline from the previous year. The interest expense increased to $4,787 million, which may indicate rising financial risk. The absence of effective tax rate data for 2024 limits the assessment of tax-related risks. Overall, while leverage appears manageable, the increase in interest expense could signal potential financial strain. | In 2023, the debt to equity ratio was 115.69%, indicating a stable leverage position. The current ratio of 140.48% reflects strong liquidity, providing a buffer against financial risks. The interest expense was $4,673 million, which was manageable relative to the net profit. The effective tax rate was 39.82%, which is higher than the previous year, indicating potential tax-related risks. Overall, the financial risk profile appeared stable, but the rising tax rate could pose future challenges. |
| Future financial performance projection | Based on the 2024 data, the company may face challenges in future financial performance due to declining revenue and profitability metrics. The decrease in total assets and equity suggests potential difficulties in sustaining growth. However, the positive cash flow from operations indicates some level of operational stability. The company may need to focus on cost management and explore new revenue streams to improve financial health moving forward. | In 2023, the company showed signs of potential growth despite declining revenue. The stable cash flow from operations and manageable debt levels suggest a foundation for future investments. However, the declining profitability metrics indicate a need for strategic adjustments. The company should focus on market expansion and innovation to enhance revenue growth and improve overall financial performance in the coming years. |

# Section 6: Future Outlook

## S6.1: Strategic Direction

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | We are subject to differing economic and financial market conditions around the world, with political or economic instability affecting such markets. Access to debt markets may become more challenging, impacting our liquidity. We are exposed to changes in currency values and exchange controls due to our substantial international operations. Volatility in capital markets or changes to government policies could affect inflation, interest rates, and investment performance, leading to significant changes in the funding level of future liabilities. Global macroeconomic uncertainties, including low oil and gas price environments and long-term demand reduction, pose high risks to our earnings and cash flows. | The expected economic slowdown and potential supply disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions could impact demand in 2024. Macroeconomic risks and demand concerns had already started weighing on the market from the fourth quarter of 2023, with Brent prices dropping significantly. The instability in the Middle East remains a significant risk factor, with potential escalation of conflicts affecting oil trade routes. Global economic growth in 2023 was moderate, hindered by the Russia-Ukraine war, international trade restrictions, and rising interest rates aimed at controlling inflation.
