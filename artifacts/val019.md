# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue has shown a declining trend from 2022 to 2024, decreasing from $381,314 million in 2022 to $316,620 million in 2023, and further down to $284,312 million in 2024, representing a total decline of approximately 25.5%. The gross margin has improved slightly from 32.21% in 2022 to 33.83% in 2024, indicating better cost management relative to revenue. In terms of product revenue, crude oil and oil products have seen significant declines, with crude oil dropping from $46,523 million in 2022 to $40,625 million in 2024, and oil products from $173,840 million to $129,554 million. Geographically, revenue from Europe has decreased from $135,975 million in 2022 to $92,480 million in 2024, while revenue from Asia, Oceania, and Africa has remained relatively stable, indicating a shift in market dynamics. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin data is not available for 2023 and 2024, but the net profit margin has decreased from 11.24% in 2022 to 5.81% in 2024, reflecting a significant decline in profitability. Operating expenses have slightly increased from $39,476 million in 2022 to $39,960 million in 2023, before decreasing to $36,917 million in 2024, suggesting some cost management effectiveness in the latter year. However, the overall relationship between operating income and revenue indicates a deteriorating operational performance as revenue declines outpace any improvements in cost management. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has increased significantly from 33.85% in 2022 to 44.79% in 2024, which has negatively impacted net profit margins. Non-recurring items are not explicitly mentioned, but the overall decline in revenue and profitability suggests potential external factors such as market volatility or regulatory changes affecting the industry. The substantial drop in net profit from $42,874 million in 2022 to $16,521 million in 2024 highlights the impact of these external pressures on the company's financial health. |

The current ratio of 134.61% suggests adequate liquidity to cover short-term obligations. However, the effective tax rate increased to 44.79%, which could pose a risk to net earnings. Overall, while leverage appears manageable, the rising tax rate presents a potential risk factor. | In 2023, the debt to equity ratio was 115.69%, indicating a stable leverage position. The current ratio of 140.48% demonstrated strong liquidity, allowing the company to meet its short-term liabilities comfortably.

Overall, the financial risk indicators were positive, with manageable debt levels and strong liquidity. |
| Future financial performance projection | Based on the 2024 data, the company may face challenges in revenue growth due to declining sales figures. The increase in net cash from operations is a positive sign for cash flow sustainability, but the rising effective tax rate could impact future profitability. The company should focus on cost management and exploring new market opportunities to enhance growth. The dividend policy remains stable with an increase to $8,668 million, indicating a commitment to returning value to shareholders despite the challenges. | In 2023, the company showed signs of potential growth with a revenue of $316,620 million, although it was lower than in 2022. The net cash from operations was stable, suggesting good cash flow management. The increase in dividends to $8,389 million reflects a positive outlook for shareholder returns. However, the declining profitability metrics indicate that the company needs to address operational efficiencies and explore new markets to sustain future growth. |

# Section 6: Future Outlook

## S6.1: Strategic Direction

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mergers and Acquisition | In October 2024, we signed an agreement to acquire RISEC Holdings, which owns a 609 MW two-unit combined-cycle gas turbine power plant in Rhode Island, USA.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Global macroeconomic uncertainties, including inflation and geopolitical tensions, have negatively impacted oil product and chemical margins, leading to long-term demand reduction. The volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, influenced by supply and demand dynamics, operational issues, and political instability, poses significant risks to revenue and profitability. Additionally, the potential for prolonged low oil and gas prices could result in reduced revenue and profitability, project delays, and impairments of assets. The company is also exposed to changes in currency values and interest rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect liquidity and financial condition. | The company faces significant economic challenges due to fluctuating prices of crude oil, natural gas, and chemicals, which are influenced by global supply and demand dynamics. High prices can reduce demand for products, particularly in the Chemicals and Products sector, leading to lower profitability. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as inflation, geopolitical tensions, and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war contribute to uncertainties in production costs and market demand. The expected economic slowdown in 2024, along with potential supply disruptions, poses further risks to revenue and profitability. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The company faces intense competition from established industry players and state-owned entities with access to financial resources. The need to differentiate services and products in commodity-type markets is critical, as failure to manage costs and operational performance could adversely affect earnings. Technological innovation is essential, and delays in developing new technologies could hinder competitive positioning. Furthermore, the company must navigate challenges in delivering capital projects, including geological uncertainties, supply chain constraints, and regulatory conditions, which could impair project delivery and the ability to replace proved oil and gas reserves. | The company is under competitive pressure from both established players and new entrants in the energy market. It faces challenges in differentiating its products in commodity-type markets, where operational performance and cost management are critical. State-owned entities with access to financial resources may have competitive advantages, particularly in bidding for new projects. The transition to a low-carbon economy also introduces risks, as changing consumer preferences and regulatory pressures could lead to reduced demand for fossil fuels, impacting the company's market position and financial performance. |
