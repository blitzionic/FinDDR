# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Shell plc's revenue has shown a consistent decline from $381,314 million in 2022 to $316,620 million in 2023, and further down to $284,312 million in 2024. Despite this revenue decrease, the gross margin improved from 32.21% in 2022 to 32.76% in 2023 and further to 33.83% in 2024, indicating better cost control or pricing power relative to cost of goods sold. Revenue by product/service reveals that Marketing remains the largest contributor, though it declined from $149,439 million in 2022 to $120,089 million in 2024. Similarly, Chemicals and Products revenue decreased from $115,541 million in 2022 to $90,918 million in 2024. Integrated Gas and Upstream revenues also declined over the period. Geographically, Europe and Asia, Oceania, Africa regions saw significant revenue drops from $135,975 million and $126,643 million in 2022 to $92,480 million and $98,343 million in 2024 respectively, while USA and Other Americas also experienced declines, reflecting broad-based regional revenue contraction. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved steadily from 6.12% in 2022 to 7.51% in 2023 and reached 9.11% in 2024, demonstrating enhanced operating efficiency despite falling revenues. Operating income increased from $23,350 million in 2022 to $23,777 million in 2023 and further to $25,907 million in 2024, even as revenue declined, indicating effective cost management. Operating expenses decreased from $39,476 million in 2022 to $39,960 million in 2023 and further to $36,917 million in 2024, supporting margin improvement. This suggests Shell successfully controlled operating costs and improved profitability at the operating level despite a challenging revenue environment. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 33.85% in 2022 to 39.82% in 2023 and further to 44.79% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability. Income tax expense decreased from $21,941 million in 2022 to $12,991 million in 2023 but rose again to $13,401 million in 2024, reflecting tax rate fluctuations relative to income. Net profit margin declined sharply from 11.24% in 2022 to 6.20% in 2023 and further to 5.81% in 2024, partly due to the rising tax burden. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Shell plc's total assets decreased to $387,609 million from $406,270 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction of approximately 4.5%. Both current assets and non-current assets declined, with current assets falling from $134,115 million to $127,926 million and non-current assets from $272,155 million to $259,683 million. Total liabilities also decreased from $217,908 million to $207,441 million, driven by reductions in both current liabilities ($95,467 million to $95,034 million) and non-current liabilities ($122,441 million to $112,407 million). Shareholders' equity declined from $188,362 million to $180,168 million, indicating a slight erosion in net worth. The current ratio decreased marginally from 140.48% to 134.61%, suggesting a slight reduction in liquidity but still maintaining a comfortable buffer above 1. The debt to equity ratio remained relatively stable, slightly improving from 115.69% to 115.14%, indicating consistent capital structure leverage. Overall, Shell's financial health in 2024 shows a modest contraction in asset base and equity, with stable leverage and adequate liquidity levels. | In 2023, Shell plc's total assets decreased to $406,270 million from $443,024 million in 2022, reflecting a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from $165,938 million to $134,115 million. Non-current assets remained relatively stable, slightly declining to $272,155 million. Total liabilities also decreased from $250,427 million to $217,908 million, with current liabilities dropping significantly from $121,311 million to $95,467 million and non-current liabilities decreasing moderately to $122,441 million. Shareholders' equity slightly declined to $188,362 million from $192,597 million, indicating a modest reduction in net worth. The current ratio improved marginally to 140.48% from 136.79%, suggesting a stable liquidity position with current assets comfortably covering current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio improved to 115.69% from 130.03%, indicating a reduction in leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, Shell maintained a solid financial health profile in 2023 with reduced leverage, stable liquidity, and a slightly smaller but still robust asset base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Shell's revenue declined by about 10.2% from $316,620 million in 2023 to $284,312 million in 2024. Despite this, gross profit only decreased by 7.2% to $96,292 million, resulting in an improved gross margin rising from 32.76% to 33.83%, indicating better cost control or product mix. Operating income increased from $23,777 million to $25,907 million, lifting the operating margin from 7.51% to 9.11%, reflecting enhanced operational profitability. However, net profit declined by 15.9% to $16,521 million, with net profit margin decreasing from 6.20% to 5.81%. This divergence is partly due to a higher effective tax rate, which rose from 39.82% to 44.79%, and a slight increase in interest expense. Return on equity decreased from 10.31% to 8.97%, and return on assets declined from 4.62% to 4.16%, indicating somewhat diminished overall earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets. The income before taxes also fell from $32,627 million to $29,922 million, consistent with the net profit trend. | Shell's revenue declined by approximately 17% to $316,620 million in 2023 from $381,314 million in 2022, reflecting lower sales across all major segments and geographic regions. Despite this, gross profit remained strong at $103,737 million, with gross margin slightly improving to 32.76% from 32.21%, indicating effective cost of goods sold management relative to revenue. Operating income increased slightly to $23,777 million from $23,350 million, improving the operating margin to 7.51% from 6.12%, showing enhanced operational profitability. However, net profit dropped sharply to $19,636 million from $42,874 million, halving the net profit margin to 6.20% from 11.24%, primarily due to higher interest expenses ($4,673 million vs. $3,181 million) and a higher effective tax rate of 39.82% compared to 33.85%. Return on equity and assets were reported at 10.31% and 4.62% respectively, indicating moderate returns on invested capital. Overall, profitability showed mixed signals with improved operational margins but significantly lower net earnings and earnings quality impacted by increased financial costs and tax burden. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, Shell maintained strong cash flow generation with net cash from operations slightly increasing from $54,191 million in 2023 to $54,687 million in 2024, despite lower revenues. Cost of goods sold decreased proportionally more than revenue, supporting improved gross margin. Operating expenses were reduced from $39,960 million to $36,917 million, contributing to higher operating income. Asset turnover declined from 74.56% to 71.63%, reflecting slightly less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Inventories were reduced from $26,019 million to $23,426 million, indicating tighter inventory management. Working capital remained relatively stable with current assets and liabilities nearly unchanged, supporting operational liquidity. Net cash used in investing activities decreased from $(17,734) million to $(15,155) million, suggesting moderated capital expenditures or asset purchases. Overall, Shell demonstrated effective cost control and stable operational cash flow, though asset utilization efficiency slightly weakened. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed some positive trends despite revenue decline. Operating expenses remained nearly flat at $39,960 million compared to $39,476 million in 2022, indicating tight cost control amid lower sales. Asset turnover was reported at 74.56%, reflecting effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased to $54,191 million from $68,414 million, consistent with lower revenue but still representing strong cash generation capacity. Inventories were reduced from $31,894 million to $26,019 million, improving working capital management. Cash flow from investing activities was negative at $(17,734) million, slightly less than the prior year, indicating continued but moderated investment spending. Financing cash outflows decreased to $(38,235) million from $(41,954) million, with dividends increasing to $8,393 million from $7,405 million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns. Overall, Shell demonstrated disciplined cost management, efficient asset use, and solid operational cash flow generation in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show a stable leverage profile with debt to equity ratio marginally improving to 115.14% from 115.69%. Interest expense increased slightly from $4,673 million to $4,787 million, but interest coverage ratio improved significantly from 508.82% to 541.19%, indicating strong ability to service debt. The current ratio decreased slightly to 134.61% but remains well above 1, suggesting low short-term liquidity risk. The effective tax rate increased notably from 39.82% to 44.79%, which could pressure net profitability and cash flows. The decline in net profit margin and return on equity may signal emerging profitability risks. The reduction in total assets and equity could also reflect some financial contraction. No significant changes in working capital or cash flow from operations suggest stable operational risk. Overall, Shell's financial risk remains moderate with strong interest coverage but watchful attention needed on tax impacts and profitability trends. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show some areas of concern but generally manageable risk. The debt to equity ratio improved to 115.69% from 130.03%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. However, interest expense increased significantly to $4,673 million from $3,181 million, which, combined with a reduced operating income, caused the interest coverage ratio to decline sharply to 508.82% from an exceptionally high 734.05%, signaling reduced but still strong ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate increased to 39.82% from 33.85%, which may pressure net profitability. Liquidity remains strong with a current ratio of 140.48%, up from 136.79%, indicating good short-term solvency. No unusual changes in working capital or cash flow suggest no immediate liquidity stress. Overall, while leverage and liquidity are stable or improving, rising interest costs and tax rates warrant monitoring as potential early warning signs. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Shell's net cash from investing activities decreased to $(15,155) million from $(17,734) million, indicating a potential moderation in investment spending which may impact future growth. Net cash from financing activities remained negative and stable at around $(38,435) million, consistent with ongoing debt repayments or shareholder returns. Dividends increased slightly from $8,393 million to $8,668 million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns and suggesting cash flow sustainability. Revenue by segment shows declines in Marketing, Chemicals and Products, and Renewables and Energy Solutions, with Renewables notably dropping from $44,819 million to $29,366 million, which may signal strategic shifts or challenges in growth areas. Geographically, revenue decreased most significantly in Europe, from $118,135 million to $92,480 million, while Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Other Americas remained relatively stable. This geographic revenue shift may influence future market focus and risk exposure. Overall, Shell appears to be managing cash flow prudently with stable dividends and moderated investments, but the decline in key growth segments and geographic revenue contraction may temper future financial performance. | Shell's investment activity in 2023, as indicated by net cash used in investing of $(17,734) million, was lower than in 2022, suggesting a cautious approach to capital expenditures. The company maintained strong operational cash flow at $54,191 million, supporting sustainable dividend payments which increased to $8,393 million, signaling confidence in cash flow sustainability and shareholder return policy. Revenue declines across all major product segments and geographic regions, including Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals, and Renewables, suggest potential challenges in top-line growth. However, improved operating margins and disciplined cost control may support profitability resilience. The reduction in leverage and stable liquidity position provide a solid financial foundation for future operations. Overall, Shell appears positioned for steady but cautious financial performance in the near term, with emphasis on cash flow generation and shareholder returns amid a challenging revenue environment. |

Construction commenced on the Shell Rotterdam Biofuels hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) facility, expected to be among the largest in Europe. Shell's Raízen biofuels joint venture in Brazil remains a leading global producer and blender of biofuels. The company expanded its electric vehicle charging network significantly, exceeding 54,000 out-of-home charge points, leveraging its global service station network to support low-carbon transport solutions. In refining, Shell made a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker at the Wesseling site in Germany into a production unit for Group III base oils, high-quality mineral base oils used in engine and transmission oils and e-fluids, targeting growing markets. Shell also deployed the AI-based T-Pulse safety monitoring system at 13 sites by year-end, enhancing real-time safety alerts. These product launches and innovations align with Shell's strategy to provide more and cleaner energy solutions and support the energy transition. |
