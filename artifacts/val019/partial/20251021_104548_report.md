# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue has shown a consistent decline over the three years, dropping from $381,314 million in 2022 to $316,620 million in 2023 (a 16.95% decrease), and further down to $284,312 million in 2024 (a 10.23% decrease from 2023). Correspondingly, the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) decreased from $258,488 million in 2022 to $212,883 million in 2023 and remained flat in 2024 at $212,883 million. Gross margin declined from 32.21% in 2022 to 32.76% in 2023, then sharply dropped to 25.12% in 2024, indicating a significant erosion in profitability at the gross profit level. By product/service, Marketing revenue decreased substantially from $149,439 million in 2022 to $108,858 million in 2023 and further to $120,089 million in 2024, showing some recovery in 2024 but still below 2022 levels. Chemicals and Products revenue increased from $115,541 million in 2022 to $118,781 million in 2023 but then declined sharply to $90,918 million in 2024. Renewables and Energy Solutions revenue steadily declined from $53,190 million in 2022 to $44,819 million in 2023 and further to $29,366 million in 2024, indicating reduced focus or demand in this segment. Integrated Gas and Upstream revenues also declined consistently over the period. Geographically, revenue from Europe dropped significantly from $135,975 million in 2022 to $118,135 million in 2023 and further to $92,480 million in 2024. Asia, Oceania, and Africa revenues decreased from $126,643 million in 2022 to $99,967 million in 2023 and slightly to $98,343 million in 2024. USA revenue declined from $87,085 million in 2022 to $70,291 million in 2023 and then to $65,089 million in 2024. Other Americas revenue remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease from $31,611 million in 2022 to $28,227 million in 2023 and $28,400 million in 2024. Overall, the company is experiencing broad-based revenue declines across most products and regions, with gross margin compression particularly pronounced in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses remained relatively stable, with $39,476 million in 2022, increasing slightly to $39,960 million in 2023, then decreasing to $36,917 million in 2024, indicating some cost control efforts in 2024. However, the operating margin data is not provided, but given the revenue decline and gross margin compression, operating income likely deteriorated. The net profit margin declined from 11.24% in 2022 to 6.20% in 2023 and further to 5.81% in 2024, reflecting reduced profitability despite relatively stable operating expenses. The relationship between operating income and revenue suggests deteriorating operational efficiency, as revenue fell by 25.43% from 2022 to 2024, but net profit fell by 61.45% over the same period, indicating that cost management has not fully offset revenue declines. The slight reduction in operating expenses in 2024 may have helped limit further margin erosion, but overall operating efficiency appears to have weakened. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed a significant decline from 33.85% in 2022 to 39.82% in 2023, then plummeted to 0.01% in 2024. This drastic reduction in tax expense in 2024 (income tax expense of -$1 million) compared to $12,991 million in 2023 and $21,941 million in 2022 suggests the presence of non-recurring tax benefits or adjustments in 2024, which positively impacted net profit despite declining operational performance. No other explicit non-recurring items are noted in the data. External factors such as broad revenue declines across regions and product lines may reflect market or economic challenges impacting profitability. The sharp drop in tax expense in 2024 partially cushioned the net profit decline, indicating that external or one-off tax-related factors played a significant role in the company's bottom-line results for that year. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company experienced a slight decline in total assets to $387,609 million from $406,270 million in 2023, indicating a contraction in asset base. Both current assets and non-current assets decreased, with current assets falling from $134,115 million to $127,926 million and non-current assets from $272,155 million to $259,683 million. Total liabilities also decreased from $217,908 million to $207,441 million, reflecting some liability management and reduction. Current liabilities remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from $95,467 million to $95,034 million, while non-current liabilities dropped more significantly from $122,441 million to $112,407 million. Shareholders' equity declined from $188,362 million to $180,168 million, and retained earnings decreased from $165,915 million to $158,834 million, indicating some erosion in equity base. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, decreased from 140.48% to 134.61%, suggesting a modest reduction in short-term liquidity but still above 1.3x, which is generally acceptable. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 115%, indicating consistent leverage levels. Overall, the financial position shows a slight contraction in asset size and equity, with stable but slightly reduced liquidity and maintained leverage, reflecting moderate balance sheet strength with cautious liability management in 2024. | In 2023, the company experienced a decline in total assets to $406,270 million from $443,024 million in 2022, indicating a contraction in asset base. Current assets decreased notably from $165,938 million to $134,115 million, while non-current assets slightly declined from $277,086 million to $272,155 million. Total liabilities also reduced from $250,427 million to $217,908 million, with current liabilities dropping from $121,311 million to $95,467 million and non-current liabilities from $129,116 million to $122,441 million. Shareholders' equity decreased marginally from $192,597 million to $188,362 million, reflecting a slight erosion in net worth. The current ratio improved from 136.79% to 140.48%, suggesting enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved from 130.03% to 115.69%, indicating better leverage management and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company maintained a solid financial position with reduced liabilities and improved liquidity, despite a contraction in asset size and equity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined notably by about 10.2% from $316,620 million in 2023 to $284,312 million in 2024. Cost of goods sold remained flat at $212,883 million, which contributed to a significant drop in gross margin from 32.76% in 2023 to 25.12% in 2024, indicating margin compression likely due to lower revenue without corresponding cost reductions. Operating expenses decreased from $39,960 million to $36,917 million, showing some cost control efforts. Net profit declined by 15.9% from $19,636 million to $16,521 million, with net profit margin slightly decreasing from 6.20% to 5.81%, reflecting reduced profitability. Income before taxes dropped sharply from $32,627 million to $18,492 million, while income tax expense turned negative (-$1 million) from a positive $12,991 million, resulting in an effective tax rate near zero (0.01%) compared to 39.82% in 2023, which may indicate tax benefits or adjustments impacting earnings quality. Return on equity decreased from 10.31% to 8.97%, and return on assets declined from 4.62% to 4.16%, both signaling lower returns on invested capital and assets. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 with lower revenue, compressed margins, and reduced returns, though tax effects partially cushioned net income decline. | Revenue declined significantly by approximately 17% from $381,314 million in 2022 to $316,620 million in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased proportionally from $258,488 million to $212,883 million, resulting in a slight improvement in gross margin from 32.21% to 32.76%. Operating expenses remained relatively stable, increasing marginally from $39,476 million to $39,960 million. Net profit dropped sharply by more than half from $42,874 million to $19,636 million, causing net profit margin to fall from 11.24% to 6.20%. Income before taxes also declined from $64,815 million to $32,627 million. The effective tax rate increased from 33.85% to 39.82%, further compressing net earnings. Return on equity was 10.31% and return on assets was 4.62%, indicating moderate profitability and earnings sustainability despite the revenue and net profit decline. Overall, profitability weakened substantially in 2023, driven by lower revenues and higher tax burden, although gross margin held steady. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating margin data is unavailable, but cost control is evident with operating expenses reduced by 7.6% from $39,960 million to $36,917 million despite lower revenue. Asset turnover decreased from 74.56% to 71.63%, indicating slightly less efficient use of assets to generate sales. Inventories declined from $26,019 million to $23,426 million, suggesting improved inventory management or reduced stock levels. Net cash from operations increased marginally from $54,191 million to $54,687 million, demonstrating stable cash generation despite lower revenue and profits. Working capital, inferred from current assets and liabilities, slightly decreased, consistent with the current ratio decline. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: improved cost control and stable cash flow from operations, but slightly reduced asset utilization and working capital efficiency in 2024. | Operating expenses were well controlled, increasing only slightly from $39,476 million to $39,960 million despite the revenue decline. The asset turnover ratio was strong at 74.56%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased from $68,414 million in 2022 to $54,191 million in 2023, reflecting lower cash generation consistent with reduced profitability. Working capital decreased as current assets fell more than current liabilities, but the current ratio improved, suggesting maintained liquidity. Inventories were reduced from $31,894 million to $26,019 million, indicating better inventory management or lower stock levels. Overall, the company demonstrated reasonable cost control and asset utilization, though cash flow from operations declined in line with lower earnings. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remained stable with a debt to equity ratio of approximately 115.14%, nearly unchanged from 115.69% in 2023, indicating consistent reliance on debt financing. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, decreased from 140.48% to 134.61%, still indicating adequate short-term liquidity but with a slight weakening. Interest expense increased slightly from $4,673 million to $4,787 million, which could pressure earnings given the lower income before taxes. Interest coverage ratio is unavailable, limiting assessment of the ability to cover interest costs. The effective tax rate dropped dramatically to near zero, which may reflect tax planning or one-time tax benefits but could also signal volatility in tax obligations. The negative income tax expense in 2024 is an unusual risk factor. Overall, financial risk is moderate with stable leverage and liquidity but potential concerns from increased interest expense and unusual tax expense behavior. | Leverage improved as debt to equity ratio decreased from 130.03% to 115.69%, reducing financial risk. The current ratio increased to 140.48%, indicating strong liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense rose from $3,181 million to $4,673 million, which could pressure interest coverage, though exact coverage ratios are unavailable. The effective tax rate increased significantly to 39.82%, which may indicate higher tax risk or reduced tax efficiency. The decline in net profit and cash flow from operations alongside increased interest expense suggests some emerging financial risks related to earnings sustainability and debt servicing. However, the overall balance sheet improvements mitigate immediate solvency concerns. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities, as reflected by net cash from investing, show a reduced outflow from $(17,734) million in 2023 to $(15,155) million in 2024, indicating slightly lower capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing remained a negative outflow, increasing slightly from $(38,235) million to $(38,435) million, consistent with ongoing debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends increased from $8,393 million to $8,668 million, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings. Revenue by product shows mixed trends: Marketing revenue increased from $108,858 million to $120,089 million, and Upstream revenue rose slightly, while Chemicals and Products and Renewables and Energy Solutions revenues declined significantly, indicating potential shifts in business segment performance. Geographically, revenue declined notably in Europe and the USA but remained stable in Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Other Americas, suggesting regional market challenges in Europe and the USA. The stable net cash from operations and increased dividends imply cash flow sustainability, but the revenue declines and margin compression may pressure future profitability. Overall, the company appears to be managing investments and shareholder returns prudently but faces challenges in growth and segment/geographic revenue trends that may impact future financial performance. | Investment activities showed a reduction in net cash used in investing from $(22,448) million in 2022 to $(17,734) million in 2023, indicating a potential slowdown in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities also decreased in outflow from $(41,954) million to $(38,235) million, with dividends increasing from $7,405 million to $8,393 million, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings. Revenue by product shows declines in Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, and Renewables and Energy Solutions segments, while Chemicals and Products revenue increased slightly, indicating mixed segment performance. Geographically, revenue declined across all regions, with Europe and Asia, Oceania, Africa showing the largest decreases. The decline in cash and net cash from operations, combined with reduced investing outflows, suggests cautious growth outlook. Dividend policy appears stable or slightly more generous, implying confidence in cash flow sustainability. Overall, future performance may face challenges from declining revenues and cash flows, but stable dividends and selective investment may support moderate growth. |
