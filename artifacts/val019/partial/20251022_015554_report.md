# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue has shown a consistent decline over the three years, dropping from $381,314m in 2022 to $316,620m in 2023 (a 16.95% decrease), and further to $284,312m in 2024 (a 10.23% decrease from 2023). Despite this, gross margin improved steadily from 32.21% in 2022 to 32.76% in 2023 and 33.83% in 2024, indicating better cost control or pricing power relative to cost of goods sold, which also decreased from $258,488m in 2022 to $212,883m in 2023 and $188,120m in 2024. Revenue by product/service reveals significant shifts: Integrated Gas revenue declined sharply from $54,751m in 2022 to $37,290m in 2024, a 31.9% drop; Upstream also fell from $8,352m to $6,606m (20.9% decline). Marketing revenue decreased from $149,439m to $120,089m (19.6% decline), Chemicals and Products showed a slight decrease from $115,541m in 2022 to $90,918m in 2024 (21.3% decline), while Renewables and Energy Solutions revenue dropped from $53,190m to $29,366m (44.8% decline). Corporate revenue remained negligible. Geographically, Europe revenue declined from $135,975m in 2022 to $92,480m in 2024 (31.9% decrease), Asia, Oceania, Africa dropped from $126,643m to $98,343m (22.3% decrease), USA revenue fell from $87,085m to $65,089m (25.3% decrease), and Other Americas remained relatively stable with a slight decrease from $31,611m to $28,400m (10.2% decrease). These trends suggest broad-based revenue contraction across products and regions, with Renewables and Energy Solutions and Europe experiencing the steepest declines. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin remained relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend, from 21.86% in 2022 to 20.14% in 2023 and 20.88% in 2024. Operating income decreased from $83,350m in 2022 to $63,777m in 2023 (a 23.5% decline) and further to $59,375m in 2024 (a 6.9% decline from 2023), reflecting the revenue contraction. Operating expenses were fairly consistent, slightly increasing from $39,476m in 2022 to $39,960m in 2023, then decreasing to $36,917m in 2024, indicating some cost management efforts. The ratio of operating income to revenue remained around 20%, showing that despite revenue declines, the company maintained operational efficiency and controlled costs effectively. However, the absolute operating income decline signals pressure on profitability from lower sales volumes or prices. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 33.85% in 2022 to 39.82% in 2023 and further to 44.79% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability. Income tax expense decreased from $21,941m in 2022 to $12,991m in 2023 but rose slightly to $13,401m in 2024 despite lower pre-tax income, reflecting the higher tax rate. Net profit margin halved from 11.24% in 2022 to 6.20% in 2023 and further to 5.81% in 2024, with net profit dropping from $42,874m to $19,636m and then $16,521m. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the data provided. External factors such as increased tax burden and broad revenue declines across all segments and regions likely contributed to the reduced profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company experienced a decline in total assets to $387,609 million from $406,270 million in 2023, indicating a contraction in asset base. Both current assets and non-current assets decreased, with current assets falling from $134,115 million to $127,926 million and non-current assets from $272,155 million to $259,683 million. Total liabilities also decreased from $217,908 million to $207,441 million, reflecting some liability management and reduction. Current liabilities remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from $95,467 million to $95,034 million, while non-current liabilities declined more significantly from $122,441 million to $112,407 million. Shareholders' equity decreased from $188,362 million to $180,168 million, and retained earnings also declined from $165,915 million to $158,834 million, indicating some erosion in equity base. The current ratio decreased from 140.48% to 134.61%, suggesting a slight reduction in liquidity but still maintaining a comfortable short-term liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio remained almost stable, slightly improving from 115.69% to 115.14%, indicating consistent leverage levels. Overall, the company shows a somewhat reduced but still solid financial position with controlled liabilities and a strong equity base, though asset contraction and equity decline warrant monitoring. | In 2023, the company experienced a decline in total assets to $406,270 million from $443,024 million in 2022, indicating a contraction in asset base. Current assets decreased notably from $165,938 million to $134,115 million, while non-current assets slightly declined from $277,086 million to $272,155 million. Total liabilities also reduced from $250,427 million to $217,908 million, with current liabilities dropping from $121,311 million to $95,467 million and non-current liabilities from $129,116 million to $122,441 million. Shareholders' equity decreased marginally from $192,597 million to $188,362 million, reflecting a slight erosion in net worth. The current ratio improved slightly to 140.48% from 136.79%, indicating a modest enhancement in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved to 115.69% from 130.03%, suggesting better leverage management and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company maintained a solid financial position with reduced liabilities and stable equity, though asset contraction signals cautious asset management or divestitures in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined by approximately 10.2% from $316,620 million in 2023 to $284,312 million in 2024. Gross profit decreased from $103,737 million to $96,292 million, but the gross margin improved from 32.76% to 33.83%, indicating better cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. Operating income fell from $63,777 million to $59,375 million, with operating margin slightly improving from 20.14% to 20.88%, reflecting effective operating expense management as operating expenses decreased from $39,960 million to $36,917 million. Net profit declined from $19,636 million to $16,521 million, and net profit margin decreased from 6.20% to 5.81%, indicating some pressure on bottom-line profitability. Return on equity dropped from 10.31% to 8.97%, and return on assets declined from 4.62% to 4.16%, signaling reduced earnings efficiency and sustainability. The effective tax rate increased significantly from 39.82% to 44.79%, which negatively impacted net profitability. Overall, while margins at gross and operating levels improved slightly, net profitability and returns weakened due to lower revenue, higher tax burden, and reduced net income. | Revenue declined significantly by approximately 17% from $381,314 million in 2022 to $316,620 million in 2023. Gross profit decreased from $122,826 million to $103,737 million, but the gross margin slightly improved to 32.76% from 32.21%, indicating better cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. Operating income fell sharply from $83,350 million to $63,777 million, with operating margin declining to 20.14% from 21.86%. Net profit dropped substantially by more than half from $42,874 million to $19,636 million, and net profit margin halved to 6.20% from 11.24%, reflecting significant pressure on bottom-line profitability. Return on equity was 10.31% and return on assets 4.62%, with no prior year data for comparison, indicating moderate returns on invested capital. The effective tax rate increased to 39.82% from 33.85%, which negatively impacted net earnings. Overall, profitability weakened considerably in 2023 with lower revenues and profits, despite slight margin improvements at the gross level, and higher tax burden reduced earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | The company demonstrated improved cost control with operating expenses decreasing by 7.6% from $39,960 million to $36,917 million, contributing to a higher operating margin of 20.88% in 2024 compared to 20.14% in 2023. Asset turnover declined from 74.56% to 71.63%, indicating slightly less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased marginally from $54,191 million to $54,687 million, showing stable cash generation despite lower revenue. Inventories decreased from $26,019 million to $23,426 million, suggesting better inventory management or reduced stock levels. Working capital, inferred from current assets and liabilities, slightly contracted as current assets decreased more than current liabilities, consistent with the slight drop in current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency improved in cost control and cash flow generation, but asset utilization showed a minor decline. | Operating expenses remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $39,476 million to $39,960 million despite the revenue decline, which contributed to the reduced operating margin. Asset turnover was 74.56%, indicating the company generated $0.7456 in revenue for every dollar of assets, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations decreased from $68,414 million to $54,191 million, reflecting lower cash generation aligned with reduced profitability. Inventories declined from $31,894 million to $26,019 million, suggesting improved inventory management or reduced stock levels. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supported by a higher current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency showed mixed results with stable cost control but lower cash flow generation and asset utilization reflecting the revenue contraction. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remained stable with the debt to equity ratio nearly unchanged at 115.14% in 2024 compared to 115.69% in 2023, indicating consistent reliance on debt financing. Interest expense slightly increased from $4,673 million to $4,787 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased from 1364.80% to 1240.34%, reflecting a modest reduction in the company's ability to cover interest expenses from operating income but still at a very comfortable level. The effective tax rate rose sharply from 39.82% to 44.79%, increasing tax-related risk and reducing net profitability. Liquidity indicators showed a slight decline with the current ratio falling from 140.48% to 134.61%, but liquidity remains strong. No significant increase in short-term liabilities was observed. Overall, financial risk remains moderate with stable leverage and strong interest coverage, but the higher tax rate and slight liquidity reduction warrant attention. | Leverage improved as debt to equity ratio decreased to 115.69% from 130.03%, indicating reduced reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased from $3,181 million to $4,673 million, which, combined with lower operating income, caused interest coverage to decline sharply to 1364.80% from an exceptionally high 2620.25%, signaling reduced but still strong ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate rose to 39.82% from 33.85%, increasing tax-related risk and reducing net income. Liquidity remained solid with a current ratio above 1.4, indicating good short-term solvency. No significant early warning signs of financial distress are evident, but the decline in profitability and cash flow, along with increased interest expense, warrant monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities showed a reduction in net cash used for investing from $(17,734) million in 2023 to $(15,155) million in 2024, indicating a potential moderation in capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from operations remained stable, supporting cash flow sustainability. Dividends increased from $8,393 million to $8,668 million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower net income. Revenue by product segment reveals mixed trends: Marketing revenue increased from $108,858 million to $120,089 million, and Upstream slightly increased from $6,475 million to $6,606 million, while Chemicals and Products and Renewables and Energy Solutions saw significant declines, suggesting shifting business dynamics and potential areas for strategic focus. Geographically, revenue declined notably in Europe from $118,135 million to $92,480 million and in the USA from $70,291 million to $65,089 million, while Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Other Americas remained relatively stable. These trends suggest future performance may depend on growth in Marketing and Upstream segments and geographic diversification. Overall, the company appears to maintain cash flow and dividend policies while adjusting investment levels and facing mixed segment and regional revenue trends. | Investment activities showed a net cash outflow from investing of $17,734 million, slightly lower than $22,448 million in 2022, indicating continued but moderated capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from financing was negative $38,235 million, down from $41,954 million, reflecting ongoing debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends increased to $8,393 million from $7,405 million, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings. Revenue by product shows declines in Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, and Renewables segments, while Chemicals and Products revenue increased slightly, indicating potential growth focus areas. Geographically, revenue decreased across all regions, with Europe and Asia, Oceania, Africa showing the largest declines, signaling possible market challenges. Cash flow sustainability is pressured by lower operational cash inflows and higher dividend payouts. The company may need to balance investment and dividend policies carefully while focusing on growth segments to improve future performance. |
