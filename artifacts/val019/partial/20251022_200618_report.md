# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Shell plc's revenue has shown a declining trend from 2022 to 2024, decreasing from $381,314 million in 2022 to $316,620 million in 2023, and further to $284,312 million in 2024. Despite this decline, the gross margin improved steadily from 32.21% in 2022 to 32.76% in 2023 and 33.83% in 2024, indicating better cost control or pricing power relative to cost of goods sold, which also decreased from $258,488 million in 2022 to $188,120 million in 2024. By product/service, Marketing remains the largest revenue contributor but declined from $149,439 million in 2022 to $120,089 million in 2024. Chemicals and Products also decreased from $115,541 million to $90,918 million over the same period. Renewables and Energy Solutions revenue dropped from $53,190 million in 2022 to $29,366 million in 2024, showing a significant contraction. Geographically, Europe and Asia, Oceania, Africa regions saw notable revenue declines from $135,975 million to $92,480 million and $126,643 million to $98,343 million respectively between 2022 and 2024, while USA and Other Americas also experienced decreases, reflecting broad-based regional revenue contraction. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 17.00% in 2022 to 10.30% in 2023 and slightly improved to 10.52% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating profitability relative to revenue. Operating income dropped sharply from $64,815 million in 2022 to $32,627 million in 2023 and further to $29,922 million in 2024, while operating expenses remained relatively stable around $39,476 million in 2022 and $36,417 million in 2024, indicating some cost containment but insufficient to offset revenue declines. The ratio of operating income to revenue weakened, signaling pressure on operational efficiency. Cost management shows moderate improvement in operating expenses but the steep revenue decline has outpaced cost reductions, leading to margin compression. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased markedly from 33.85% in 2022 to 39.82% in 2023 and further to 44.79% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability. Income tax expense decreased from $21,941 million in 2022 to $13,401 million in 2024 but at a higher tax rate relative to income before tax, contributing to a decline in net profit margin from 11.24% in 2022 to 5.81% in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Shell plc's total assets decreased to $387,609 million from $406,270 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction in asset base by approximately 4.5%. Both current assets and non-current assets declined, with current assets falling from $134,115 million to $127,926 million and non-current assets from $272,155 million to $259,683 million. Total liabilities also decreased from $217,908 million to $207,441 million, driven by reductions in both current liabilities ($95,160 million to $88,831 million) and non-current liabilities ($122,441 million to $112,407 million). Shareholders' equity declined from $186,607 million to $178,307 million, indicating a slight erosion in net worth. The current ratio improved marginally from 140.94% to 144.01%, suggesting a stable and slightly enhanced liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio remained relatively stable, slightly improving from 116.77% to 116.34%, indicating consistent capital structure leverage. Overall, Shell maintains a solid financial health profile with a balanced capital structure and adequate liquidity, despite a modest contraction in asset base and equity. | In 2023, Shell plc's total assets decreased to $406,270 million from $443,024 million in 2022, reflecting a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from $163,087 million to $134,115 million. Non-current assets saw a slight decline to $272,155 million. Total liabilities remained stable at $217,908 million, with current liabilities steady at $95,160 million and non-current liabilities unchanged at $122,441 million. Shareholders' equity slightly decreased to $186,607 million from $190,472 million, indicating a modest erosion in net worth. The current ratio declined from 171.38% to 140.94%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity but still above 1, suggesting adequate coverage of current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio increased marginally to 116.77% from 114.40%, indicating a slight increase in leverage. Overall, Shell maintains a solid capital structure with manageable liabilities, though asset contraction and reduced liquidity warrant monitoring. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Shell's revenue decreased by about 10.2% from $316,620 million in 2023 to $284,312 million in 2024. Despite this, gross profit only declined by 7.1% to $96,392 million, resulting in an improved gross margin from 32.76% to 33.83%, indicating better cost control or product mix. Operating income fell by 8.3% to $29,922 million, with operating margin slightly improving from 10.30% to 10.52%. Net profit decreased by 15.9% to $16,521 million, and net profit margin declined from 6.20% to 5.81%, reflecting pressure on bottom-line profitability. Return on equity dropped from 10.41% to 9.05%, and return on assets decreased from 4.62% to 4.16%, signaling reduced efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased significantly from 39.82% to 44.79%, which negatively impacted net earnings. Overall, profitability weakened in absolute terms but showed some margin resilience at the gross and operating levels, with earnings quality affected by higher tax burden and lower net margins. | Shell's revenue declined significantly by approximately 17% to $316,620 million in 2023 from $381,314 million in 2022. Gross profit decreased to $103,737 million from $122,826 million, but the gross margin slightly improved to 32.76% from 32.21%, indicating stable cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income halved to $32,627 million from $64,815 million, causing the operating margin to drop sharply from 17.00% to 10.30%. Net profit also declined by more than half to $19,636 million from $42,874 million, with net profit margin falling to 6.20% from 11.24%. The effective tax rate increased notably to 39.82% from 33.85%, impacting net earnings. Return on equity and assets for 2023 are 10.41% and 4.62%, respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and asset base. Overall, profitability weakened substantially in 2023, with margins compressed and earnings halved, reflecting challenging market or operational conditions. |
| Operational efficiency | Shell demonstrated effective cost control in 2024, with cost of goods sold decreasing by 11.6% to $188,120 million, outpacing the revenue decline. Operating expenses also reduced by 8.9% to $36,417 million. Asset turnover declined from 74.56% to 71.63%, indicating slightly less efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories decreased from $26,019 million to $23,426 million, reflecting tighter inventory management. Net cash from operations increased marginally from $54,191 million to $54,687 million, showing stable operational cash generation despite lower revenues. Working capital improved slightly as current assets and current liabilities both decreased, with current ratio improving to 144.01%. Cash flow from investing activities showed reduced outflows, improving from $(17,734) million to $(15,155) million, indicating moderated investment spending. Cash flow from financing remained consistent with a slight increase in outflows. Overall, operational efficiency remained solid with good cost discipline, stable cash flow generation, and improved working capital management. | Operating expenses remained relatively stable at $39,960 million compared to $39,476 million in 2022, despite the revenue decline, suggesting limited cost reduction efforts. Asset turnover was high at 74.56%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Inventories decreased from $31,894 million to $26,019 million, reflecting tighter inventory management or lower production. Net cash from operations declined to $54,191 million from $68,414 million, consistent with lower profitability and revenue. Cash flow from investing activities improved slightly with reduced outflows of $17,734 million versus $22,448 million, indicating moderated capital expenditure or asset purchases. Financing cash outflows decreased to $38,235 million from $41,954 million, with dividends paid increasing to $8,393 million from $7,405 million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite earnings pressure. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: strong asset utilization but constrained cash generation and stable operating costs amid revenue decline. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remained stable with debt to equity ratio marginally improving to 116.34% from 116.77%, indicating no significant increase in financial risk from leverage. Liquidity improved slightly as evidenced by the current ratio rising to 144.01%. Interest expense increased slightly from $4,673 million to $4,787 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased from 698.20% to 625.07%, still indicating a very strong ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased notably from 39.82% to 44.79%, which could signal higher tax risk or changes in tax environment impacting net profitability. The decline in net profit margin and returns on equity and assets may also be early warning signs of margin pressure. No significant changes in cash flow from operations or financing suggest stable financial risk profile. Overall, Shell's financial risk remains well-managed with strong liquidity and coverage ratios, though the rising tax rate and margin compression warrant monitoring. | Leverage increased slightly as indicated by the debt to equity ratio rising to 116.77% from 114.40%, suggesting marginally higher financial risk. The current ratio decreased to 140.94% from 171.38%, indicating reduced liquidity but still a comfortable buffer over 1. Interest expense increased to $4,673 million from $3,181 million, while interest coverage ratio dropped significantly to 698.20% from an exceptionally high 2037.57%, reflecting reduced earnings buffer to cover interest costs. The effective tax rate rose to 39.82% from 33.85%, which could pressure net income and cash flows. The decline in net profit and operating income alongside increased interest expense and reduced liquidity signals elevated financial risk, though the company remains well-capitalized. Monitoring interest costs and liquidity will be important to preempt potential stress. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity moderated in 2024 with net cash used in investing decreasing to $(15,155) million from $(17,734) million in 2023, suggesting a cautious approach to capital expenditures. Net cash from operations remained stable, supporting sustainable cash flow generation. Dividend payments increased slightly from $(8,393) million to $(8,668) million, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower net profits. Revenue by segment shows declines in Marketing (from $130,559 million to $120,089 million), Chemicals and Products (from $97,080 million to $90,918 million), and Renewables and Energy Solutions (from $44,819 million to $29,366 million), with Integrated Gas and Upstream segments relatively stable. Geographic revenue shows a significant decline in Europe (from $118,135 million to $92,480 million), while Asia, Oceania, Africa and Other Americas remained stable, and USA revenue declined moderately. These trends suggest potential challenges in traditional markets and renewables, with possible strategic focus needed on geographic and segment diversification. Overall, Shell's future financial performance will depend on managing margin pressures, sustaining cash flow, and navigating shifting segment and regional dynamics while maintaining disciplined investment and dividend policies. | Shell's net cash from investing activities decreased in outflow to $17,734 million from $22,448 million, indicating a potential moderation in capital expenditure or asset acquisitions, which may impact future growth. The company maintained substantial dividend payments, increasing to $8,393 million from $7,405 million, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns and confidence in cash flow sustainability despite lower earnings. Revenue declines were broad-based across product segments and geographies, with notable decreases in Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals, and Renewables revenues, and across Europe, Asia/Oceania/Africa, USA, and Other Americas regions. This widespread contraction may signal challenges ahead. However, stable operating expenses and strong asset turnover imply operational resilience. Future performance will depend on market recovery, cost control, and investment effectiveness. The company’s moderate leverage and liquidity position provide some buffer to navigate uncertainties. |
