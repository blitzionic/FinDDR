# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue showed a decline from 2023 to 2024, dropping from £26,458m to £19,913m, a decrease of approximately 24.7%, after growing 11.4% from 2022 (£23,741m) to 2023. Gross profit also fell sharply from £9,623m in 2023 to £4,087m in 2024, a 57.5% decrease, despite a prior increase from £2,045m in 2022 to £9,623m in 2023. Gross margin percentages were unusually high and volatile, with 153.20% in 2022, peaking at 138.49% in 2023, then rising again to 156.77% in 2024, indicating possible data anomalies or accounting adjustments. Revenue by product/service reveals significant shifts: British Gas Energy revenue dropped from £17,742m in 2023 to £12,065m in 2024 (-32%), Centrica Energy halved from £7,256m to £5,723m (-21%), and Centrica Business Solutions declined by 27.6% from £3,516m to £2,543m. Conversely, Upstream revenue increased from £1,505m in 2023 to £1,607m in 2024 (+6.7%), and Bord Gáis Energy decreased by 29.9% from £1,815m to £1,271m. Geographically, UK revenue dropped significantly by 26.9% from £22,207m in 2023 to £16,240m in 2024, Republic of Ireland revenue decreased by 28.9% to £1,021m, and Europe (excluding UK and Ireland) declined by 17.9% to £1,423m. Rest of the world revenue increased by 13.8% from £1,080m to £1,229m, indicating some geographic diversification despite overall revenue contraction. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin deteriorated markedly from 24.61% in 2023 to 8.55% in 2024, after recovering from a negative margin of (1.01%) in 2022. Operating income fell sharply by 73.9% from £6,512m in 2023 to £1,703m in 2024, reflecting the revenue decline and possibly higher operating expenses relative to revenue. Operating expenses decreased from £3,319m in 2023 to £2,640m in 2024 (-20.4%), showing some cost management efforts; however, the reduction in operating income was disproportionate to the expense savings, indicating inefficiencies or margin pressure. The operating income to revenue ratio confirms this, dropping from 24.61% to 8.55%, signaling reduced operational profitability and efficiency. The negative operating income in 2022 (-£240m) improved substantially in 2023 but was not sustained in 2024, suggesting volatility in operational performance possibly linked to market or internal factors. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate improved significantly from a high positive 66.06% in 2022 to negative rates of (37.59%) in 2023 and (18.70%) in 2024, indicating tax credits or benefits that positively impacted net profitability in the latter years. Income tax expense dropped from £2,433m in 2023 to £314m in 2024, consistent with the lower tax rate and reduced pre-tax income. Net profit margin followed operating margin trends, falling from 15.27% in 2023 to 6.85% in 2024, after a negative margin in 2022 (-2.68%). The presence of negative tax rates and large swings in tax expense suggest non-recurring tax benefits or adjustments. No explicit non-recurring items are detailed, but the volatility in tax and margins implies external factors such as regulatory changes, market conditions, or one-off tax settlements materially affected profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company experienced a contraction in total assets, declining from £21,366m in 2023 to £18,733m, indicating a reduction in asset base by approximately 12.3%. Both current and non-current assets decreased, with current assets falling from £16,066m to £14,144m and non-current assets from £5,300m to £4,589m. Total liabilities also decreased significantly from £17,133m to £13,921m, reflecting improved liability management and a reduction in financial obligations. Current liabilities dropped from £11,136m to £8,902m, and non-current liabilities from £5,997m to £5,019m. Shareholders' equity strengthened, rising from £3,877m to £4,422m, supported by an increase in retained earnings from £3,274m to £3,979m, indicating enhanced net asset value and capital base. The current ratio improved from 144.27% to 158.89%, suggesting better short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved markedly from 441.91% to 314.81%, reflecting a more balanced capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the financial position in 2024 shows a stronger equity base, reduced liabilities, and improved liquidity despite a smaller asset base. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a stronger financial position compared to 2022. Total assets decreased from £29,038m to £21,366m, driven by reductions in both current assets (£20,688m to £16,066m) and non-current assets (£8,350m to £5,300m). Despite the asset contraction, total liabilities significantly declined from £27,758m to £17,133m, with current liabilities nearly halving from £21,711m to £11,136m and non-current liabilities remaining relatively stable. This liability reduction contributed to a substantial increase in shareholders' equity from £1,017m to £3,877m and a reversal of retained earnings from a deficit of £466m to a positive £3,274m. Liquidity improved markedly, as reflected by the current ratio rising from 95.29% to 144.27%, indicating enhanced short-term financial stability. The debt to equity ratio improved dramatically from 2,729.40% to 441.91%, signaling better capital structure management and reduced leverage risk. Overall, the balance sheet strength improved with better equity positioning and lower liabilities, despite asset shrinkage. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined sharply by 24.7% from £26,458m in 2023 to £19,913m in 2024, driven by decreases across most product lines and geographic regions. Gross profit dropped significantly from £9,623m to £4,087m, reflecting higher cost of goods sold (£11,304m in 2024 vs £10,185m in 2023). Despite the gross margin increasing from 138.49% to 156.77%, operating income fell drastically from £6,512m to £1,703m, and net profit declined from £4,040m to £1,365m. Operating margin compressed from 24.61% to 8.55%, and net profit margin halved from 15.27% to 6.85%, indicating margin pressure and reduced earnings quality. Return on equity dropped sharply from 165.10% to 32.90%, and return on assets declined from 16.03% to 6.81%, signaling lower profitability and less efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate decreased substantially from 37.59% to 18.70%, which partially cushioned net income. Overall, profitability weakened significantly in 2024 with lower revenues and profits, compressed margins, and reduced returns, raising concerns about earnings sustainability. | The company showed a remarkable turnaround in profitability in 2023. Revenue increased by approximately 11.4% from £23,741m in 2022 to £26,458m in 2023. Gross profit surged from £2,045m to £9,623m, although the gross margin decreased from 153.20% to 138.49%, indicating some cost structure changes or revenue mix effects. Operating income improved dramatically from a loss of £240m to a profit of £6,512m, with operating margin rising from negative 1.01% to a strong 24.61%. Net profit swung from a loss of £636m to a substantial profit of £4,040m, lifting the net profit margin from negative 2.68% to 15.27%. Return on equity was robust at 165.10%, and return on assets was 16.03%, both indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of capital. The effective tax rate shifted from a high 66.06% in 2022 to a negative 37.59% in 2023, suggesting tax benefits or adjustments that enhanced net profitability. Overall, earnings sustainability appears strong given the significant profit recovery and improved margins. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses decreased from £3,319m to £2,640m, reflecting some cost control efforts, but the operating margin still declined sharply to 8.55% from 24.61%. Asset turnover slightly decreased from 104.98% to 99.32%, indicating a marginal decline in asset utilization efficiency. Net cash from operations dropped substantially from £2,752m to £1,149m, highlighting weaker cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased from £1,079m to £904m, which may indicate tighter inventory management or reduced sales volume. Working capital improved as current assets and current liabilities both declined, but the current ratio increased, suggesting better short-term liquidity management. Overall, operational efficiency weakened in 2024 due to lower cash flow generation and reduced asset turnover, despite some cost containment. | Operational efficiency improved significantly in 2023. Operating expenses increased from £2,378m to £3,319m, but this was more than offset by the substantial increase in gross profit, resulting in a positive operating income of £6,512m. The operating margin improved from negative 1.01% to 24.61%, reflecting better cost control relative to revenue. Asset turnover was very high at 104.98%, indicating excellent utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations more than doubled from £1,314m to £2,752m, supporting strong cash generation capacity. Inventories decreased slightly from £1,269m to £1,079m, which may indicate improved inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets and current liabilities both decreased, but the current ratio increase suggests better liquidity management. Overall, the company enhanced operational efficiency through improved margins, asset utilization, and cash flow generation. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage decreased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio improving from 441.91% to 314.81%, reducing financial risk. Interest expense increased slightly from £308m to £337m, but interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 505.34%, down from an exceptionally high 2,114.29% in 2023, indicating the company still comfortably covers interest obligations. The effective tax rate dropped significantly from 37.59% to 18.70%, which may reflect changes in tax strategy or jurisdictional impacts, potentially affecting future tax liabilities. Liquidity improved with the current ratio rising to 158.89% from 144.27%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. However, the sharp decline in net cash from operations and net profit margins signals potential earnings volatility risk. Overall, financial risk has moderated with lower leverage and strong interest coverage, but profitability and cash flow declines warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators improved markedly in 2023. The debt to equity ratio decreased substantially from 2,729.40% to 441.91%, indicating a significant reduction in leverage and associated financial risk. Interest expense increased modestly from £220m to £308m, but interest coverage ratio improved dramatically from 109.09% to 2,114.29%, reflecting the company's much higher operating income relative to interest costs and a strong ability to service debt. The effective tax rate turned negative, which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets, reducing tax-related risk. Liquidity improved as the current ratio rose from 95.29% to 144.27%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. No significant increases in non-current liabilities were observed, remaining stable at around £6,000m. Overall, the company reduced financial risk through deleveraging, improved earnings, and stronger liquidity. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities increased as net cash from investing rose from £115m to £493m, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. However, net cash from operations declined significantly, raising concerns about cash flow sustainability. Dividends increased from £186m to £219m, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings and cash flow, which may pressure liquidity if trends continue. Revenue declines were broad-based across product lines and geographies, with UK revenue falling from £22,207m to £16,240m and other regions also contracting, except for a slight increase in Rest of the World revenue from £1,080m to £1,229m, which may indicate emerging market opportunities. The reduction in revenue and profitability alongside increased investing cash outflows suggests the company is in a transitional phase, potentially investing for future recovery. Close attention to operational improvements and cash flow generation will be critical to support sustainable growth and dividend policy going forward. | Investment activities in 2023 showed a positive net cash inflow from investing of £115m compared to an outflow of £566m in 2022, suggesting a shift towards divestments or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing was a higher outflow at £1,414m versus £917m in 2022, possibly reflecting increased debt repayments or dividend payments, with dividends rising from £59m to £186m, indicating a more shareholder-friendly dividend policy. The net increase in cash was positive at £1,453m, a strong improvement from a decrease of £169m in 2022, supporting cash flow sustainability. Revenue growth was driven by key segments such as British Gas Energy (up from £13,096m to £17,742m) and Centrica Business Solutions (up from £2,981m to £3,516m), while Centrica Energy revenue declined significantly from £14,222m to £7,256m, indicating possible strategic shifts or market changes. Geographically, the UK market expanded from £17,480m to £22,207m, while rest of world revenue declined from £2,598m to £1,080m, suggesting concentration in core markets. Overall, the company appears positioned for sustainable growth with improved cash flow, focused investments, and a supportive dividend policy. |
