# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Centrica plc's revenue declined from £26,458m in 2023 to £19,913m in 2024, after an increase from £23,741m in 2022 to 2023. Despite the revenue drop in 2024, gross profit improved to £4,087m from £2,045m in 2022 but fell sharply from £9,623m in 2023. Gross margin showed volatility, peaking at 159.08% in 2024, up from 153.20% in 2022 but down from 140.01% in 2023, indicating fluctuating cost efficiencies or pricing strategies. By product/service, British Gas Energy remains the largest contributor but dropped from £17,742m in 2023 to £12,065m in 2024, while Centrica Energy revenue decreased significantly from £14,222m in 2022 to £5,723m in 2024. Geographically, the UK dominates revenue, decreasing from £22,207m in 2023 to £16,240m in 2024, with other regions showing mixed trends, notably a decline in Republic of Ireland revenue from £1,438m to £1,021m over the same period. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from a negative (1.01%) in 2022 to a strong 24.61% in 2023 but then declined sharply to 8.55% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating efficiency. Operating income followed a similar pattern, moving from a loss of £240m in 2022 to a profit of £6,512m in 2023, then dropping to £1,703m in 2024, despite revenue decreases. Operating expenses decreased from £3,319m in 2023 to £2,640m in 2024, indicating some cost management efforts, though not sufficient to offset the revenue decline. The ratio of operating income to revenue shows a significant contraction in profitability in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting challenges in maintaining operating leverage amid falling revenues. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate improved substantially from a high positive 66.06% in 2022 to negative rates of (37.59%) in 2023 and (18.70%) in 2024, which positively impacted net profit margins. This tax benefit contributed to net profit recovery from a loss of £636m in 2022 to profits of £4,040m in 2023 and £1,365m in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided data, so the tax rate changes appear to be the primary external influence on profitability during this period. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Centrica plc's total assets decreased to £18,733 million from £21,366 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction in the asset base. Current assets declined to £14,144 million, and non-current assets also reduced to £4,589 million. Total liabilities fell to £13,921 million from £17,133 million, with current liabilities decreasing to £8,902 million and non-current liabilities to £5,019 million. Shareholders' equity increased to £4,422 million from £3,877 million, supported by higher retained earnings (£3,979 million vs. £3,274 million). The current ratio improved to 158.89% from 144.27%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved significantly to 314.81% from 441.91%, suggesting a reduction in leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company shows a healthier balance sheet with reduced liabilities and improved equity, alongside better liquidity and lower leverage in 2024. | In 2023, Centrica plc's total assets decreased significantly to £21,366 million from £29,038 million in 2022, driven by reductions in both current assets (£16,066m vs £20,688m) and non-current assets (£5,300m vs £8,350m). Total liabilities also declined markedly to £17,133 million from £27,758 million, with current liabilities nearly halving to £11,136 million from £21,711 million, while non-current liabilities remained relatively stable (£5,997m vs £6,047m). Shareholders' equity improved substantially to £3,877 million from £1,017 million, reflecting a stronger capital base. The current ratio improved to 144.27% from 95.29%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio, although still high, improved significantly to 441.91% from 2,729.40%, showing a reduction in leverage and a more balanced capital structure. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 shows a stronger equity position, reduced liabilities, and improved liquidity, despite a contraction in asset base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined substantially by 24.8% to £19,913 million in 2024 from £26,458 million in 2023. Despite this, gross margin increased to 159.08% from 140.01%, indicating improved gross profitability relative to revenue, although gross profit fell sharply to £4,087 million from £9,623 million. Operating income dropped significantly to £1,703 million from £6,512 million, with operating margin compressing to 8.55% from 24.61%. Net profit also declined markedly to £1,365 million from £4,040 million, with net profit margin falling to 6.85% from 15.27%. Return on equity (ROE) decreased sharply to 32.90% from 165.10%, and return on assets (ROA) declined to 6.81% from 16.03%, reflecting lower overall profitability and earnings quality. The effective tax rate dropped to 18.70% from 37.59%, contributing to a smaller tax expense. Interest expense slightly increased, but interest coverage remained strong at 505.34%, down from an exceptionally high 2,114.29%. Overall, profitability weakened significantly in 2024, with margins and returns declining despite improved gross margin percentage. | Centrica plc demonstrated a remarkable turnaround in profitability in 2023. Revenue increased by 11.4% to £26,458 million from £23,741 million in 2022. Gross profit surged to £9,623 million from £2,045 million, despite a slight decline in gross margin from 153.20% to 140.01%, indicating improved absolute profitability but some margin compression. Operating income swung from a loss of £240 million to a strong profit of £6,512 million, lifting operating margin from negative 1.01% to a robust 24.61%. Net profit turned positive at £4,040 million compared to a loss of £636 million, with net profit margin improving to 15.27% from negative 2.68%. Return on equity was very strong at 165.10%, and return on assets was 16.03%, both indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate was negative at (37.59)%, reflecting tax benefits or credits impacting net income positively. Interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 2,114.29% from 109.09%, showing strong ability to cover interest expenses. Overall, 2023 marks a significant improvement in profitability and earnings quality for Centrica. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost of goods sold increased to £11,764 million from £10,585 million despite lower revenue, indicating cost pressures or less favorable cost structure. Operating expenses decreased to £2,640 million from £3,319 million, showing some cost control efforts. Asset turnover slightly declined to 99.32% from 104.98%, indicating a marginal reduction in asset utilization efficiency. Net cash from operations dropped sharply to £1,149 million from £2,752 million, reflecting weaker cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased to £904 million from £1,079 million, which may indicate tighter inventory management. Net cash from investing activities increased to £493 million from £115 million, suggesting higher investment or asset sales. Net cash from financing activities outflow increased to £1,548 million from £1,414 million, consistent with dividend payments rising to £219 million from £186 million. Overall, operational efficiency weakened in cash generation and asset utilization, though cost control on operating expenses was evident. | Operational efficiency improved notably in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased to £10,585 million from £12,630 million despite higher revenue, contributing to a higher gross profit. Operating expenses increased to £3,319 million from £2,378 million, but this was more than offset by the large increase in gross profit, resulting in a positive operating income. Asset turnover was very high at 104.98%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations more than doubled to £2,752 million from £1,314 million, reflecting strong cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased slightly to £1,079 million from £1,269 million, suggesting effective inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets and current liabilities both decreased, but the current ratio increase indicates better liquidity management. Net cash from investing activities turned positive at £115 million from a negative £566 million, indicating possible divestments or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities was negative £1,414 million, higher than the previous year, reflecting increased debt repayments or dividend payments. Overall, operational efficiency and cash flow generation improved significantly in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage decreased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio improving to 314.81% from 441.91%, reducing financial risk. Liquidity improved with the current ratio rising to 158.89% from 144.27%, indicating better ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest coverage ratio, while lower than 2023, remains robust at 505.34%, suggesting strong capacity to cover interest expenses despite a slight increase in interest expense to £337 million. The effective tax rate declined significantly to 18.70% from 37.59%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially reducing tax-related risk. However, the sharp decline in profitability and cash flow from operations could pose risks to financial flexibility. No other explicit risk indicators are present, but the reduced earnings and cash flow warrant monitoring for sustainability. | Financial risk indicators show a reduction in leverage and improved liquidity in 2023. The debt to equity ratio decreased substantially to 441.91% from an extremely high 2,729.40%, indicating a meaningful reduction in financial leverage and associated risk. The current ratio improved to 144.27% from 95.29%, signaling better short-term liquidity and reduced risk of liquidity stress. Interest expense increased to £308 million from £220 million, but the interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 2,114.29% from 109.09%, reflecting much higher earnings relative to interest costs and a strong buffer against interest rate risk. The effective tax rate shifted from a high positive 66.06% in 2022 to a negative (37.59)% in 2023, which may indicate tax credits or deferred tax assets, but also introduces some variability in tax expense predictability. The significant reduction in liabilities and improved equity base reduce solvency risk. However, the still elevated debt to equity ratio suggests some ongoing leverage risk. Overall, financial risk has decreased but should be monitored given the remaining leverage. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity increased as indicated by higher net cash from investing (£493 million vs. £115 million), which may support future growth or asset renewal. Cash flow sustainability is challenged by the significant drop in net cash from operations (£1,149 million vs. £2,752 million), which may constrain internal funding capacity. Dividend payments increased to £219 million from £186 million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings and cash flow. Revenue by segment shows declines across most business lines, notably British Gas Energy (£12,065 million vs. £17,742 million) and Centrica Business Solutions (£2,543 million vs. £3,516 million), indicating potential headwinds in core markets. Geographically, UK revenue decreased substantially to £16,240 million from £22,207 million, while rest of the world revenue slightly increased to £1,229 million from £1,080 million, suggesting some geographic diversification. Overall, future performance may face challenges due to lower revenue and cash flow, but investment and dividend policies indicate a balanced approach to growth and shareholder returns. | Centrica’s 2023 financials suggest a positive outlook for future performance. The company generated strong net cash from operations (£2,752 million), more than double the prior year, supporting cash flow sustainability. Net cash from investing activities turned positive (£115 million), indicating possible asset sales or reduced capital expenditure, which may free up cash for other uses. Financing cash flow was negative (£1,414 million), including higher dividend payments (£186 million vs £59 million in 2022), signaling a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Revenue growth was driven by key segments such as British Gas Energy (£17,742 million, up from £13,096 million) and Centrica Business Solutions (£3,516 million, up from £2,981 million), while Centrica Energy revenue declined (£7,256 million vs £14,222 million), suggesting a strategic shift or market changes. Geographically, the UK remains the dominant market with increased revenue (£22,207 million vs £17,480 million), while other regions showed mixed trends. The improved profitability, strong cash flow, and focused segment growth indicate potential for sustained financial performance, though monitoring investment in non-core segments and geographic diversification will be important for balanced growth. |
