# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Centrica plc's revenue declined from £26,458m in 2023 to £19,913m in 2024 after an increase from £23,741m in 2022 to 2023. Despite this revenue drop, gross margin improved to 156.77% in 2024 from 138.49% in 2023, indicating better cost control or pricing power relative to cost of goods sold, which increased from -£10,185m in 2023 to -£11,304m in 2024 but was lower than 2022's -£12,630m. Revenue by product/service shows significant decreases in British Gas Energy from £17,742m in 2023 to £12,065m in 2024 and Centrica Energy from £7,256m to £5,723m, while Upstream revenue increased notably from £1,505m to £1,607m. Geographically, UK revenue dropped sharply from £22,207m in 2023 to £16,240m in 2024, with smaller declines in Republic of Ireland and Europe, but Rest of the World revenue increased from £1,080m to £1,229m, suggesting regional shifts in sales focus or market conditions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 24.61% in 2023 to 8.55% in 2024, reflecting a drop in operating income from £6,512m to £1,703m despite the revenue decrease. Operating expenses decreased from -£3,319m in 2023 to -£2,640m in 2024, indicating some cost management efforts, but these were insufficient to offset the revenue and operating income decline. The operating income as a percentage of revenue fell from approximately 24.61% to 8.55%, highlighting reduced operational efficiency or increased cost pressures. The negative operating income of -£240m in 2022 turning positive in subsequent years shows an improving trend until 2024's setback. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate improved substantially from 66.06% in 2022 to negative rates of -37.59% in 2023 and -18.70% in 2024, which positively impacted net profit margins, helping net profit recover from a loss of -£636m in 2022 to profits of £4,040m in 2023 and £1,365m in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors are listed in the provided data, but the large swings in tax rates and net profit margins suggest significant tax-related or one-off adjustments influencing profitability. The reduction in income tax expense from -£2,433m in 2023 to -£314m in 2024 also supports this interpretation. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Centrica plc's total assets decreased to £18,733 million from £21,366 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction in the asset base. Current assets declined to £14,144 million from £16,066 million, and non-current assets also reduced to £4,589 million from £5,300 million. Total liabilities decreased significantly to £13,921 million from £17,133 million, with current liabilities dropping to £8,902 million from £11,136 million and non-current liabilities to £5,019 million from £5,997 million. Shareholders' equity improved to £4,422 million from £3,877 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings to £3,979 million from £3,274 million. The current ratio improved to 158.89% from 144.27%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved markedly to 314.81% from 441.91%, suggesting a reduction in leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company shows a healthier balance sheet with reduced liabilities and improved equity, alongside better liquidity and lower leverage in 2024 compared to 2023. | In 2023, Centrica plc's total assets decreased significantly to £21,366 million from £29,038 million in 2022, driven by reductions in both current assets (£16,066m vs £20,688m) and non-current assets (£5,300m vs £8,350m). Total liabilities also declined markedly to £17,133 million from £27,758 million, with current liabilities nearly halving to £11,136 million from £21,711 million, while non-current liabilities remained relatively stable (£5,997m vs £6,047m). Shareholders' equity improved substantially to £3,877 million from £1,017 million, reflecting a stronger capital base. The current ratio improved to 144.27% from 95.29%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio, although still high, improved significantly to 441.91% from 2,729.40%, suggesting a reduction in leverage and a more balanced capital structure. Overall, the company shows improved financial health with reduced liabilities and stronger equity, alongside better liquidity and a more manageable leverage profile in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Centrica plc experienced a notable decline in revenue in 2024, falling to £19,913 million from £26,458 million in 2023. Despite this, the gross margin increased to 156.77% from 138.49%, indicating improved gross profitability relative to revenue, although gross profit in absolute terms dropped to £4,087 million from £9,623 million. Operating income decreased sharply to £1,703 million from £6,512 million, with operating margin contracting to 8.55% from 24.61%. Net profit also declined to £1,365 million from £4,040 million, with net profit margin falling to 6.85% from 15.27%. Return on equity (ROE) dropped significantly to 32.90% from 165.10%, and return on assets (ROA) declined to 6.81% from 16.03%, reflecting lower overall profitability and earnings quality. The effective tax rate decreased substantially to 18.70% from 37.59%, which partially cushioned net income. Interest expense slightly increased to £337 million from £308 million, but interest coverage remained strong at 505.34%, down from an exceptionally high 2114.29%. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 with lower revenues and profits, but margins and tax efficiency showed some resilience. | Centrica plc demonstrated a strong turnaround in profitability in 2023. Revenue increased by 11.4% to £26,458 million from £23,741 million in 2022. Gross profit surged to £9,623 million from £2,045 million, despite a slight decline in gross margin percentage to 138.49% from 153.20%, indicating improved absolute profitability but some margin compression. Operating income turned positive at £6,512 million compared to a loss of £240 million in 2022, with operating margin improving dramatically to 24.61% from negative 1.01%. Net profit also reversed from a loss of £636 million to a gain of £4,040 million, lifting net profit margin to 15.27% from negative 2.68%. Return on equity was strong at 165.10%, and return on assets was 16.03%, both indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate shifted from a high positive 66.06% in 2022 to a negative 37.59% in 2023, which may reflect tax benefits or adjustments impacting net income positively. Interest expense increased slightly to £308 million, but was well covered by operating income, as reflected in the very high interest coverage ratio of 2114.29%. Overall, 2023 marks a significant improvement in profitability and earnings quality for Centrica. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 shows mixed signals. Cost of goods sold increased to £11,304 million from £10,185 million despite lower revenue, indicating higher cost pressure or changes in cost structure. Operating expenses decreased to £2,640 million from £3,319 million, reflecting some cost control efforts. Asset turnover slightly declined to 99.32% from 104.98%, indicating a marginal reduction in asset utilization efficiency. Net cash from operations dropped significantly to £1,149 million from £2,752 million, signaling weaker cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased to £904 million from £1,079 million, which may indicate improved inventory management or reduced sales volume. Net cash from investing activities increased to £493 million from £115 million, suggesting higher investment or asset sales. Net cash from financing activities outflow increased to £1,548 million from £1,414 million, consistent with dividend payments rising to £219 million from £186 million. The net increase in cash was minimal at £94 million compared to £1,453 million in 2023, indicating tighter cash flow conditions. Overall, operational efficiency shows cost containment but weaker cash flow generation and slightly reduced asset utilization in 2024. | Operational efficiency improved markedly in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased to £10,185 million from £12,630 million despite higher revenue, contributing to a substantial increase in gross profit. Operating expenses rose to £3,319 million from £2,378 million, but this was more than offset by the increase in gross profit, resulting in a strong operating income. Asset turnover was very high at 104.98%, indicating excellent utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations more than doubled to £2,752 million from £1,314 million, reflecting improved cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased slightly to £1,079 million from £1,269 million, suggesting effective inventory management. Net cash from investing activities turned positive to £115 million from a negative £566 million, indicating possible divestments or reduced capital expenditures. However, net cash from financing activities increased in outflow to £1,414 million from £917 million, possibly reflecting debt repayments or dividend payments. The net increase in cash was £1,453 million compared to a decrease of £169 million in 2022, highlighting improved cash flow management and liquidity. Overall, Centrica enhanced operational efficiency through better cost control, asset utilization, and cash flow generation in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators improved in 2024. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 314.81% from 441.91%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. The current ratio improved to 158.89% from 144.27%, enhancing liquidity risk profile. Interest coverage, while lower than 2023, remained robust at 505.34%, suggesting strong ability to meet interest obligations despite a slight increase in interest expense to £337 million. The effective tax rate dropped significantly to 18.70% from 37.59%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, reducing tax-related risk. However, the sharp decline in net profit margin and operating margin signals potential earnings volatility risk. The substantial reduction in net cash from operations to £1,149 million from £2,752 million could pressure liquidity if sustained. Overall, leverage and liquidity risks have improved, but profitability and cash flow volatility present cautionary signals. | Financial risk indicators show improvement but some caution remains. The debt to equity ratio, while improved to 441.91% from an extremely high 2,729.40% in 2022, still indicates a high leverage level, which could pose financial risk if earnings or cash flows deteriorate. The current ratio improved to 144.27% from 95.29%, suggesting better liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense increased to £308 million from £220 million, but interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 2114.29% from 109.09%, indicating strong earnings relative to interest costs and low risk of default on interest payments. The effective tax rate shifted to a negative 37.59% from a positive 66.06%, which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets but could also indicate volatility in tax obligations. The significant reduction in total liabilities and improved equity base reduce solvency risk. However, the high leverage and volatility in tax rate warrant monitoring. No other explicit risk indicators such as contingent liabilities or off-balance sheet items are provided. Overall, financial risk has decreased but leverage remains a key area to watch. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Centrica plc's increased net cash from investing activities to £493 million suggests ongoing or increased investment activity, which could support future growth. However, the significant reduction in net cash from operations to £1,149 million raises concerns about cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments increased to £219 million, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings and cash flow, which may pressure future liquidity if earnings do not recover. Revenue declines across key segments such as British Gas Energy (£12,065 million in 2024 vs £17,742 million in 2023) and Centrica Business Solutions (£2,543 million vs £3,516 million) highlight challenges in core markets, particularly the UK where revenue fell to £16,240 million from £22,207 million. Growth in the 'Rest of the world' region to £1,229 million from £1,080 million may offer some geographic diversification benefits. The company’s improved capital structure and liquidity position provide a buffer to support future investments and operations. Overall, while investment activity and dividend policy remain active, the company faces challenges in revenue and cash flow sustainability that will require strategic focus to ensure future financial performance stability. | Centrica's future financial performance appears promising based on 2023 data. The company increased investment returns as net cash from investing turned positive (£115 million), suggesting possible asset sales or more efficient capital allocation. The strong net cash from operations (£2,752 million) and positive net increase in cash (£1,453 million) indicate sustainable cash flow generation to support ongoing operations and investments. Dividend payments increased to £186 million from £59 million, signaling confidence in cash flow sustainability and a shareholder-friendly policy. Revenue growth was driven by key segments such as British Gas Energy (£17,742 million, up from £13,096 million) and Centrica Business Solutions (£3,516 million, up from £2,981 million), while Centrica Energy revenue declined to £7,256 million from £14,222 million, indicating a shift in business mix. Geographically, the UK remains the dominant market with increased revenue (£22,207 million vs £17,480 million), while other regions showed mixed trends. The improved profitability, cash flow, and capital structure support positive future performance, but the decline in some segments and geographic shifts should be monitored for strategic adjustments. Overall, Centrica is positioned for continued financial strength with prudent investment and dividend policies in 2023. |
