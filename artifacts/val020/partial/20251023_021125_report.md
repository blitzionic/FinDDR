# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Centrica plc's revenue declined from £26,458m in 2023 to £19,913m in 2024, after an increase from £23,741m in 2022 to 2023. Despite this revenue drop, gross profit decreased sharply from £9,623m in 2023 to £4,087m in 2024, reflecting a gross margin increase from 139.91% in 2023 to 157.57% in 2024, indicating improved cost efficiency relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service shows significant declines in British Gas Energy from £17,742m in 2023 to £12,065m in 2024 and Centrica Energy from £7,256m to £5,723m, while Upstream revenue increased notably from £1,505m to £1,607m. Geographically, UK revenue dropped from £22,207m in 2023 to £16,240m in 2024, with smaller declines in Republic of Ireland and Europe, but Rest of the World revenue increased from £1,080m to £1,229m, suggesting a geographic shift in revenue sources. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 24.61% in 2023 to 8.55% in 2024, with operating income falling from £6,512m to £1,703m despite the revenue decrease. Operating expenses reduced from £3,319m in 2023 to £2,640m in 2024, indicating some cost management, but not enough to offset the sharp drop in operating income. The negative operating income of £240m in 2022 turned positive in 2023 and 2024, showing an overall improvement in operational profitability over the three years, though 2024's performance is weaker compared to 2023. The ratio of operating income to revenue reflects this trend, with a strong recovery in 2023 followed by a notable decline in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate improved substantially from 66.06% in 2022 to negative rates of (37.59%) in 2023 and (18.70%) in 2024, which positively impacted net profit margins, contributing to net profits of £3,929m in 2023 and £1,332m in 2024 compared to a net loss of £636m in 2022. Income tax expense decreased from £2,433m in 2023 to £314m in 2024, reflecting this tax rate change. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided data, so the tax rate changes appear to be the primary external influence on profitability during this period. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Centrica plc's total assets decreased to £18,733 million from £21,366 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction in the asset base. Current assets declined to £14,144 million from £16,066 million, and non-current assets also reduced to £4,589 million from £5,300 million. Total liabilities decreased significantly to £13,921 million from £17,133 million, with current liabilities dropping to £8,902 million from £11,136 million and non-current liabilities falling to £5,019 million from £5,997 million. Shareholders' equity improved to £4,422 million from £3,877 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings to £3,979 million from £3,274 million. The current ratio improved to 158.89% from 144.27%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved markedly to 314.81% from 441.91%, suggesting a reduction in leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company shows a healthier balance sheet with reduced liabilities and improved equity, alongside better liquidity and lower leverage in 2024 compared to 2023. | In 2023, Centrica plc's total assets decreased significantly to £21,366 million from £29,038 million in 2022, driven by reductions in both current assets (£16,066 million vs. £20,688 million) and non-current assets (£5,300 million vs. £8,350 million). Total liabilities also declined markedly to £17,133 million from £27,758 million, with current liabilities nearly halving to £11,136 million from £21,711 million, while non-current liabilities remained relatively stable (£5,997 million vs. £6,047 million). Shareholders' equity improved substantially to £3,877 million from £1,017 million, reflecting a stronger capital base. The current ratio improved to 144.27% from 95.29%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio, although still high, improved significantly to 441.91% from 2,729.40%, suggesting a better capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company shows improved financial health with stronger equity and liquidity positions despite a contraction in asset base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Centrica plc experienced a notable decline in revenue to £19,913 million in 2024 from £26,458 million in 2023, a decrease of approximately 24.7%. Despite this, the gross margin increased to 157.57% from 139.91%, indicating improved gross profitability relative to revenue. However, operating income dropped sharply to £1,703 million from £6,512 million, causing the operating margin to fall to 8.55% from 24.61%. Net profit also declined significantly to £1,332 million from £3,929 million, with the net profit margin decreasing to 6.69% from 14.85%. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) both declined substantially to 32.10% and 6.64% respectively, from 160.56% and 15.59% in 2023, reflecting lower overall profitability and earnings quality. The effective tax rate dropped to 18.70% from 37.59%, which partially cushioned net income. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 with lower revenue and earnings, despite improved gross margin and tax efficiency. | Centrica plc demonstrated a strong turnaround in profitability in 2023. Revenue increased by 11.4% to £26,458 million from £23,741 million in 2022. Gross profit surged to £9,623 million from £2,045 million, despite a slight decline in gross margin percentage to 139.91% from 153.20%, indicating improved absolute profitability but some margin compression. Operating income turned positive at £6,512 million compared to a loss of £240 million in 2022, with operating margin improving dramatically to 24.61% from negative 1.01%. Net profit rose sharply to £3,929 million from a loss of £636 million, with net profit margin improving to 14.85% from negative 2.68%. Return on equity was strong at 160.56%, and return on assets was 15.59%, both indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of capital. The effective tax rate was negative at -37.59%, a reversal from 66.06% in 2022, which may reflect tax benefits or adjustments impacting net income positively. Interest coverage ratio improved substantially to 2,114.29% from 109.09%, indicating strong ability to cover interest expenses. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 shows mixed results. Cost of goods sold increased to £11,464 million from £10,560 million despite lower revenue, indicating cost pressures or changes in cost structure. Operating expenses decreased to £2,640 million from £3,319 million, reflecting some cost control efforts. Asset turnover slightly declined to 99.32% from 104.98%, indicating a marginal reduction in how efficiently assets generate revenue. Net cash from operations fell sharply to £1,149 million from £2,752 million, signaling weaker cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased to £904 million from £1,079 million, which may reflect better inventory management or reduced sales volume. Net cash from investing increased to £493 million from £115 million, suggesting more cash inflows or reduced investment outflows. Net cash from financing outflows increased to £1,548 million from £1,414 million, with dividends paid rising to £219 million from £186 million. Overall, operational efficiency weakened in cash generation and asset utilization, though cost control on operating expenses was evident. | Operational efficiency improved notably in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased to £10,560 million from £12,630 million despite higher revenue, contributing to a higher gross profit. Operating expenses increased to £3,319 million from £2,378 million, but this was offset by the large increase in operating income. Asset turnover was very high at 104.98%, indicating excellent utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations more than doubled to £2,752 million from £1,314 million, reflecting strong cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased slightly to £1,079 million from £1,269 million, suggesting efficient inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets and current liabilities both decreased, but the current ratio increase indicates better liquidity management. Overall, the company demonstrated strong cost control and asset utilization, with robust operational cash flow supporting business activities. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators improved in 2024. The debt to equity ratio decreased significantly to 314.81% from 441.91%, indicating reduced financial leverage and lower solvency risk. The current ratio improved to 158.89% from 144.27%, enhancing liquidity risk profile. Interest expense slightly increased to £337 million from £308 million, but interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 505.34%, down from an exceptionally high 2114.29% in 2023, still indicating ample ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate dropped to 18.70% from 37.59%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially reducing tax-related risks. The decline in net profit and operating income, alongside reduced cash from operations, could pose operational risks if trends continue. Overall, leverage and liquidity risks have improved, interest coverage remains robust, but profitability and cash flow declines warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators show improvement but some caution remains. The debt to equity ratio, while improved to 441.91% from an extremely high 2,729.40%, still indicates significant leverage, which could pose risk if earnings or cash flow weaken. Interest expense increased to £308 million from £220 million, but the interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 2,114.29%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest costs and reduced risk of default. The effective tax rate turned negative to -37.59% from 66.06%, which may indicate tax credits or adjustments but could also signal volatility in tax obligations. Liquidity improved with a current ratio of 144.27%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. The large reduction in total liabilities and improved equity base reduce solvency risk. However, the high leverage and volatility in tax rate warrant monitoring. No other explicit risk factors are evident from the data. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Centrica plc's increased net cash from investing (£493 million vs £115 million in 2023) suggests potential for investment activity or asset disposals that could impact future growth. The modest net increase in cash (£94 million) and continued dividend payments (£219 million) indicate a commitment to shareholder returns but also pressure on cash flow sustainability given reduced operational cash generation. Revenue declines across key segments such as British Gas Energy (£12,065 million vs £17,742 million) and Centrica Business Solutions (£2,543 million vs £3,516 million) highlight challenges in core markets, particularly the UK where revenue fell to £16,240 million from £22,207 million. However, some geographic diversification is evident with increased revenue in the Rest of the World (£1,229 million vs £1,080 million). The company may need to focus on operational improvements and strategic investments to stabilize revenue and profitability. Overall, future performance will depend on managing cash flow sustainability, investment effectiveness, and addressing revenue declines in key segments and regions. | Centrica plc's future financial performance appears promising based on 2023 data. Net cash from investing activities turned positive to £115 million from an outflow of £566 million, suggesting potential divestments or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities increased outflow to £1,414 million from £917 million, with dividends paid rising to £186 million from £59 million, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue growth was driven by key segments such as British Gas Energy (£17,742 million, up from £13,096 million) and Centrica Business Solutions (£3,516 million, up from £2,981 million), while Centrica Energy revenue declined to £7,256 million from £14,222 million, signaling possible strategic shifts. Geographic revenue growth was strong in the UK (£22,207 million vs. £17,480 million) and stable or modest in other regions. The strong operational cash flow and improved profitability support sustainable dividend policy and potential for reinvestment. However, the decline in total assets and segment shifts suggest ongoing portfolio optimization. Overall, the company is positioned for continued financial stability and growth, with focus on core markets and efficient capital deployment. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Centrica plc faces market risks primarily from fluctuations in commodity prices (gas, electricity, oil, emissions), foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. The Group's energy price exposed business activities are subject to volatility in wholesale commodity markets, impacting procurement costs, sales prices, and margins. Volumetric risk arises from uncertain consumption profiles influenced by weather, customer behavior, and economic conditions.
