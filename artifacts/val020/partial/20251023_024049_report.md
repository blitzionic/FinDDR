# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Centrica plc's revenue showed a decline from £26,458m in 2023 to £19,913m in 2024 after an increase from £23,741m in 2022 to 2023. Gross margin decreased significantly from 61.51% in 2023 to 43.23% in 2024, down from 46.80% in 2022, indicating rising cost pressures or lower pricing power. Revenue by product/service reveals that British Gas Energy remains the largest contributor but dropped from £17,742m in 2023 to £12,065m in 2024. Centrica Energy also declined sharply from £7,256m in 2023 to £5,723m in 2024, while Upstream revenue increased from £1,505m to £1,607m. Geographically, UK revenue fell from £22,207m in 2023 to £16,240m in 2024, with smaller declines in Republic of Ireland and Europe, while Rest of the World revenue increased slightly from £1,080m to £1,229m, indicating regional revenue concentration and exposure to UK market fluctuations. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from a negative -1.01% in 2022 to a strong 24.61% in 2023 but then declined sharply to 8.55% in 2024, reflecting volatility in operating performance. Operating income followed a similar pattern, rising from a loss of £240m in 2022 to a profit of £6,512m in 2023, then dropping to £1,703m in 2024 despite revenue remaining relatively high. Operating expenses decreased from £3,319m in 2023 to £2,640m in 2024, showing some cost management, but this was insufficient to offset the revenue and gross profit declines. The data suggests that while Centrica managed to control operating expenses, the sharp drop in gross profit and revenue heavily impacted operating income and margin in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate swung dramatically from a high positive 66.06% in 2022 to negative rates of -37.59% in 2023 and -18.70% in 2024, indicating significant tax benefits or credits impacting net profitability. This contributed to net profit margin recovery from a negative -3.29% in 2022 to 15.27% in 2023 and then a decline to 6.85% in 2024. Income tax expense fell from £2,433m in 2023 to £314m in 2024, consistent with the lower effective tax rate. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors are listed, but the tax rate volatility and large swings in profitability suggest external tax or regulatory impacts materially influenced Centrica's net results. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Centrica plc's total assets decreased to £18,733 million from £21,366 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction in the asset base. Current assets also declined to £14,144 million from £16,066 million, while non-current assets reduced to £4,589 million from £5,300 million. Total liabilities decreased significantly to £13,921 million from £17,133 million, with current liabilities dropping to £8,902 million from £11,136 million and non-current liabilities to £5,019 million from £5,997 million. Shareholders' equity improved to £4,422 million from £3,877 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings to £3,979 million from £3,274 million. The current ratio improved to 1.59 from 1.44, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 3.15 from 4.42, suggesting a reduction in financial leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company shows improved equity position and liquidity despite a smaller asset base and liabilities, indicating a more conservative financial stance in 2024. | In 2023, Centrica plc's total assets decreased significantly to £21,366 million from £29,038 million in 2022, driven by reductions in both current assets (£16,066m vs £20,688m) and non-current assets (£5,300m vs £8,350m). Total liabilities also declined markedly to £17,133 million from £27,758 million, with current liabilities nearly halving to £11,136 million from £21,711 million, while non-current liabilities remained relatively stable (£5,997m vs £6,047m). Shareholders' equity improved substantially to £3,877 million from £1,017 million, supported by a strong increase in retained earnings to £3,274 million from a deficit of £466 million. The current ratio improved from below 1 (0.95) to a healthier 1.44, indicating better short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio dropped sharply from 27.29 to 4.42, reflecting a much stronger capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company shows improved financial health in 2023 with stronger equity base, reduced liabilities, and enhanced liquidity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Centrica plc experienced a notable decline in profitability in 2024. Revenue fell sharply to £19,913 million from £26,458 million in 2023, a decrease of approximately 25%. Despite this, cost of goods sold increased to £11,304 million from £10,185 million, resulting in a gross profit drop to £4,087 million from £9,623 million. Gross margin contracted significantly to 43.2% from 61.5%. Operating income declined steeply to £1,703 million from £6,512 million, with operating margin falling to 8.55% from 24.6%. Net profit dropped to £1,365 million from £4,040 million, and net profit margin decreased to 6.85% from 15.3%. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) also declined markedly to 32.9% and 6.8% respectively from 165.1% and 16.0%, indicating reduced earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns. The effective tax rate improved (less negative) to -18.7% from -37.6%, and interest expense slightly increased to £337 million from £308 million, with interest coverage ratio falling to 5.05 from 21.14, signaling reduced ability to cover interest costs. Overall, profitability and earnings quality worsened significantly in 2024. | Centrica plc demonstrated a remarkable turnaround in profitability in 2023. Revenue increased by approximately 11.4% to £26,458 million from £23,741 million in 2022. Gross profit surged to £9,623 million from £2,045 million, lifting the gross margin from 46.8% to 61.5%. Operating income swung from a loss of £240 million to a profit of £6,512 million, improving the operating margin from -1.0% to 24.6%. Net profit turned positive at £4,040 million compared to a loss of £782 million in 2022, with net profit margin rising from -3.3% to 15.3%. Return on equity was strong at 165.1%, and return on assets was 16.0%, indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate was negative (-37.6%), likely due to tax benefits or adjustments, contrasting with a high tax rate of 66.1% in 2022. Interest expense increased slightly to £308 million, but was well covered by operating income (interest coverage ratio of 21.1). Overall, 2023 reflects a significant improvement in profitability and earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 weakened compared to 2023. The asset turnover ratio slightly decreased to 0.99 from 1.05, indicating marginally less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses were reduced to £2,640 million from £3,319 million, showing some cost control efforts. However, net cash from operations dropped sharply to £1,149 million from £2,752 million, reflecting lower cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased to £904 million from £1,079 million, which may indicate tighter inventory management or reduced sales volume. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supported by a higher current ratio. Net cash from investing activities increased to £493 million from £115 million, suggesting increased investment activity. Net cash from financing activities showed a higher outflow of £1,548 million compared to £1,414 million, including increased dividend payments (£219 million vs £186 million). The net increase in cash was minimal at £94 million compared to £1,453 million in 2023, indicating constrained cash flow availability. Overall, operational efficiency declined with lower cash flow generation despite some cost reductions. | Operational efficiency improved notably in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased to £10,185 million from £12,630 million despite higher revenue, contributing to a higher gross margin. Operating expenses increased to £3,319 million from £2,378 million, but this was more than offset by the large increase in gross profit. Asset turnover was 1.05, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations more than doubled to £2,752 million from £1,314 million, reflecting strong cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased slightly to £1,079 million from £1,269 million, suggesting efficient inventory management. Net cash from investing activities turned positive at £115 million compared to an outflow of £566 million in 2022, indicating possible divestments or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities showed a higher outflow of £1,414 million versus £917 million, partly due to increased dividends paid (£186 million vs £59 million). Overall, Centrica improved cost control, asset utilization, and cash flow generation in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show mixed signals. The debt to equity ratio improved to 3.15 from 4.42, indicating reduced leverage and potentially lower financial risk. However, the interest coverage ratio deteriorated significantly to 5.05 from 21.14, reflecting a reduced buffer to cover interest expenses and increased risk of financial distress if earnings decline further. The effective tax rate improved but remains negative at -18.7%, which may reflect tax credits or losses carried forward, but also introduces some uncertainty in tax obligations. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio rising to 1.59 from 1.44, reducing short-term liquidity risk. The decline in net cash from operations and minimal net cash increase raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. The increase in interest expense despite lower liabilities suggests possible higher borrowing costs or refinancing risk. Overall, while leverage and liquidity improved, the reduced interest coverage and cash flow constraints highlight emerging financial risks that require monitoring. | Financial risk indicators improved significantly in 2023. The debt to equity ratio fell sharply from 27.29 to 4.42, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. The current ratio improved to 1.44 from 0.95, enhancing short-term liquidity and reducing liquidity risk. Interest coverage ratio improved dramatically from negative (-1.09) to a strong 21.14, showing ample earnings to cover interest expenses despite a slight increase in interest expense to £308 million. The effective tax rate turned negative (-37.6%) from a high positive rate (66.1%), which may indicate tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces some uncertainty in tax expense predictability. The large reduction in liabilities and improved equity position reduce solvency risk. However, the significant changes in tax rate and the negative tax expense warrant monitoring. Overall, financial risk has decreased with improved leverage, liquidity, and interest coverage, but tax-related risks remain a consideration. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Centrica plc's increased net cash from investing activities (£493 million vs £115 million in 2023) indicates a focus on investment and potential growth initiatives. However, the sharp decline in revenue and profitability, especially in key segments such as British Gas Energy (down from £17,742 million to £12,065 million) and Centrica Business Solutions (down from £3,516 million to £2,543 million), suggests challenges in core markets. Geographic revenue declines in the UK and Republic of Ireland also point to regional pressures. The company maintained dividend payments with a slight increase (£219 million vs £186 million), signaling a commitment to shareholder returns but potentially pressuring cash flow. The modest net increase in cash (£94 million) and reduced operational cash flow raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. The improved capital structure and liquidity provide some buffer for future uncertainties. Overall, future performance will depend on the success of investment activities, ability to stabilize or grow revenues in key segments and regions, and maintaining cash flow to support dividends and debt obligations. | Centrica's 2023 financials suggest a positive outlook for future performance. The company generated strong operational cash flow (£2,752 million) and turned investing cash flow positive (£115 million), indicating potential for sustainable cash flow and possible strategic divestments or reduced capital spending. The increased dividend payout (£186 million) compared to 2022 signals confidence in cash flow sustainability and a shareholder-friendly policy. Revenue growth was driven by key segments such as British Gas Energy (£17,742 million, up from £13,096 million) and Centrica Business Solutions (£3,516 million, up from £2,981 million), while Centrica Energy revenue declined (£7,256 million from £14,222 million), suggesting a shift in business focus or portfolio rebalancing. Geographically, the UK remains the dominant market with increased revenue (£22,207 million vs £17,480 million), while revenues in other regions showed mixed trends. The strong profitability, improved balance sheet, and positive cash flow trends support a favorable future financial performance, though monitoring segment shifts and tax impacts will be important. |
