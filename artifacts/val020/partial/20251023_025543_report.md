# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Centrica plc's revenue showed a decline from £26,458m in 2023 to £19,913m in 2024 after an increase from £23,741m in 2022 to 2023. Gross margin decreased significantly from 59.99% in 2023 to 42.45% in 2024, down from 46.80% in 2022, indicating rising cost pressures or lower pricing power. By product/service, British Gas Energy remains the largest contributor but dropped from £17,742m in 2023 to £12,065m in 2024, while Centrica Energy also declined sharply from £7,256m in 2023 to £5,723m in 2024. Geographically, UK revenue fell from £22,207m in 2023 to £16,240m in 2024, with similar declines in Republic of Ireland and Europe, reflecting broad-based revenue contraction across key markets. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined steeply from 24.61% in 2023 to 8.55% in 2024, recovering from a negative margin of (1.01%) in 2022. Operating income fell from £6,512m in 2023 to £1,703m in 2024, despite revenue decreasing, indicating worsening operational leverage. Operating expenses decreased from £3,319m in 2023 to £2,640m in 2024, but not proportionally to revenue, suggesting cost management was insufficient to offset revenue declines. The negative operating income in 2022 (-£240m) turning positive in 2023 and 2024 shows some operational recovery, but the sharp drop in 2024 highlights challenges in sustaining efficiency gains. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate improved markedly from a high 66.06% in 2022 to negative rates of (37.59%) in 2023 and (18.70%) in 2024, which positively impacted net profitability despite lower pre-tax earnings. Income tax expense dropped from £(2,433)m in 2023 to £(314)m in 2024, supporting net profit recovery. Non-recurring items are not explicitly listed, but the large swings in tax rates and net profit margins suggest significant tax-related or one-off adjustments. No other external factors explicitly affecting profitability are provided in the data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Centrica plc's total assets decreased to £18,733 million from £21,366 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction in the asset base. Current assets declined to £14,144 million from £16,066 million, and non-current assets also reduced to £4,589 million from £5,300 million. Total liabilities fell to £13,921 million from £17,133 million, with current liabilities decreasing to £8,902 million and non-current liabilities to £5,019 million. Shareholders' equity increased to £4,422 million from £3,877 million, supported by a rise in retained earnings to £3,979 million. The current ratio improved to 158.89% from 144.27%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved significantly to 314.81% from 441.91%, suggesting a reduction in leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company shows a healthier balance sheet with reduced liabilities and improved liquidity, though asset contraction may warrant monitoring. | In 2023, Centrica plc demonstrated a stronger financial position compared to 2022. Total assets decreased from £29,038m to £21,366m, driven by reductions in both current assets (£20,688m to £16,066m) and non-current assets (£8,350m to £5,300m). Total liabilities also declined significantly from £27,758m to £17,133m, with current liabilities nearly halving from £21,711m to £11,136m, while non-current liabilities remained relatively stable (£6,047m to £5,997m). Shareholders' equity improved markedly from £1,017m to £3,877m, supported by a turnaround in retained earnings from a negative £466m to a positive £3,274m. The current ratio improved substantially from 95.29% to 144.27%, indicating enhanced liquidity and better short-term financial health. The debt to equity ratio, although still elevated, improved drastically from 2729.40% to 441.91%, reflecting a more balanced capital structure with reduced reliance on debt relative to equity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Centrica's revenue declined sharply by approximately 24.8% to £19,913 million in 2024 from £26,458 million in 2023. Despite this, gross profit dropped more steeply by 57.5% to £4,087 million, resulting in a gross margin contraction from 59.99% to 42.45%. Operating income fell drastically by 73.9% to £1,703 million, with operating margin compressing from 24.61% to 8.55%. Net profit also declined by 66.2% to £1,365 million, with net profit margin halving to 6.85%. Return on equity and return on assets decreased substantially to 32.90% and 6.81% respectively, from 165.10% and 16.03% in 2023, indicating diminished earnings quality and profitability. The effective tax rate dropped significantly to 18.70% from 37.59%, which partially cushioned net income. Overall, profitability weakened markedly in 2024, reflecting lower revenues and margin pressures. | Centrica plc's profitability improved significantly in 2023. Revenue increased by approximately 11.4% from £23,741m to £26,458m. Gross profit surged from £2,045m to £9,623m, lifting the gross margin from 46.80% to 59.99%, indicating better cost management or favorable pricing. Operating income turned positive at £6,512m compared to a loss of £240m in 2022, with operating margin improving from -1.01% to 24.61%. Net profit swung from a loss of £636m to a robust profit of £4,040m, resulting in a net profit margin of 15.27% versus -2.68% previously. Income before taxes rose sharply to £6,473m from a loss of £383m, though the effective tax rate shifted from a high positive 66.06% in 2022 to a negative rate of -37.59% in 2023, suggesting tax benefits or credits impacting earnings quality. Return on equity and assets were strong at 165.10% and 16.03%, respectively, reflecting efficient use of capital and assets to generate earnings. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost of goods sold increased to £11,460 million in 2024 from £10,585 million in 2023 despite lower revenues, indicating cost pressures or less efficient cost control. Operating expenses decreased to £2,640 million from £3,319 million, showing some expense management. Asset turnover slightly declined to 99.32% from 104.98%, suggesting marginally less efficient asset utilization. Net cash from operations dropped significantly to £1,149 million from £2,752 million, reflecting reduced cash generation capacity. Inventories decreased to £904 million from £1,079 million, which may indicate tighter inventory management. Overall, operational efficiency weakened due to higher relative costs and lower cash flow generation, though some expense control was evident. | Operational efficiency improved markedly in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased from -£12,630m to -£10,585m despite higher revenue, contributing to a higher gross margin. Operating expenses increased from -£2,378m to -£3,319m, but this was more than offset by the substantial increase in gross profit. Asset turnover was very high at 104.98%, indicating excellent utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations more than doubled from £1,314m to £2,752m, reflecting strong cash generation from core business activities. Inventories slightly decreased from £1,269m to £1,079m, suggesting effective inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets and current liabilities both decreased, but the current ratio increase indicates better short-term asset coverage. Overall, cash flow from operations supports operational sustainability and growth. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage decreased as evidenced by a lower debt to equity ratio of 314.81% compared to 441.91% in 2023, reducing financial risk. The current ratio improved to 158.89%, indicating stronger liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense slightly increased to £337 million from £308 million, but interest coverage ratio remained robust at 505.34%, down from an exceptionally high 2114.29%, still indicating strong ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate halved to 18.70%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially impacting future tax liabilities. The significant decline in profitability and cash flow generation poses operational risk. Overall, financial risk is moderated by improved liquidity and reduced leverage, but profitability and cash flow declines warrant caution. | Financial risk indicators improved significantly in 2023. The debt to equity ratio, while still high at 441.91%, improved substantially from 2729.40%, indicating reduced leverage risk. Interest expense increased from -£220m to -£308m, but interest coverage ratio improved dramatically from a negative -109.09% to a very strong 2114.29%, showing the company’s enhanced ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio rising to 144.27%. The effective tax rate turned negative at -37.59%, which may indicate tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces some uncertainty in tax expense predictability. No other explicit financial risks such as large non-current liabilities increases or cash flow deficits were observed. Overall, the company’s financial risk profile has improved but leverage remains a consideration. |
| Future financial performance projection | Net cash from investing activities increased to £493 million from £115 million, indicating higher investment activity which may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities outflow increased slightly to £1,548 million from £1,414 million, with dividends rising to £219 million from £186 million, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings. Revenue declines were broad-based across key segments and geographies, with UK revenue dropping from £22,207 million to £16,240 million and all major product lines showing reduced sales except Upstream which slightly increased. This signals potential challenges in core markets. The sustainability of cash flows is under pressure given lower operational cash generation. The company’s investment and dividend policies indicate a focus on maintaining growth and shareholder value, but ongoing margin and revenue pressures may constrain future financial performance. | Centrica plc’s future financial performance appears promising based on 2023 data. Net cash from investing activities turned positive at £115m compared to an outflow of -£566m in 2022, suggesting either asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures, which may impact future growth investments. Net cash from financing activities increased outflow to -£1,414m from -£917m, possibly reflecting debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends paid increased to £186m from £59m, indicating a more confident dividend policy supported by strong earnings and cash flow. Revenue growth was driven by key segments such as British Gas Energy (£17,742m, up from £13,096m) and Centrica Business Solutions (£3,516m, up from £2,981m), while Centrica Energy revenue declined significantly (£7,256m from £14,222m), signaling a possible strategic shift or market conditions affecting this segment. Geographic revenue growth was strong in the UK (£22,207m from £17,480m) and Europe excluding UK and Ireland (£1,733m from £1,473m), but declined in the rest of the world (£1,080m from £2,598m). The strong operational cash flow and improved profitability support sustainable dividend payments and potential for reinvestment, though the reduction in investing outflows may warrant monitoring for future growth prospects. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Centrica faces market risks including commodity price volatility impacting energy procurement, production, generation, and trading activities. The Group is exposed to fluctuations in UK and European gas and power prices, oil, emissions, and North American gas prices. Volumetric risk arises from uncertain consumption profiles due to weather, customer behavior, and economic conditions. Competition in retail markets and evolving customer demand patterns also pose risks. Geopolitical tensions, energy transition speed, and technological innovation influence market conditions. The Group manages these risks through risk capital limits, Value at Risk (VaR), volumetric and stop-loss limits, and regular stress and scenario testing. Hedging policies and risk limits are reviewed bi-annually, with oversight by dedicated Risk Committees. The Group also monitors credit risk exposures and liquidity positions, maintaining committed credit facilities and a US Commercial Paper programme to support funding.
