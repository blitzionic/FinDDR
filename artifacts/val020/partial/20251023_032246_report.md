# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Centrica plc's revenue declined significantly from £33,637m in 2022 to £26,458m in 2023, and further to £19,913m in 2024, indicating a sharp downward trend over the three years. Despite this, gross profit showed volatility, rising from £2,045m in 2022 to £9,623m in 2023 before dropping to £4,087m in 2024. Correspondingly, gross margin decreased from 62.45% in 2022 to 61.51% in 2023 and then sharply to 43.23% in 2024, reflecting deteriorating cost efficiency relative to revenue. By product/service, British Gas Energy remained the largest revenue contributor but fell from £17,742m in 2023 to £12,065m in 2024, while Centrica Energy saw a steep decline from £14,222m in 2022 to £5,723m in 2024. Geographically, UK revenue dropped from £22,207m in 2023 to £16,240m in 2024, with other regions also showing declines or shifts, indicating broad-based revenue contraction across products and regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from a negative (0.71%) in 2022 to a strong 24.61% in 2023 but then declined sharply to 8.55% in 2024, signaling a loss of operating efficiency after a peak year. Operating income followed a similar pattern, moving from a loss of £240m in 2022 to a profit of £6,512m in 2023, then falling to £1,703m in 2024, despite revenue declines. Operating expenses decreased from £3,319m in 2023 to £2,640m in 2024, showing some cost management, but not enough to offset the revenue and gross profit declines. The ratio of operating income to revenue was 24.61% in 2023 but dropped to 8.55% in 2024, indicating that cost controls were insufficient to maintain prior profitability levels. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed significant volatility, with a high positive rate of 66.06% in 2022, a negative rate of (37.59%) in 2023, and a negative rate of (18.70%) in 2024, suggesting substantial tax credits or adjustments impacting net profitability. This contributed to net profit margin swings from a negative (1.89%) in 2022 to a strong 15.27% in 2023, then down to 6.85% in 2024. Non-recurring items are not explicitly listed in the data, but the large swings in tax rates and net profit imply possible one-off tax benefits or charges. No other external factors explicitly affecting profitability are provided. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Centrica plc's total assets decreased to £18,733 million from £21,366 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction in the asset base. Current assets declined to £14,144 million, and non-current assets also reduced to £4,589 million. Total liabilities fell to £13,921 million from £17,133 million, with both current liabilities (£8,902 million) and non-current liabilities (£5,019 million) decreasing. Shareholders' equity increased to £4,422 million from £3,877 million, supported by higher retained earnings (£3,979 million vs. £3,274 million). The current ratio improved to 158.89% from 144.27%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved significantly to 314.81% from 441.91%, suggesting a reduction in leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company shows a healthier balance sheet with reduced liabilities and improved equity, alongside better liquidity and lower leverage in 2024. | In 2023, Centrica plc's total assets decreased significantly to £21,366 million from £29,038 million in 2022, driven by reductions in both current assets (£16,066 million vs. £20,688 million) and non-current assets (£5,300 million vs. £8,350 million). Total liabilities also declined markedly to £17,133 million from £27,758 million, with current liabilities nearly halving to £11,136 million from £21,711 million, while non-current liabilities remained relatively stable (£5,997 million vs. £6,047 million). Shareholders' equity improved substantially to £3,877 million from £1,017 million, reflecting a stronger capital base. The current ratio improved from 95.29% to 144.27%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased sharply from 2729.40% to 441.91%, signaling a significant reduction in leverage and a healthier capital structure. Overall, the company shows improved financial health with stronger equity, reduced liabilities, and better liquidity in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Centrica's revenue declined notably by approximately 24.7% to £19,913 million in 2024 from £26,458 million in 2023. Despite this, cost of goods sold increased to £11,304 million from £10,185 million, causing gross profit to drop sharply to £4,087 million from £9,623 million. Gross margin contracted from 61.51% to 43.23%. Operating expenses decreased to £2,640 million from £3,319 million, but operating income fell drastically to £1,703 million from £6,512 million, with operating margin compressing from 24.61% to 8.55%. Net profit declined to £1,365 million from £4,040 million, and net profit margin dropped from 15.27% to 6.85%. Return on equity and return on assets also deteriorated significantly to 32.90% and 6.81%, respectively, from 165.10% and 16.03%. The effective tax rate halved to 18.70% from 37.59%, partially mitigating the earnings decline. Overall, profitability and earnings quality weakened substantially in 2024, reflecting lower revenues, margin compression, and reduced returns. | Centrica plc demonstrated a remarkable turnaround in profitability in 2023. Revenue declined by approximately 21% to £26,458 million from £33,637 million in 2022, yet gross profit surged to £9,623 million from £2,045 million, reflecting improved cost management or pricing. Gross margin remained stable at around 61.51% compared to 62.45% in 2022. Operating income swung from a loss of £240 million to a strong profit of £6,512 million, with operating margin improving dramatically from negative 0.71% to 24.61%. Net profit turned positive at £4,040 million from a loss of £636 million, yielding a net profit margin of 15.27% versus a negative 1.89% previously. Return on equity was robust at 165.10%, and return on assets stood at 16.03%, both indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of capital and assets. The effective tax rate was negative at -37.59%, a significant change from 66.06% in 2022, which may reflect tax benefits or adjustments impacting net income positively. Interest coverage improved dramatically to 2114.29% from a negative figure, indicating strong ability to cover interest expenses. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency indicators show mixed trends in 2024. Cost control improved as operating expenses decreased by about 20% to £2,640 million, despite higher cost of goods sold. Asset turnover slightly declined to 99.32% from 104.98%, indicating marginally less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations dropped sharply to £1,149 million from £2,752 million, signaling weaker cash generation from core activities. Inventories decreased to £904 million from £1,079 million, suggesting tighter inventory management. Net cash from investing activities increased to £493 million from £115 million, indicating higher investment outflows or asset purchases. Net cash from financing activities outflow increased to £1,548 million from £1,414 million, reflecting higher financing costs or repayments. The net increase in cash was minimal at £94 million compared to £1,453 million in 2023. Overall, operational efficiency weakened in cash generation and asset utilization, though cost control and inventory management showed improvement. | Operational efficiency improved notably in 2023. Despite a revenue decline, gross profit increased substantially, indicating better cost control or product mix. Operating expenses rose to £3,319 million from £2,378 million, but this was more than offset by the increase in gross profit, resulting in a strong operating income. Asset turnover was high at 104.98%, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations more than doubled to £2,752 million from £1,314 million, reflecting improved cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased slightly to £1,079 million from £1,269 million, indicating effective inventory management. Net cash from investing activities turned positive at £115 million compared to an outflow of £566 million in 2022, suggesting either asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. However, net cash from financing activities increased in outflow to £1,414 million from £917 million, possibly due to higher dividend payments (£186 million vs. £59 million) or debt repayments. Overall, operational efficiency and cash flow generation improved significantly in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators improved in 2024. The debt to equity ratio decreased significantly to 314.81% from 441.91%, reducing financial leverage risk. The current ratio improved to 158.89% from 144.27%, enhancing liquidity risk profile. Interest expense slightly increased to £337 million from £308 million, but interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 505.34%, down from an exceptionally high 2114.29%, indicating ample earnings to cover interest obligations despite the decline. The effective tax rate dropped to 18.70% from 37.59%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, potentially reducing tax-related risks. However, the sharp decline in profitability and cash from operations could pose early warning signs for sustainability of earnings and liquidity if trends continue. Overall, leverage and liquidity risks have moderated, but profitability and cash flow declines warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators improved substantially in 2023. The debt to equity ratio decreased sharply from 2729.40% to 441.91%, indicating a significant reduction in leverage and lower financial risk. The current ratio increased to 144.27% from 95.29%, enhancing liquidity and the ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense increased slightly to £308 million from £220 million, but interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 2114.29% from a negative figure, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest costs and reduced risk of default. The effective tax rate shifted from a high positive 66.06% to a negative -37.59%, which may indicate tax credits or deferred tax assets, but also introduces some uncertainty in tax expense predictability. Overall, the company’s financial risk profile improved with lower leverage, stronger liquidity, and robust interest coverage, though the unusual tax rate warrants monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Centrica's increased net cash used in investing activities (£493 million vs. £115 million) suggests a higher level of investment activity in 2024, which may support future growth. The company maintained dividend payments, increasing slightly to £219 million from £186 million, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings. Revenue declines were broad-based across key segments and geographies, with UK revenue falling from £22,207 million to £16,240 million and all major product lines showing reduced sales except for a slight increase in Upstream revenue (£1,607 million vs. £1,505 million). The modest net increase in cash (£94 million) and reduced cash from operations raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. The improved capital structure and liquidity provide a buffer for future challenges. Overall, while investment and dividend policies remain active, the company faces headwinds from declining revenues and cash flow, suggesting cautious outlook with potential for recovery if investments yield returns and operational performance stabilizes. | Centrica plc’s future financial performance appears promising based on 2023 data. The company generated strong net cash from operations (£2,752 million), supporting cash flow sustainability. Positive net cash from investing activities (£115 million) suggests potential asset sales or reduced capital expenditure, which may free up cash for other uses. However, net cash from financing activities showed increased outflows (£1,414 million), including higher dividends (£186 million), indicating a commitment to returning value to shareholders but also a need to balance financing needs. Revenue by segment shows growth in British Gas Energy (£17,742 million vs. £13,096 million) and Centrica Business Solutions (£3,516 million vs. £2,981 million), while Centrica Energy revenue declined (£7,256 million vs. £14,222 million), signaling a shift in business focus or market conditions. Geographic revenue growth in the UK (£22,207 million vs. £17,480 million) and Europe (excluding UK and Ireland) suggests strong market presence. These trends, combined with improved profitability and liquidity, indicate a solid foundation for future growth, though monitoring segment shifts and capital allocation will be critical. |
