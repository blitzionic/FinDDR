## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 saw a decline from $5,431 million to $3,751 million, a drop of approximately 30.9%. However, there was a significant recovery in 2024, with revenue increasing to $6,226 million, representing a growth of 66.5% from 2023. The gross margin showed a downward trend, decreasing from 47.62% in 2022 to 37.16% in 2023, before slightly recovering to 41.97% in 2024. In terms of product revenue, crude oil sales increased from $2,086 million in 2023 to $2,878 million in 2024, while gas sales surged from $1,415 million to $2,936 million in the same period. The geographic revenue distribution shifted significantly, with the UK contributing $3,917 million in 2024, a notable increase from the North Sea's $3,478 million in 2023, while Norway generated $1,465 million in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin trends indicate a decline from 46.79% in 2022 to 24.34% in 2023, followed by a slight recovery to 26.47% in 2024. Operating income decreased significantly from $2,541 million in 2022 to $913 million in 2023, but rebounded to $1,648 million in 2024. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that while revenue dropped in 2023, operating income was disproportionately affected, indicating potential inefficiencies. Operating expenses increased from $121 million in 2022 to $149 million in 2023 and further to $352 million in 2024, suggesting challenges in cost management despite the revenue recovery. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate experienced a significant increase from 99.68% in 2022 to 94.64% in 2023, and further to 107.63% in 2024, indicating a potential issue with tax liabilities or adjustments. This high tax rate has contributed to the net profit margin remaining low, with a net profit of -$93 million in 2024 compared to $32 million in 2023 and $8 million in 2022. There are no specific non-recurring items mentioned, but the drastic changes in tax rates and net profit suggest external factors, possibly regulatory changes or market conditions, affecting overall profitability. |
