# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 saw a decline from 5431 to 3751, representing a decrease of approximately 30.9%. However, there was a significant rebound in 2024, with revenue increasing to 6226, marking a growth of 65.9% from 2023. The gross margin showed a notable fluctuation, with 2022 at 152.38%, peaking in 2023 at 162.84%, and then dropping to 41.97% in 2024. This indicates a potential issue in cost management or pricing strategy in 2024. Revenue by product/service in 2024 shows a strong performance in Gas ($2,936m) and Crude oil ($2,878m), with both categories experiencing growth from 2023. Geographic revenue distribution in 2024 indicates a diversified portfolio, with the UK leading at $3,917m, followed by Norway at $1,465m, showcasing a shift from 2023 where the UK was the only significant contributor. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin trends indicate a decline from 46.79% in 2022 to 24.34% in 2023, followed by a slight recovery to 26.47% in 2024. This suggests that while operating efficiency improved slightly in 2024, it remains significantly lower than 2022 levels. The operating income decreased from 2541 in 2022 to 913 in 2023, before recovering to 1648 in 2024, indicating a volatile relationship between operating income and revenue. The effectiveness of cost management appears to have deteriorated, particularly in 2023, as evidenced by the negative cost of goods sold in that year, which may have distorted the gross profit calculations. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has shown significant volatility, increasing from 99.68% in 2022 to 94.64% in 2023, and then surging to 107.63% in 2024. This unusual pattern suggests potential non-recurring tax impacts or adjustments that could be affecting net profitability. The net profit margin has also fluctuated, with a slight increase from 0.15% in 2022 to 0.85% in 2023, but then dropping to -1.49% in 2024, indicating that external factors, possibly including tax liabilities and operational challenges, have adversely impacted profitability in the latest year. |

The debt to equity ratio improved to 385.06%, but the high level of debt still poses a financial risk. | In 2023, the effective tax rate was 94.64%, which was relatively high and could indicate tax management challenges. The interest coverage ratio was 2173.81%, reflecting a strong ability to cover interest expenses. The current ratio was at 82.10%, indicating a stable liquidity position, but the high debt to equity ratio of 542.66% raised concerns about financial risk and reliance on debt financing. |
| Future financial performance projection | Based on the 2024 data, the company is positioned for potential growth with significant revenue increases, particularly in crude oil and gas segments. However, the negative net profit indicates that cost management and operational efficiency need to be prioritized to ensure sustainable cash flow. The investment activities, reflected in net cash from investing at -$2,277 million, suggest aggressive expansion, but this must be balanced with cash flow sustainability. The dividend policy remains stable with dividends of $199 million, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns despite current challenges. | In 2023, the company faced challenges with declining revenue and profitability, which could hinder future growth. The net cash from investing was -$693 million, indicating a cautious approach to investment activities. The dividend policy remained stable with dividends of $190 million, reflecting a commitment to shareholders despite the financial pressures.
