# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue showed a volatile trend with a decline from 2022 ($5,431m) to 2023 ($3,751m), a drop of approximately 30.9%, followed by a strong recovery in 2024 to $6,226m, a 65.9% increase from 2023. Gross margin percentages are unusually high in 2022 (152.38%) and 2023 (162.84%), then normalize to 41.97% in 2024, indicating possible data inconsistencies or extraordinary cost accounting in earlier years. Revenue by product/service in 2024 is nearly evenly split between Crude oil ($2,878m) and Gas ($2,936m), with smaller contributions from Condensate ($283m), Tariff income and other revenue ($61m), and Other income ($68m). Compared to 2023, Crude oil revenue increased by 38% and Gas revenue more than doubled (107.4%), showing strong growth in gas sales. Geographically, 2024 revenue is concentrated in the UK ($3,917m, 62.9% of total) and Norway ($1,465m, 23.5%), with smaller contributions from Germany, Argentina, Southeast Asia, North Africa, and Mexico. In 2023, revenue was almost entirely from the UK ($3,529m, 94%) and Southeast Asia ($237m, 6.3%), with no reported revenue from Norway or other regions, indicating significant geographic expansion or reporting changes in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from a high 46.79% in 2022 to 24.34% in 2023, then slightly improved to 26.47% in 2024. Operating income fell sharply from $2,541m in 2022 to $913m in 2023 (-64.1%), then rebounded to $1,648m in 2024 (+80.5% from 2023). Despite revenue recovery in 2024, operating margin remains significantly below 2022 levels, suggesting increased operating expenses or cost pressures. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that while revenue in 2024 exceeded 2022 levels, operating income did not fully recover, indicating less efficient cost management or higher operating costs. Cost of goods sold decreased from $2,845m in 2022 to $2,357m in 2023, then increased to $3,613m in 2024, consistent with revenue trends but contributing to margin compression in 2024 compared to 2022. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate is exceptionally high and increasing: 99.68% in 2022, 94.64% in 2023, and 107.63% in 2024, indicating that tax expenses nearly equal or exceed pre-tax profits, severely impacting net profitability. This is reflected in net profit margins which are very low or negative: 0.15% in 2022, 0.85% in 2023, and negative (1.49%) in 2024, with net profit turning negative at -$93m in 2024 despite positive operating income. The large income tax expense in 2024 ($1,312m) compared to operating income ($1,648m) suggests significant non-recurring tax charges or adjustments. No explicit non-recurring items are reported, but the tax and net profit patterns imply unusual or one-off tax impacts. External factors such as geographic expansion and product mix changes may have influenced profitability and tax liabilities. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company exhibits significant asset growth with total assets increasing sharply from $9,897 million in 2023 to $30,321 million, driven primarily by a rise in non-current assets from $8,081 million to $26,410 million. Total liabilities also increased substantially from $8,357 million to $24,070 million, with both current liabilities and non-current liabilities more than doubling. Despite this, shareholders' equity improved markedly from $1,540 million to $6,251 million, indicating a stronger equity base. The current ratio declined from 82.10% to 69.67%, suggesting a slight weakening in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved from 542.66% to 385.06%, reflecting better leverage management though still indicating a high reliance on debt. Overall, the balance sheet shows robust growth but with increased leverage and somewhat reduced liquidity. | In 2023, the company experienced a contraction in total assets, declining from $12,566 million in 2022 to $9,897 million, indicating a reduction in asset base by approximately 21.3%. Both current assets and non-current assets decreased, with current assets falling from $2,127 million to $1,816 million and non-current assets from $10,439 million to $8,081 million. Total liabilities also decreased significantly from $11,545 million to $8,357 million, driven by reductions in both current liabilities (from $4,096 million to $2,212 million) and non-current liabilities (from $7,449 million to $6,145 million). Shareholders' equity improved from $1,021 million to $1,540 million, reflecting a stronger equity position despite a decline in retained earnings from $1,456 million to $1,080 million. The current ratio improved markedly from 51.93% to 82.10%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio halved from 1,130.75% to 542.66%, signaling a significant deleveraging and improved capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet shows a stronger equity base, reduced leverage, and improved liquidity, although the asset base has contracted notably in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue surged by 65.9% from $3,751 million in 2023 to $6,226 million in 2024, reflecting strong top-line growth across all product lines and geographic regions. Operating income increased by 80.5% to $1,648 million, improving the operating margin slightly from 24.34% to 26.47%, indicating effective cost control at the operating level. However, net profit turned negative, with a net loss of $93 million in 2024 compared to a net profit of $32 million in 2023, resulting in a negative net profit margin of (1.49)%. This deterioration is largely due to a sharp increase in income tax expense from $565 million to $1,312 million, pushing the effective tax rate above 100% at 107.63%. Return on equity and return on assets both turned negative, at (2.39)% and (0.46)% respectively, signaling challenges in earnings sustainability despite revenue and operating income growth. | Revenue declined sharply by approximately 30.9%, from $5,431 million in 2022 to $3,751 million in 2023. Cost of goods sold also decreased from $2,845 million to $2,357 million. Despite the revenue decline, gross margin improved from 152.38% to 162.84%, suggesting better cost efficiency or pricing power at the gross profit level. Operating income dropped significantly from $2,541 million to $913 million, causing the operating margin to fall from 46.79% to 24.34%. Net profit increased from $8 million to $32 million, improving the net profit margin from 0.15% to 0.85%, indicating better bottom-line profitability despite lower revenues. Income before taxes decreased from $2,462 million to $597 million, and the effective tax rate remained very high but slightly improved from 99.68% to 94.64%. Return on equity and return on assets were positive in 2023 at 2.50% and 0.28%, respectively, indicating modest earnings sustainability. Overall, profitability weakened at the operating level but improved at the net level, with margins showing mixed trends and returns remaining low but positive. |
| Operational efficiency | The operating margin improved slightly to 26.47% in 2024 from 24.34% in 2023, indicating better control over operating expenses relative to revenue. Asset turnover decreased marginally from 33.40% to 30.96%, suggesting a slight decline in how efficiently assets generate revenue. Net cash from operations declined from $2,144 million to $1,615 million, indicating reduced cash generation despite higher revenues. Inventories increased from $200 million to $368 million, which may imply higher working capital requirements. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with improved margins but lower asset utilization and cash flow from operations. | Operating margin declined from 46.79% in 2022 to 24.34% in 2023, reflecting increased operating costs relative to revenue or reduced operational efficiency. Asset turnover was high at 33.40 in 2023 (no prior year data), indicating strong utilization of assets to generate revenue despite the asset base contraction. Net cash from operations decreased from $3,130 million to $2,144 million, consistent with lower revenue and operating income. Working capital, as indicated by current assets and liabilities, improved liquidity but with a reduction in absolute current assets and liabilities. Inventories increased from $143 million to $200 million, which may suggest stockpiling or slower inventory turnover. Overall, operational efficiency shows a decline in operating margin and cash flow generation but strong asset turnover, indicating effective use of assets despite cost pressures. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remains high though improved, with the debt to equity ratio decreasing from 542.66% to 385.06%, indicating continued significant reliance on debt financing. Interest expense nearly doubled from $42 million to $78 million, but interest coverage remains very strong at 2,112.82%, only slightly lower than 2023's 2,173.81%, suggesting the company can comfortably meet interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased substantially to 107.63%, which is an unusual and potentially risky tax environment impacting net profitability. The current ratio declined to 69.67%, indicating tighter liquidity. These factors combined suggest moderate financial risk with strong interest coverage but high leverage and tax-related profitability risks. | Leverage decreased substantially as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio dropping from 1,130.75% to 542.66%, reducing financial risk. The current ratio improved from 51.93% to 82.10%, enhancing liquidity risk profile. Interest expense was $42 million in 2023, with an exceptionally high interest coverage ratio of 2,173.81%, indicating strong ability to cover interest payments from operating income. The effective tax rate remained very high at 94.64%, which could pose a risk to net profitability sustainability. The reduction in liabilities and improved liquidity ratios suggest a lower risk of financial distress. However, the high tax burden and reduced operating income may warrant monitoring. No data on interest expense or coverage was available for 2022 for comparison. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities intensified in 2024, with net cash used in investing activities increasing from $(693) million to $(2,277) million, signaling aggressive capital expenditure or acquisitions to support growth. Net cash from financing activities turned positive at $1,229 million compared to $(1,667) million in 2023, indicating new financing inflows possibly to fund investments. The company maintained dividend payments with a slight increase from $(190) million to $(199) million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite net losses. Revenue growth was broad-based across products and geographies, notably with new or increased contributions from Norway, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, and North Africa, suggesting geographic diversification and growth potential. Cash flow sustainability may be pressured by lower operational cash flow and high investing outflows, but financing inflows and strong operating margins provide some support for future performance. | Investment activities in 2023 show net cash outflow from investing of $693 million, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting future growth. Net cash from financing activities was negative at $1,667 million, less than the $2,674 million outflow in 2022, suggesting reduced debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends remained stable at approximately $190 million, indicating a consistent dividend policy despite lower earnings. Revenue concentration in 2023 was primarily from the UK ($3,529 million) and crude oil ($2,086 million) and gas ($1,415 million) product lines, with minor contributions from Southeast Asia and corporate segments. The absence of revenue from Norway, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, North Africa, and CCS suggests geographic concentration risk but also potential for future expansion. The cash flow from operations remains positive but reduced, which may constrain growth unless investment returns improve. Overall, the company is investing in growth while maintaining dividends, with geographic and product concentration that may influence future performance. |
