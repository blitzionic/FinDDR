# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Harbour Energy plc's revenue showed a fluctuating trend from 2022 to 2024, decreasing from $5,390 million in 2022 to $3,751 million in 2023, then sharply increasing to $6,226 million in 2024. Gross margin followed a similar pattern, declining from 47.22% in 2022 to 36.66% in 2023 before recovering to 41.97% in 2024, indicating some volatility in cost control relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service reveals a shift with crude oil sales decreasing from $2,792 million in 2022 to $2,086 million in 2023, then rising to $2,878 million in 2024, while gas sales dropped significantly in 2023 to $1,415 million from $2,322 million in 2022 but rebounded to $2,936 million in 2024. Condensate sales and other income streams showed smaller fluctuations. Geographically, the UK remained the dominant revenue source, increasing from $3,529 million in 2023 to $3,917 million in 2024, with Norway contributing $1,465 million in 2024 (not reported in 2023), and other regions like Germany, Mexico, Argentina, North Africa, and Southeast Asia contributing smaller but notable amounts in 2024, reflecting geographic diversification compared to the 2022 North Sea and International split. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from a strong 47.14% in 2022 to 24.85% in 2023, then slightly improved to 26.47% in 2024, indicating reduced operating efficiency compared to 2022. Operating income decreased sharply from $2,541 million in 2022 to $932 million in 2023, then increased to $1,648 million in 2024, but still remained below the 2022 level despite higher revenue in 2024. Operating expenses rose from $121 million in 2022 to $149 million in 2023 and further to $352 million in 2024, suggesting increased cost pressures or investments that outpaced revenue growth in 2023 and 2024. The widening gap between operating income and revenue, especially the drop in operating margin, points to challenges in cost management and operational efficiency despite revenue recovery in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed significant negative values in 2023 and 2024, at (92.69%) and (107.63%) respectively, compared to a positive 99.68% in 2022, indicating substantial tax benefits or credits impacting profitability. This shift contributed to the net profit turning negative in 2024 at ($93) million despite positive operating income, reflecting the strong influence of tax-related items. Income tax expense figures of ($571) million in 2023 and ($1,312) million in 2024 contrast with a positive $2,454 million in 2022, confirming the impact of tax adjustments. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors were listed in the provided data, so the tax effects appear to be the primary external influence on profitability during this period. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Harbour Energy plc demonstrated a significant expansion in its financial base with total assets increasing sharply from $9,897 million in 2023 to $30,321 million. This growth was driven primarily by a rise in non-current assets from $8,081 million to $26,410 million, indicating substantial investment in long-term assets. Total liabilities also increased markedly from $8,357 million to $24,070 million, with both current liabilities ($2,212 million to $5,614 million) and non-current liabilities ($6,145 million to $18,456 million) rising substantially. Despite this, shareholders' equity improved from $1,540 million to $6,251 million, reflecting stronger net asset value. The current ratio decreased from 82.10% to 69.67%, suggesting a slight decline in short-term liquidity but still maintaining a reasonable buffer. The debt to equity ratio improved from 542.66% to 385.06%, indicating a reduction in leverage relative to equity, though the company remains highly leveraged. Overall, Harbour Energy's capital structure in 2024 shows aggressive asset growth funded by increased liabilities but with improved equity base and moderate liquidity pressure. | In 2023, Harbour Energy plc's total assets decreased significantly to $9,897 million from $12,566 million in 2022, reflecting a contraction in the asset base. Both current assets and non-current assets declined, with current assets falling from $2,127 million to $1,816 million and non-current assets from $10,439 million to $8,081 million. Total liabilities also reduced markedly from $11,545 million to $8,357 million, driven by decreases in both current liabilities (from $4,096 million to $2,212 million) and non-current liabilities (from $7,449 million to $6,145 million). Shareholders' equity improved from $1,021 million to $1,540 million, indicating a stronger equity base despite lower retained earnings ($1,080 million in 2023 vs. $1,456 million in 2022). The current ratio improved from 51.93% to 82.10%, suggesting better short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio halved from 1130.75% to 542.66%, indicating a significant deleveraging and a more balanced capital structure. Overall, the company shows improved financial health with reduced leverage and enhanced liquidity, though the asset base has contracted notably. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Harbour Energy's revenue surged by 65.9% from $3,751 million in 2023 to $6,226 million in 2024, driven by increases across all product lines and geographic regions. Gross profit nearly doubled from $1,375 million to $2,613 million, improving the gross margin from 36.66% to 41.97%, reflecting better cost absorption or pricing power. Operating income rose from $932 million to $1,648 million, lifting the operating margin slightly from 24.85% to 26.47%. However, net profit turned negative, with a loss of $93 million in 2024 compared to a modest profit of $45 million in 2023, resulting in a negative net profit margin of (1.49)%. This discrepancy is largely due to a significant increase in income tax expense from $(571) million to $(1,312) million, and a rise in interest expense from $42 million to $78 million, despite income before taxes doubling from $616 million to $1,219 million. Return on equity and return on assets both turned negative in 2024, at (2.39)% and (0.46)% respectively, indicating diminished earnings quality and challenges in converting higher revenues into net profitability. | Harbour Energy plc experienced a decline in revenue in 2023 to $3,751 million from $5,390 million in 2022, a decrease of approximately 30%. This revenue contraction was accompanied by a sharper decline in gross profit, which dropped to $1,375 million from $2,545 million, causing the gross margin to fall from 47.22% to 36.66%. Operating income also declined substantially to $932 million from $2,541 million, with the operating margin decreasing from 47.14% to 24.85%. Despite these declines, net profit improved to $45 million from a marginal $8 million in 2022, resulting in a net profit margin increase from 0.15% to 1.20%. The income tax expense shifted dramatically from a charge of $2,454 million in 2022 to a tax benefit of $571 million in 2023, leading to a negative effective tax rate of -92.69%. Interest expense decreased significantly to $42 million from $358 million, improving interest coverage from 709.78% to 2219.05%. Return on equity and return on assets were positive in 2023 at 3.51% and 0.40%, respectively, indicating modest profitability relative to equity and assets. Overall, profitability margins contracted due to lower revenues and gross profit, but net profitability improved due to tax benefits and lower interest costs, enhancing earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, Harbour Energy's cost of goods sold increased from $2,376 million to $3,613 million, but at a slower rate than revenue, improving gross margin. Operating expenses more than doubled from $149 million to $352 million, which slightly pressured operating efficiency but was offset by revenue growth. Asset turnover declined from 33.40% to 30.96%, indicating a slight reduction in how efficiently assets generate revenue, possibly due to the large asset base expansion. Net cash from operations decreased from $2,144 million to $1,615 million, reflecting lower cash generation despite higher revenues, which may be linked to working capital changes or operational cash flow timing. Inventories increased from $200 million to $368 million, suggesting higher stock levels. Overall, while cost control appears challenged with rising operating expenses, Harbour Energy maintains solid operational cash flow, though with some efficiency dilution due to asset growth. | Operational efficiency in 2023 shows mixed results. Cost of goods sold decreased to $2,376 million from $2,845 million, but the gross margin declined, indicating cost reductions did not fully offset revenue declines. Operating expenses increased slightly to $149 million from $121 million, suggesting some cost pressure. Asset turnover was high at 33.40%, indicating effective utilization of assets to generate revenue despite the smaller asset base. Net cash from operations decreased to $2,144 million from $3,130 million, reflecting lower operational cash generation aligned with reduced revenue. Inventories increased from $143 million to $200 million, which may indicate slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more sharply than current assets, supported by a higher current ratio. Net cash from investing was negative at $693 million, indicating ongoing investment activities. Overall, the company maintained reasonable operational efficiency with strong asset turnover but faced challenges in cash flow generation and cost control amid declining revenues. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show mixed signals. The debt to equity ratio, while improved, remains high at 385.06%, indicating substantial leverage and potential vulnerability to interest rate or credit risks. Interest coverage remains very strong at 2,112.82%, only slightly lower than 2023, suggesting the company can comfortably meet interest obligations despite increased interest expense. The current ratio declined to 69.67%, indicating tighter liquidity but still above critical thresholds. The effective tax rate worsened from (92.69)% to (107.63)%, reflecting a higher tax burden or deferred tax adjustments that negatively impact net income. The negative net profit despite strong operating income and income before taxes signals potential risks in tax management or non-operating expenses. The increase in non-current liabilities and current liabilities also heightens refinancing and liquidity risks. Overall, Harbour Energy faces elevated financial risk from leverage and tax expense volatility, warranting close monitoring. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023. The debt to equity ratio decreased substantially to 542.66% from 1130.75%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. Interest expense dropped sharply to $42 million from $358 million, and interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 2219.05%, suggesting strong ability to service debt. Liquidity improved as the current ratio rose to 82.10% from 51.93%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. However, the effective tax rate swung to a negative -92.69% from nearly 100%, which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces uncertainty in tax expense predictability. The net profit margin remains low at 1.20%, and the company’s net cash from financing activities remains negative at $1,667 million, indicating ongoing cash outflows related to financing. These factors suggest reduced leverage risk but potential volatility in tax and financing cash flows. No other explicit risk factors are evident from the data. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Harbour Energy's substantial increase in non-current assets and significant net cash outflow from investing activities ($2,277 million) in 2024 indicate aggressive investment likely aimed at growth or capacity expansion. The positive net cash from financing of $1,229 million contrasts with 2023's outflow, suggesting new capital raising or debt issuance to support investments. Despite a net loss, the company increased dividends slightly from $190 million to $199 million, signaling confidence in cash flow sustainability and shareholder returns. Revenue diversification improved with new geographic contributions from Norway, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, and North Africa, alongside strong UK sales, which may reduce regional risk and support future growth. However, the decline in net cash from operations and negative net profit margin highlight challenges in profitability sustainability. Overall, Harbour Energy appears positioned for growth with ongoing investments and diversified revenue streams, but must manage profitability and cash flow carefully to sustain dividends and financial health. | Looking ahead, Harbour Energy plc's investment activity remains significant with net cash used in investing at $693 million in 2023, indicating continued capital expenditure or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from operations, while lower than 2022, remains positive at $2,144 million, supporting cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments were stable at $190 million, consistent with prior year, suggesting a maintained dividend policy. Revenue by geographic region shows concentration in the UK at $3,529 million and Southeast Asia at $237 million, with other regions not reported, indicating geographic focus that may influence future performance. Product-wise, crude oil and gas sales remain the primary revenue drivers, though both declined in 2023. The company’s improved equity base and reduced leverage provide a stronger platform for future financial stability. Overall, Harbour Energy appears positioned for moderate growth with ongoing investments and stable dividends, but future performance will depend on market conditions affecting core product sales and geographic exposure. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The company's primary business model is the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and gas reserves and related activities. It generates revenue primarily through the sale of hydrocarbons including crude oil, natural gas, and condensate. Revenue streams include crude oil sales, gas sales (split between European gas and other gas), condensate sales, tariff income, and other income such as partner recoveries and government subsidies. The company operates geographically across nine Business Units (Norway, UK, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, North Africa, Southeast Asia, CCS, and Corporate), with a significant portion of revenue driven by production volumes and commodity prices. The business model also includes active commodity price risk management through hedging strategies. Additionally, the company has a dedicated CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) Business Unit, reflecting investment in low-carbon technologies and clean energy transition opportunities. The company’s revenue increased significantly in 2024 due to the acquisition of the Wintershall Dea asset portfolio, which expanded production and geographic diversity. The company focuses on maintaining a balance of oil and gas production, operational control, and financial discipline to ensure resilience through commodity price cycles. | The company's primary business model is the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and gas reserves and related activities. It generates revenue primarily through the sale of crude oil, natural gas, and condensate. Revenue is recognized from contracts with customers when control of the hydrocarbons transfers, typically at the point of physical delivery. The company operates geographically in two main business units: the North Sea (including the UK and Norwegian continental shelves) and International (including Indonesia, Vietnam, and Mexico). Revenue streams include crude oil sales, gas sales (split between UK natural gas and international gas), condensate sales, tariff income, and other related income such as partner recoveries and receipts from development agreements. The business model emphasizes capital discipline, sustainability, efficient operations to maximize value and cash flow from existing assets, and selective mergers and acquisitions to grow and diversify the portfolio. The company also focuses on strategic supply chain partnerships and cost control to support its operations. |
| Market Position | Following the transformational acquisition of the Wintershall Dea asset portfolio in 2024, the company became one of the world's largest and most geographically diverse independent oil and gas companies, with pro forma production of approximately 475 kboepd and operations in 11 countries. Norway is now the largest producing region in the portfolio, noted for low unit operating costs and a stable fiscal regime.

The company is positioned as a market leader or major player in its key markets, with a balanced portfolio of approximately 40% oil, 40% European natural gas, and 20% other gas. It has a strong competitive advantage through scale, geographic diversity, and a high-quality asset base. The company’s market capitalization as of December 31, 2024, positions it close to entry into the FTSE 100 index, indicating a strong competitive standing among global peers. The company actively competes for global talent and benchmarks itself against FTSE 30-100 companies and international oil and gas peers, reflecting its ambition and scale. It is recognized as a leading player in the European CCS sector, with material participation in key projects such as Viking (UK) and Greensand Future (Denmark). Overall, the company is a market leader with significant scale, geographic diversity, and a resilient portfolio, well positioned for continued growth and competitive shareholder returns. | The company is positioned as a significant player in the upstream oil and gas sector with operations in key regions including the North Sea and international markets such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Mexico. While specific market share percentages are not provided, the company reported production of 186 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboepd) in 2023 and holds 880 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) in 2P reserves plus 2C resources at year-end 2023. The company is pursuing growth and diversification through acquisitions, exemplified by the $11.2 billion acquisition of Wintershall Dea's upstream oil and gas portfolio, described as the largest announced upstream deal outside North America in 2023. This acquisition and the company's strategic focus on M&A position it to enhance scale and market relevance. The company is not explicitly described as a market leader or challenger, but its active participation in record upstream M&A activity and strategic growth initiatives indicate a strong competitive position. The company also emphasizes maintaining a high-quality portfolio, financial discipline, and operational efficiency as competitive advantages. |


# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Harbour Energy plc faces market risks primarily from commodity price fluctuations, interest rate changes, and foreign currency exchange rate volatility. Commodity prices for oil and gas are influenced by global and regional supply and demand, geopolitical conflicts, economic uncertainty, and political instability, leading to price volatility and potential sustained declines that could reduce cash flow and impact the company's ability to fund growth and maintain shareholder distributions. The company manages these risks through a disciplined hedging programme, including fixed price contracts and derivative financial instruments such as swaps and options, with hedging targets set for production years. Foreign currency risk arises mainly from exchange rate movements between the US dollar and other currencies; the company mitigates this by matching financial assets and liabilities to functional currencies and using forward contracts. Interest rate risk relates to floating rate borrowings and is managed through interest rate derivatives. The company also faces risks from changing customer demand due to climate change and energy transition, with potential impacts on long-term oil and gas prices and investor focus on ESG factors. The company actively monitors market developments, adjusts strategy accordingly, and engages in industry representation to manage these risks. | Harbour Energy plc faces market risks primarily from fluctuations in commodity prices (oil and gas), interest rates, and foreign exchange rates, particularly the US dollar against the pound sterling. Commodity price volatility and sustained declines could reduce cash flow, impair access to capital, and affect the company's ability to deliver its strategy. The company manages these risks through a Board-approved commodity hedging program covering 40-70% of year 1 production and lesser percentages in subsequent years, using fixed price contracts and derivative financial instruments such as swaps and options. Foreign currency risk is mitigated by holding financial assets and liabilities in currencies matching the functional currency of entities and using forward contracts to hedge exposures. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring exposure and using interest rate derivatives, although as of 2023, the Group has no floating rate borrowings. The company also faces risks from economic downturns, regional conflicts, political instability, and energy transition impacts on demand and prices. Market conditions for M&A are improving but remain uncertain, with risks related to transaction completion and integration. The company monitors these risks through sensitivity analyses and downside scenario testing to ensure liquidity and covenant compliance. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include failure to maintain safe, reliable, and cost-effective production operations, with uncertainties in forecasting production and operating costs, aging asset base requiring maintenance and replacement parts, and limited opportunities to increase production throughput. The company relies on third parties such as joint venture partners and suppliers, which may not align with Harbour's values or business objectives, potentially affecting asset management and access to transportation or market value realization.
