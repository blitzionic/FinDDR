# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Harbour Energy plc's revenue showed a volatile trend from 2022 to 2024, decreasing from $5,390 million in 2022 to $3,751 million in 2023, then sharply increasing to $6,226 million in 2024. Correspondingly, the gross margin declined from 47.22% in 2022 to 36.66% in 2023, before recovering to 41.97% in 2024, indicating fluctuating cost efficiency relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service in 2024 was almost evenly split between crude oil sales ($2,878 million) and gas sales ($2,936 million), with smaller contributions from condensate ($283 million), tariff income and other revenue ($61 million), and other income ($68 million). Geographically, the UK dominated revenue in 2024 with $3,917 million, followed by Norway at $1,465 million and smaller amounts from Germany, Mexico, Argentina, North Africa, and Southeast Asia. This contrasts with 2023 where UK revenue was $3,529 million and Norway had no reported revenue, indicating geographic expansion or reporting changes in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a declining trend from a high 47.14% in 2022 to 24.85% in 2023, then a slight improvement to 26.47% in 2024, reflecting reduced operating profitability relative to revenue. Operating income decreased sharply from $2,541 million in 2022 to $932 million in 2023, then increased to $1,648 million in 2024, tracking the revenue pattern but at a lower margin. Operating expenses rose from $121 million in 2022 to $149 million in 2023 and further to $352 million in 2024, indicating increased cost pressures or investments that outpaced revenue growth in 2023 but were somewhat offset by revenue gains in 2024. The data suggests that while Harbour Energy improved revenue and gross profit in 2024, operating cost management became more challenging, impacting operating income growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 99.68% in 2022 to 92.69% in 2023 and further to an exceptionally high 107.63% in 2024, which significantly impacted net profitability. Despite positive operating income in 2024 ($1,648 million), the net profit was negative at $(93) million, largely due to the high income tax expense of $1,312 million. This suggests substantial tax-related or other non-operating charges affecting net results. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors are listed in the provided data, but the tax expense and effective tax rate trends indicate external fiscal or regulatory impacts severely constrained net profitability in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Harbour Energy plc demonstrated significant growth in total assets, increasing from $9,916 million in 2023 to $30,321 million, driven primarily by a rise in non-current assets from $8,370 million to $26,410 million. Total liabilities also rose substantially from $8,363 million to $24,070 million, with both current liabilities ($2,016 million to $5,614 million) and non-current liabilities ($6,347 million to $18,456 million) increasing markedly. Shareholders' equity improved from $1,553 million to $6,251 million, reflecting a stronger capital base despite retained earnings declining from $1,093 million to $807 million. The current ratio decreased from 76.69% to 69.67%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved significantly from 538.51% to 385.06%, suggesting a more balanced capital structure but still a high leverage level. Overall, the company expanded its asset base and equity while managing a high but somewhat reduced leverage position and slightly weaker liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, Harbour Energy plc's total assets decreased significantly to $9,916 million from $12,566 million in 2022, reflecting a contraction in the asset base. Both current assets and non-current assets declined, with current assets falling from $2,127 million to $1,546 million and non-current assets from $10,439 million to $8,370 million. Total liabilities also reduced markedly from $11,545 million to $8,363 million, driven by decreases in both current liabilities (from $4,096 million to $2,016 million) and non-current liabilities (from $7,449 million to $6,347 million). Shareholders' equity improved from $1,021 million to $1,553 million, indicating a stronger equity base despite the overall asset contraction. The current ratio improved from 51.93% to 76.69%, suggesting better short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio halved from 1130.75% to 538.51%, indicating a significant reduction in leverage and a more balanced capital structure. Overall, the company shows improved financial health in terms of liquidity and capital structure, despite a smaller asset base in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Harbour Energy's revenue surged by 65.9% from $3,751 million in 2023 to $6,226 million in 2024, driven by increases across all product lines and geographic regions. Gross profit nearly doubled from $1,358 million to $2,613 million, improving the gross margin from 36.66% to 41.97%. Operating income rose from $932 million to $1,648 million, with operating margin increasing from 24.85% to 26.47%, indicating improved operational profitability. However, net profit turned negative, declining from a modest profit of $45 million in 2023 to a loss of $93 million in 2024, resulting in a negative net profit margin of (1.49)%. This was influenced by a sharp increase in income tax expense from $571 million to $1,312 million, pushing the effective tax rate above 100% (107.63%), and higher interest expense rising from $420 million to $602 million. Return on equity and return on assets both turned negative, from 3.50% to (2.38%) and 0.40% to (0.46%) respectively, reflecting the net loss and increased asset base. Earnings quality is impacted by the tax burden and interest costs despite strong top-line and operating profit growth. | Harbour Energy plc experienced a notable decline in revenue in 2023, dropping to $3,751 million from $5,390 million in 2022, a decrease of approximately 30%. Correspondingly, gross profit fell sharply to $1,358 million from $2,545 million, with the gross margin contracting from 47.22% to 36.66%, indicating reduced profitability at the core production level. Operating income also declined significantly to $932 million from $2,541 million, with the operating margin dropping from 47.14% to 24.85%. Despite these declines, net profit improved to $45 million from a marginal $8 million in 2022, lifting the net profit margin from 0.15% to 1.20%, suggesting better bottom-line control or non-operating factors. Income before taxes and income tax expense both decreased substantially, with an effective tax rate slightly improving but remaining very high at 92.69%. Return on equity and return on assets were positive in 2023 at 3.50% and 0.40%, respectively, whereas these metrics were unavailable in 2022. Overall, profitability weakened at the top and operating levels but showed modest improvement in net earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, Harbour Energy increased its cost of goods sold from $2,376 million to $3,613 million, but this was outpaced by revenue growth, improving gross margin. Operating expenses more than doubled from $149 million to $352 million, yet operating income still increased, indicating effective cost control relative to revenue. Asset turnover declined slightly from 33.37% to 30.95%, suggesting a marginal decrease in asset utilization efficiency amid rapid asset growth. Net cash from operations decreased from $2,150 million to $1,615 million, indicating lower cash generation despite higher revenues, which may reflect working capital changes or operational cash flow timing. Inventories increased from $217 million to $368 million, and current liabilities rose significantly, which may impact working capital management. Overall, while cost control allowed for improved margins, asset utilization and cash flow from operations showed some weakening in 2024. | Operational efficiency in 2023 shows mixed signals. Cost of goods sold decreased to $2,376 million from $2,845 million, but the reduction was less than the revenue decline, contributing to margin compression. Operating expenses increased slightly to $149 million from $121 million, indicating some cost pressure. Asset turnover was reported at 33.37%, a new metric for 2023, suggesting relatively high utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations declined to $2,150 million from $3,130 million, reflecting lower cash generation capacity aligned with reduced revenue. Inventories increased from $143 million to $217 million, which may indicate slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supporting liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities remained negative at $(693) million, slightly higher than 2022, indicating continued investment. Overall, the company maintained reasonable operational efficiency but faced challenges in cash flow generation and cost control relative to revenue declines. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show mixed signals in 2024. Leverage remains high with a debt to equity ratio of 385.06%, though improved from 538.51% in 2023, indicating ongoing reliance on debt financing. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined to 69.67%, suggesting tighter short-term financial flexibility. Interest coverage improved from 221.90% to 273.75%, reflecting better ability to cover interest expenses from operating income despite higher interest costs ($602 million vs. $420 million). The effective tax rate increased dramatically to 107.63%, an unusual and potentially concerning figure that may indicate tax-related risks or adjustments impacting net profitability. The net loss and negative returns on equity and assets also highlight earnings volatility. These factors combined suggest moderate financial risk with leverage and tax expense as key areas to monitor. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023 but still warrant attention. The debt to equity ratio decreased significantly to 538.51% from an extremely high 1130.75%, reducing financial leverage risk but still indicating a highly leveraged position. Interest expense increased to $420 million from $358 million, while interest coverage ratio dropped sharply from 709.78% to 221.90%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest costs comfortably, though still at a strong level. The effective tax rate remained very high at 92.69%, slightly lower than 99.68% in 2022, which could impact net profitability and cash flows. Liquidity improved as shown by the current ratio rising to 76.69% from 51.93%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. The decline in total liabilities and improved equity base reduce solvency risk. However, the substantial drop in income before taxes and operating income signals potential earnings volatility. Overall, financial risk has moderated but remains elevated due to leverage and high tax burden. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Harbour Energy's substantial increase in non-current assets and positive net cash from investing of $2,277 million in 2024 indicate significant investment activity, possibly in growth or capacity expansion. Despite a net loss, the company maintained dividend payments at $199 million, slightly higher than 2023, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue diversification improved with new geographic contributions from Norway, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, and North Africa, alongside strong UK sales, which may support future revenue stability and growth. However, the decline in net cash from operations and high tax burden could pressure cash flow sustainability. The improved interest coverage and reduced leverage ratio provide some cushion for financial flexibility. Overall, Harbour Energy appears positioned for growth with ongoing investments and geographic expansion, but must manage cash flow and tax efficiency to sustain future financial performance. | Looking ahead, Harbour Energy plc's investment activity remains consistent with a net cash outflow from investing of $(693) million, slightly higher than 2022, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from financing decreased to $1,667 million from $2,674 million, suggesting reduced reliance on external financing. The company maintained dividend payments at approximately $190 million, signaling a stable dividend policy despite earnings volatility. Revenue by product shows a decline across crude oil and gas sales, with crude oil sales down to $2,086 million from $2,792 million and gas sales down to $1,415 million from $2,322 million, indicating potential challenges in core markets. Geographically, revenue is concentrated in the UK ($3,529 million) and Southeast Asia ($237 million), with no reported revenue from other previously contributing regions, suggesting a geographic concentration risk but also potential focus on core profitable areas. The sustainability of cash flows is under pressure due to declining operational cash generation and negative net cash flow changes. Overall, future performance will depend on managing declining revenues, sustaining investment, and maintaining liquidity and dividend commitments amid a more focused geographic footprint. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Harbour Energy plc faces market risks primarily from commodity price volatility, interest rate fluctuations, and foreign currency exchange rate changes. Commodity prices for oil and gas are influenced by global and regional supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, and political instability, leading to price volatility and unpredictability. The company manages these risks through a Board-approved commodity hedging programme using fixed price contracts and derivative financial instruments such as swaps and options, targeting hedging of 40-70% of next 12 months' production and lower percentages for subsequent years. Interest rate risk arises mainly from floating rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility and fixed rate bonds; the company uses interest rate derivatives including cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage exposure. Foreign currency risk stems from translation of financial instruments and transactions in multiple currencies; the company mitigates this by matching financial assets and liabilities to functional currencies and using forward contracts and swaps. The geopolitical environment, including conflicts and regulatory changes in operating regions, also poses market risks affecting operations and investment. The company actively monitors these external factors and adjusts hedging and financial strategies accordingly. | Harbour Energy plc faces market risks primarily from commodity price volatility, interest rate fluctuations, and foreign currency exchange rate changes. Commodity prices for oil and gas are influenced by global and regional supply-demand dynamics, geopolitical events such as the war in Ukraine and Middle East conflicts, and macroeconomic factors including inflation and interest rates. The company manages these risks through a Board-approved commodity hedging program covering 40-70% of next 12 months' production and lesser percentages for subsequent years, using fixed price contracts and derivative financial instruments (swaps and options). Foreign currency risk arises mainly from USD/GBP exchange rate movements; mitigated by holding financial assets and liabilities in matching functional currencies and using forward contracts to hedge exposures. Interest rate risk is related to floating rate borrowings, though as of 2023, the Group has no floating rate borrowings after settling the RBL and exploration finance facilities. The Group uses interest rate derivatives to manage exposure when applicable. The company also faces market risks from M&A activity and economic uncertainty impacting strategy execution and access to capital. The energy transition and climate change pose transitional market risks including reduced fossil fuel demand and increased cost of capital, managed through emissions reduction plans, investment prioritization, and engagement with stakeholders. Emerging geopolitical and economic uncertainties, including political instability in operating regions, also contribute to market risks. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include failure to deliver expected operational performance due to aging assets requiring significant maintenance, potential unavailability of replacement parts, and limited opportunities to increase production throughput. The company also faces risks from reliance on third-party joint venture partners, infrastructure owners, and suppliers, which may not align with Harbour's values or business objectives, potentially causing delays or loss of market value. Cyber and information security risks have increased with the expanded scale of operations and emerging threats including AI-related risks. Integration risks from acquisitions, such as the Wintershall Dea transaction, include challenges in managing pace, scope, and cost of integration, potential loss of key staff, and maintaining scalable operating models. Emergency preparedness and crisis management are critical to respond to incidents that could impact safety, environment, or operations. The company manages these risks through strong safety leadership, rigorous cost control, proactive risk-based oversight, strategic partnerships, cyber security programs, integration governance frameworks, and comprehensive emergency response systems with regular exercises and training. | Operational risks include failure to maintain reliable and cost-effective production operations, with uncertainties in forecasting production and operating costs. Aging asset base requires substantial expenditures and maintenance; replacement parts may be scarce. There is risk of failing to meet production guidance or contractual obligations, impacting financial performance. The company relies on third parties including suppliers, JV partners, and infrastructure owners, with risks of supply chain disruptions, partner misalignment, and access to transport. Supply chain risks are elevated due to competing demand from renewables, geopolitical risks, inflation, and contractor capacity constraints, especially in the UK. Integration risks exist related to acquisitions, notably the Wintershall Dea asset portfolio, including transition delays, cost overruns, and loss of key staff. Cyber and information security risks have increased due to evolving threats and non-malicious data sharing risks. Physical risks from acute weather events (storms, flooding) and chronic hazards (extreme heat) are managed through asset design, emergency response plans, and climate risk assessments. Emergency preparedness and crisis management systems are in place with regular exercises and competency development. The company also faces risks related to drilling operations, capital projects, and decommissioning, including delays, cost overruns, and quality issues. Operational performance is monitored via metrics integrated into business performance and incentive compensation, with proactive risk-based oversight and benchmarking. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks encompass market risks (commodity price, interest rate, foreign exchange), liquidity risk, credit risk, and risks related to financial discipline. The company manages commodity price risk via a hedging programme using fixed price contracts and derivatives, with detailed sensitivity analyses reported. Interest rate risk is managed through a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings and interest rate derivatives, including cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by currency matching and forward contracts. Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring borrowings maturity profiles and ensuring financing commitments are met through operating cash flows and committed credit lines. Credit risk arises from counterparties and financial instruments; the company applies Group-wide credit approval procedures, monitors exposures, and uses expected credit loss models per IFRS 9. Financial discipline is maintained through a defined financial framework ensuring robust controls, efficient capital allocation, and adherence to risk appetite to support investment, dividend policy, and credit ratings. Derivative activities are conducted by specialist teams with no speculative trading. The company also discloses contingent consideration related to acquisitions and impairment assessments based on key assumptions. | Financial risks encompass market risks (commodity price, interest rate, foreign currency), credit risk, liquidity risk, and risks related to financial instruments. Commodity price risk is managed through hedging programs using fixed price contracts and derivatives, with sensitivity analyses showing impacts on equity but limited effect on profit before tax. Interest rate risk is primarily from floating rate debt, but as of 2023, the Group holds only fixed rate borrowings (a 5.5% bond) with no floating rate borrowings, reducing exposure. Foreign currency risk arises mainly from USD/GBP fluctuations; mitigated by currency matching and forward contracts. Credit risk is limited by trading only with creditworthy counterparties, credit verification procedures, and monitoring receivables; concentration risk exists with one customer accounting for over 88% of revenue. Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring debt maturities and maintaining committed credit lines; available liquidity was $1.6 billion at year-end 2023. The Group uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and does not engage in speculative trading. Financial risk management policies are overseen by senior management and specialist teams, with internal controls and Board monitoring. Uncertain tax positions related to hedging instruments pose contingent liabilities up to $120 million. The company maintains a strong capital structure with reduced leverage ratio (0.1x in 2023). |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Harbour Energy faces significant economic challenges including continued geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, and commodity price volatility. Inflationary pressures and cost increases, such as operating expenditure rising to $3,613 million driven by acquired assets and inventory movements, impact unit operating costs which were slightly above target at $19.7 per boe. The company is exposed to commodity price fluctuations, with Brent crude averaging $81/bbl in 2024 but fluctuating widely due to geopolitical conflicts, supply-demand dynamics, and economic factors including softer Chinese growth and recession risks. Regional natural gas markets, such as Argentina and Egypt, present pricing risks due to fixed and formula-linked contracts. The UK’s increased and extended Energy Profits Levy and removal of investment allowance uplift create a more punitive fiscal regime, negatively affecting investment climate. Political instability, regulatory changes, and fiscal uncertainties in operating countries, including potential adverse tax policies, price controls, currency fluctuations, and trade barriers, add to economic risks. Inflation assumptions of 2.5% per annum for operating and capital expenditures and uncertainties in decommissioning costs further contribute to cost pressures. The company also faces risks from foreign exchange fluctuations and interest rate changes. Despite these challenges, Harbour manages risks through a defined financial framework, active commodity hedging, and diversified portfolio exposure. However, downside scenarios with 20% commodity price reductions and 10% production declines indicate liquidity headroom could run out by late 2027 without mitigating actions. | Harbour Energy faces several economic challenges and uncertainties that could impact its revenue and profitability. Persistent inflationary pressures and rising interest rates across developed markets have increased operating costs and financing expenses. The UK oil and gas fiscal regime remains uncertain, particularly due to the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) and the Energy Security Investment Mechanism (ESIM), which have not restored full industry confidence. Macroeconomic uncertainty persists globally, with geopolitical tensions such as the war in Ukraine and Middle East conflicts contributing to commodity price volatility. The company also faces risks from fluctuating commodity prices, with Brent crude and UK NBP gas prices subject to unpredictable supply and demand dynamics, impacting cash flow and access to capital. Additionally, the company must manage cost pressures related to aging assets, decommissioning liabilities, and supply chain constraints exacerbated by inflation and geopolitical risks. Access to capital is challenged by a general decline in lender appetite for the oil and gas sector, although Harbour has mitigated this through extending its reserve based lending facility and expects investment grade credit ratings following a major acquisition. The company also faces foreign currency risks primarily from US dollar and pound sterling exchange rate fluctuations. Overall, economic uncertainties including inflation, fiscal and regulatory changes, commodity price volatility, and capital market conditions present ongoing challenges to Harbour Energy's financial performance and strategic execution. |
