# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Capricorn Energy PLC's revenue has shown a declining trend from 229.6 million USD in 2022 to 201.0 million USD in 2023, and further down to 147.8 million USD in 2024. Despite this decline in revenue, the gross margin has remained relatively stable and high, slightly decreasing from 131.01% in 2022 to 129.65% in 2023 and 128.15% in 2024, indicating strong profitability on direct costs. Revenue by product shows a consistent decrease in oil sales from 181.4 million USD in 2022 to 111.6 million USD in 2024, and gas sales also declined from 47.5 million USD in 2022 to 35.2 million USD in 2024. Royalty income remained minimal but slightly increased to 1.0 million USD in 2024. Geographically, the vast majority of revenue is generated from Egypt, decreasing from 228.9 million USD in 2022 to 146.8 million USD in 2024, with other Capricorn Energy Group contributions remaining marginal around 1.0 million USD. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved significantly from a negative 59.06% in 2022 and negative 43.48% in 2023 to a positive 20.37% in 2024, reflecting a turnaround in operating performance. Operating income moved from a loss of 135.6 million USD in 2022 and 87.4 million USD in 2023 to a positive 30.1 million USD in 2024, despite the declining revenue. Operating expenses decreased from 65.0 million USD in 2022 to 23.9 million USD in 2024, indicating effective cost management and expense control. The improvement in operating income relative to revenue suggests enhanced operational efficiency and better cost discipline over the period. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate experienced a dramatic change, moving from 18.79% in 2022 to 39.67% in 2023, and then to a negative rate of (190.65%) in 2024, which significantly impacted net profitability. This negative effective tax rate in 2024 contributed to a positive net profit of 10.6 million USD, reversing large net losses of 67.1 million USD in 2022 and 144.0 million USD in 2023. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Capricorn Energy PLC's total assets decreased to $619.7 million from $667.6 million in 2023, reflecting a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a reduction in both current assets (from $383.8 million to $366.8 million) and non-current assets (from $280.6 million to $252.9 million). Total liabilities slightly increased to $270.4 million from $261.1 million, with a notable rise in current liabilities (from $123.4 million to $163.5 million) offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities (from $137.7 million to $106.9 million). Shareholders' equity declined significantly to $349.3 million from $406.5 million, indicating a weakening equity base. The current ratio decreased from 311.02% to 224.34%, signaling reduced but still strong short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased from 64.23% to 77.41%, indicating a higher leverage position and a shift towards greater reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Overall, the company shows a contraction in asset size and equity, with increased leverage and somewhat diminished liquidity, suggesting a more cautious financial health profile in 2024 compared to 2023. | In 2023, Capricorn Energy PLC experienced a significant contraction in total assets, declining from $1,463.0 million in 2022 to $667.6 million, reflecting a substantial asset base reduction. Current assets similarly decreased sharply from $1,041.8 million to $383.8 million, while non-current assets fell from $421.2 million to $280.6 million. Total liabilities also declined from $341.4 million to $261.1 million, with current liabilities slightly decreasing from $137.2 million to $123.4 million and non-current liabilities from $204.2 million to $137.7 million. Shareholders' equity contracted markedly from $1,121.6 million to $406.5 million, indicating a weakened equity base. The current ratio dropped from an exceptionally high 759.33% in 2022 to 311.02% in 2023, still indicating strong liquidity but at a reduced level. The debt to equity ratio more than doubled from 30.44% to 64.23%, signaling increased leverage and a shift toward greater reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 shows a smaller asset base and equity cushion, with improved but still strong liquidity, and a notably higher leverage position compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined by 26.5% from $201.0 million in 2023 to $147.8 million in 2024, driven by decreases in both oil sales ($159.1 million to $111.6 million) and gas sales ($40.8 million to $35.2 million). Despite lower revenue, gross profit decreased less sharply from $75.1 million to $51.2 million, maintaining a high gross margin of 128.15%, slightly down from 129.65% in 2023, indicating strong cost control at the production level. Operating expenses dropped significantly from $61.9 million to $23.9 million, resulting in a turnaround from an operating loss of $87.4 million in 2023 to an operating income of $30.1 million in 2024. Net profit improved dramatically from a loss of $144.0 million to a positive $10.6 million, with net profit margin improving from -71.64% to 7.17%. Return on equity turned positive at 2.80% from a negative 18.85%, and return on assets improved to 1.65% from -13.52%, reflecting improved earnings quality and profitability despite lower top-line revenue. The effective tax rate swung to a negative figure (-190.65%) due to tax expense of $26.5 million on positive income before taxes of $13.9 million, suggesting possible tax adjustments or deferred tax impacts affecting earnings quality. | Revenue decreased by 12.5% from $229.6 million in 2022 to $201.0 million in 2023, driven by declines in both oil sales (from $181.4 million to $159.1 million) and gas sales (from $47.5 million to $40.8 million), partially offset by a slight increase in royalty income. Gross profit declined from $81.9 million to $75.1 million, with gross margin slightly decreasing from 131.01% to 129.65%, indicating relatively stable cost of goods sold efficiency. Operating income improved from a large loss of $135.6 million to a smaller loss of $87.4 million, and operating margin improved from -59.06% to -43.48%, reflecting better control over operating expenses which decreased from $65.0 million to $61.9 million. However, net profit deteriorated sharply from a loss of $67.1 million to a much larger loss of $144.0 million, with net profit margin worsening from -29.22% to -71.64%. This deterioration is influenced by increased interest expense (from $18.2 million to $25.3 million) and a higher effective tax rate rising from 18.79% to 39.67%, despite income before taxes improving from -$148.5 million to -$102.1 million. Return on equity and return on assets were negative at -18.85% and -13.52% respectively, indicating poor earnings quality and negative returns on invested capital in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by an increase in asset turnover from 18.87% to 22.96%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue despite the overall asset base contraction. Cost of goods sold decreased proportionally with revenue, maintaining a stable gross margin. Operating expenses were significantly reduced by more than 60%, from $61.9 million to $23.9 million, demonstrating effective cost control measures. Net cash from operations turned positive at $86.1 million compared to a negative $39.9 million in 2023, indicating a strong improvement in cash generation from core business activities. Inventories remained stable at around $8 million, suggesting consistent working capital management. However, the current ratio decreased, reflecting tighter liquidity but still adequate coverage of current liabilities. Overall, Capricorn Energy PLC enhanced operational efficiency through cost reduction, improved asset utilization, and strong operational cash flow generation in 2024. | Operational efficiency in 2023 weakened as reflected by a negative net cash from operations of -$39.9 million compared to a positive $14.8 million in 2022, indicating cash flow challenges from core business activities. Asset turnover was high at 18.87, suggesting strong revenue generation relative to asset base despite the asset contraction. Cost control showed some improvement with operating expenses decreasing from $65.0 million to $61.9 million, and cost of goods sold also declining from $71.2 million to $59.6 million, consistent with lower revenue. Inventories remained stable at approximately $8.3 million. Working capital, while still positive, decreased as current assets and current liabilities both declined, with the current ratio falling from 759.33% to 311.02%. Overall, the company faced operational cash flow difficulties in 2023 despite maintaining cost discipline and high asset turnover. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators present mixed signals in 2024. The debt to equity ratio increased to 77.41% from 64.23%, indicating higher leverage and potential increased financial risk. The current ratio declined from 311.02% to 224.34%, showing reduced liquidity buffer though still above 2.0x, which is generally considered healthy. Interest expense decreased from $25.3 million to $20.4 million, but interest coverage ratio turned negative at -147.55% from a very high positive 345.45% in 2023, signaling that operating income is insufficient to cover interest expenses, which is a significant early warning sign of financial distress. The effective tax rate shifted dramatically to a negative figure (-190.65%), which may reflect tax credits or adjustments but also introduces uncertainty in tax obligations. The increase in current liabilities and decrease in non-current liabilities suggest possible short-term refinancing risks. These factors combined indicate elevated financial risk and warrant close monitoring of liquidity and debt servicing capacity. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 highlight increased leverage and liquidity risk. The debt to equity ratio more than doubled to 64.23% from 30.44% in 2022, indicating a higher reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased by 39% to $25.3 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased from an extremely high 745.05% to 345.45%, still indicating the company can cover interest expenses comfortably but with reduced margin of safety. The effective tax rate nearly doubled to 39.67%, increasing the tax burden despite negative pre-tax income. Liquidity, while still strong with a current ratio of 311.02%, declined significantly from the prior year. The large net loss and negative operating cash flow raise concerns about earnings sustainability and cash generation. The substantial dividend payment of $542.1 million in 2023, despite negative cash flow, may also pose financial strain. These factors collectively suggest elevated financial risk and early warning signs related to leverage, cash flow adequacy, and tax expense pressures. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company’s net cash from investing activities turned negative at -$51.3 million in 2024 from a positive $120.8 million in 2023, indicating increased investment outflows, possibly for growth or asset maintenance. Net cash from financing activities improved to a negative $97.3 million from a much larger outflow of $646.2 million, reflecting reduced financing activity or debt repayments. Dividends paid decreased substantially to $50.1 million from $542.1 million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy aligned with improved but still cautious profitability and cash flow sustainability. Revenue remains heavily concentrated in Egypt ($146.8 million of $147.8 million total), indicating geographic concentration risk but also focus. The improved operational cash flow and positive net profit in 2024, combined with ongoing investment outflows, suggest Capricorn Energy PLC is positioning for sustainable future growth, though the increased leverage and liquidity tightening require prudent financial management to support this trajectory. | Looking forward, Capricorn Energy PLC’s future financial performance may face challenges given the 2023 financial trends. The company’s net cash from investing activities sharply decreased from a large inflow of $1,012.6 million in 2022 to a modest inflow of $120.8 million in 2023, indicating reduced investment activity or asset sales. Net cash from financing activities remained negative and increased in outflow from -$579.6 million to -$646.2 million, driven in part by a substantial dividend payment of $542.1 million, which may pressure liquidity and cash flow sustainability. Revenue remains concentrated geographically in Egypt ($199.9 million of $201.0 million total revenue), suggesting geographic concentration risk but also potential focus on core markets. The company’s high asset turnover suggests efficient use of assets, but negative operating cash flow and large net losses raise concerns about ongoing profitability and cash generation. The increased leverage and dividend payout policy may constrain financial flexibility. Overall, unless operational cash flow improves and investment activity stabilizes, sustaining dividends and funding growth may be challenging, potentially impacting future financial performance negatively. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Capricorn Energy PLC faces market risks primarily from volatile oil and gas prices which impact revenue, debt availability, and cash flow, especially from its Egyptian production. The transition to net zero presents challenges including reduced demand for oil, increasing costs, climate-related policy changes, reputational damage, and difficulties in retaining and attracting talent. Political and fiscal uncertainties in countries of operation, particularly Egypt, pose risks of loss of value and uncertain financial outcomes. The inability to secure new growth opportunities outside Egypt and failure to replace long-term reserves and resources also threaten the Group's strategic objectives. The Group manages these risks through a medium risk appetite, active monitoring of market conditions, maintaining a low-cost portfolio, embedding carbon pricing in investment screening, and maintaining strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation. Sensitivity analyses and downside scenarios are used to assess impacts of price fluctuations and production changes. | Capricorn Energy PLC faces market risks including volatile oil and gas prices which impact revenue, cash flow, and contingent payment values. The geopolitical environment, such as Middle East tensions and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, affects supply and demand dynamics. Demand volatility is influenced by industrial activity shifts due to high gas prices, and there is a risk of declining oil and gas demand due to energy transition and changing consumer behavior. Political and fiscal uncertainties in countries of operation, especially Egypt and Senegal, pose risks to operations and financial viability. The company manages these risks through sensitivity analyses, cost reduction initiatives, maintaining sufficient financial headroom, and active engagement with partners and governments to resolve receivables and regulatory issues. Capricorn also monitors energy demand indices and incorporates carbon pricing and climate-related scenarios into investment decisions to ensure portfolio resilience. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include underperformance of producing assets, delays or reductions in cash flow, reserves downgrades or impairments, cost and schedule overruns, HSSE incidents, and reputational damage. Specific operational challenges arise from managing producing assets in Egypt, including optimizing production, reservoir management, and drilling activities. The Group faces risks related to adherence to HSSE policies, with potential for serious injury, environmental impacts, regulatory penalties, and reputational harm. Operational risks are mitigated by engaging actively with partners, conducting independent economic analyses, prioritizing economic projects, maintaining HSSE training and audits, business resilience and emergency response procedures, and third-party security assessments. The Group also implements water conservation and heat stress mitigation measures in response to physical climate risks. | Operational risks include underperformance of producing assets in the UK and Egypt, health, safety, security, and environmental (HSSE) risks such as serious injury, environmental impacts, and regulatory penalties.

# Section 6: Future Outlook

## S6.1: Strategic Direction

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mergers and Acquisition | Capricorn's M&A strategy focuses on developing scale and longevity outside Egypt to increase cash flows and deliver consistent shareholder returns. The company aims to diversify and expand operations by leveraging core corporate capabilities to identify, acquire, and exploit the right assets in the right locations. Currently, Capricorn is evaluating M&A opportunities in the UK North Sea and the MENA region against strict strategic, financial, and returns criteria. The company also explores strategic investments and partnerships to enhance shareholder value. No specific deal values were disclosed for new acquisitions, but the company completed a $50m disposal of the Sangomar asset to Woodside Energy and is managing a $22.5m receivable from Waldorf Production UK related to a prior UK asset sale. The company concluded its share buyback program in 2024, purchasing approximately $7m of shares during the year, with no plans to resume buybacks currently. | The Company is focused on expanding its non-operated production base in the UK North Sea, exemplified by the expected completion in Q2 2024 of the acquisition of a 25% working interest in the Columbus gas condensate field. This acquisition is subject to completion, with a fallback payment of $7m if not completed by the longstop date. The Company has exited all non-Egypt licenses during 2023, including positions in Mexico and Suriname, and amended contingent payment arrangements with Waldorf resulting in accelerated cash receipts and acquisition of a 25% non-operated interest in the Columbus field. The strategic rationale is to focus capital and internal resources on the Egyptian portfolio while growing value in the UK North Sea. The Company is also seeking to defer contingent obligations related to its Egyptian asset acquisitions. Additionally, the Board has committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders, including a share buyback programme of at least $25m over 12 months and a planned special dividend payment of $50m in Q2 2024. |
