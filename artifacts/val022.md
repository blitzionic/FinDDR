# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue has shown a declining trend from 2022 to 2024, decreasing from $229.6 million in 2022 to $201.0 million in 2023, and further down to $147.8 million in 2024, indicating a significant drop of approximately 35.5% over the two years. Gross Margin has remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease from 129.65% in 2023 to 128.15% in 2024. The revenue breakdown by product shows that oil sales have decreased from $228.9 million in 2022 to $146.8 million in 2024, while other income has remained relatively flat. Geographically, revenue from Egypt has mirrored the product trends, declining from $228.9 million in 2022 to $146.8 million in 2024, suggesting a concentrated risk in this market. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating Margin has decreased significantly from 59.06% in 2022 to 20.37% in 2024, reflecting a deterioration in operational efficiency. Operating income has improved from -$135.6 million in 2022 to $30.1 million in 2024, indicating a recovery in operational performance despite the declining revenue. Operating expenses have also decreased from $65.0 million in 2022 to $23.9 million in 2024, showcasing effective cost management strategies that have helped to mitigate losses and improve profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The Effective Tax Rate has increased dramatically from 18.79% in 2022 to 190.65% in 2024, which is an unusual pattern that could significantly impact net profitability. This spike in the tax rate may indicate non-recurring tax liabilities or adjustments that need to be addressed. Additionally, the company has faced external pressures that have likely contributed to the declining revenue, particularly in the oil market, which is susceptible to fluctuations in global demand and pricing. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company's total assets decreased to $619.7 million from $667.6 million in 2023, indicating a significant decline in asset base. Current assets also fell to $366.8 million, while current liabilities increased to $163.5 million, resulting in a current ratio of 224.34%, which, despite being high, reflects a decrease in liquidity compared to 311.02% in 2023. The total liabilities increased slightly to $270.4 million, while shareholders' equity decreased to $349.3 million, indicating a weakening equity position and potential concerns regarding financial stability. | In 2023, the company maintained a relatively strong financial position with total assets of $667.6 million and total liabilities of $261.1 million, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 64.23%. The current ratio was robust at 311.02%, suggesting good short-term liquidity.

| Profitability and earnings quality | In 2024, the company reported revenue of $147.8 million, a significant decline from $201.0 million in 2023. However, gross profit improved to $51.2 million, indicating better cost management with a gross margin of 128.15%. Operating income turned positive at $30.1 million, a substantial recovery from the operating loss of $87.4 million in 2023. The net profit of $10.6 million reflects a positive turnaround, although the net profit margin dropped to 7.17% from 71.64% in 2023, indicating challenges in maintaining profitability levels. | In 2023, the company faced significant challenges, reporting a net loss of $144.0 million on revenues of $201.0 million. The gross profit was $75.1 million, with a gross margin of 129.65%. The operating loss of $87.4 million highlighted severe operational inefficiencies, and the net profit margin of 71.64% was misleading due to the substantial losses incurred. Return on equity was 18.85%, but this was overshadowed by the overall negative performance. |
| Operational efficiency | In 2024, the operating margin improved to 20.37%, reflecting better cost management as operating expenses decreased to $23.9 million from $61.9 million in 2023. The asset turnover ratio increased to 22.96%, indicating improved efficiency in utilizing assets to generate revenue. The net cash from operations of $86.1 million marks a significant recovery from the negative cash flow of $(39.9) million in 2023, suggesting enhanced operational efficiency and cash generation capabilities. | In 2023, the company struggled with operational efficiency, as evidenced by an operating margin of 43.48% despite incurring an operating loss of $87.4 million. The asset turnover ratio was lower at 18.87%, indicating less effective use of assets. The negative net cash from operations of $(39.9) million highlighted significant challenges in cash flow management, which could impact future operational capabilities. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | In 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio increased to 77.41%, indicating higher financial leverage and potential risk in managing debt levels. The current ratio of 224.34% suggests adequate liquidity, but the increase in current liabilities to $163.5 million raises concerns about short-term obligations. The effective tax rate surged to 190.65%, which could indicate potential tax liabilities affecting profitability and cash flow. | In 2023, the company had a debt-to-equity ratio of 64.23%, which was manageable but indicated reliance on debt financing. The current ratio of 311.02% suggested strong liquidity, but the overall financial performance raised concerns about sustainability. The effective tax rate of 39.67% was relatively stable, but the significant losses could lead to future tax implications. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company appears to be on a recovery path with improved cash flow from operations and a positive net profit in 2024. However, the decline in revenue and assets suggests that strategic investments and market expansion will be crucial for sustainable growth. The focus on cost management and operational efficiency will be key to maintaining profitability and supporting future investments. | In 2023, the company faced significant challenges that hindered future performance projections. The negative cash flow from operations and substantial losses indicated a need for restructuring and strategic realignment. Future growth would depend on improving operational efficiency, managing costs, and potentially exploring new markets to recover lost revenues. |
