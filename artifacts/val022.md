# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue has shown a declining trend from 2022 to 2024, decreasing from $229.6 million in 2022 to $147.8 million in 2024, representing a significant drop of approximately 35.5%. Gross Margin has also decreased slightly from 131.01% in 2022 to 128.15% in 2024, indicating a minor decline in profitability relative to revenue. The revenue breakdown shows that oil and gas sales have decreased from $228.9 million in 2022 to $146.8 million in 2024, while other income has remained relatively stable. Geographic revenue distribution mirrors this trend, with revenue from Egypt dropping from $228.9 million in 2022 to $146.8 million in 2024, while other regions contributed minimally. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating Margin has significantly decreased from 59.06% in 2022 to 20.37% in 2024, indicating a deterioration in operational efficiency. Operating income has improved from a loss of $135.6 million in 2022 to a profit of $30.1 million in 2024, suggesting better cost management despite declining revenues. Operating expenses have decreased from $61.9 million in 2023 to $23.9 million in 2024, reflecting effective cost management strategies that have helped to improve profitability despite lower revenue. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The Effective Tax Rate has increased dramatically from 18.79% in 2022 to 190.65% in 2024, which is an unusual pattern that could significantly impact net profitability. This spike in the tax rate may indicate non-recurring tax liabilities or adjustments. Additionally, the net profit margin has fluctuated, with a significant drop to 7.17% in 2024 from 29.22% in 2022, reflecting the impact of both the increased tax rate and the overall decline in revenue. External factors such as market conditions in the oil and gas sector may also be influencing these profitability metrics. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company's total assets decreased to $619.7 million from $667.6 million in 2023, indicating a significant reduction in asset base. Current assets also fell to $366.8 million, while current liabilities increased to $163.5 million, resulting in a current ratio of 224.34%, which, despite being high, reflects a decline in liquidity compared to 311.02% in 2023. The total liabilities increased slightly to $270.4 million, while shareholders' equity decreased to $349.3 million, indicating a weakening equity position and potential concerns regarding financial stability. | In 2023, the company maintained a relatively strong financial position with total assets of $667.6 million and total liabilities of $261.1 million, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 64.23%. The current ratio was robust at 311.02%, suggesting good short-term liquidity. However, the significant decline in shareholders' equity to $406.5 million from $1121.6 million in 2022 raises concerns about the sustainability of the company's financial health moving forward. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | In 2024, the company reported revenue of $147.8 million, a significant drop from $201.0 million in 2023. Despite this, gross profit improved to $51.2 million, indicating better cost management with a gross margin of 128.15%. Operating income turned positive at $30.1 million, a notable recovery from the operating loss of $87.4 million in 2023. The net profit of $10.6 million reflects a return to profitability, although the net profit margin of 7.17% is considerably lower than the previous year's 71.64%. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) were 2.80% and 1.65%, respectively, indicating a recovery but still below optimal levels. | In 2023, the company faced significant challenges, reporting a net loss of $144.0 million on revenues of $201.0 million. The gross profit was $75.1 million, with a gross margin of 129.65%. However, the operating margin plummeted to 43.48%, reflecting high operating expenses. The effective tax rate was 39.67%, which, combined with the losses, severely impacted profitability. The return on equity was 18.85%, indicating a strong performance relative to the equity base, but the overall earnings quality was compromised by the substantial losses. |
| Operational efficiency | In 2024, the operating margin improved to 20.37%, reflecting better cost control and operational efficiency. The asset turnover ratio increased to 22.96%, indicating more effective use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations was positive at $86.1 million, a significant turnaround from the negative cash flow of $(39.9) million in 2023, suggesting improved operational cash generation. However, working capital management remains a concern with current liabilities rising relative to current assets. | In 2023, the company struggled with operational efficiency, as evidenced by an operating margin of 43.48% and negative net cash from operations of $(39.9) million. The asset turnover ratio was lower at 18.87%, indicating less effective asset utilization. High operating expenses contributed to the overall losses, and the company faced challenges in managing its working capital effectively, which impacted liquidity and operational performance. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | In 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio increased to 77.41%, indicating higher financial leverage and potential risk in managing debt levels. The interest coverage ratio decreased to 147.55%, suggesting reduced ability to cover interest expenses, although it remains above 1. The effective tax rate surged to 190.65%, raising concerns about tax liabilities impacting net income. Overall, while liquidity ratios remain strong, the increase in leverage and tax burden presents financial risks that need to be monitored closely. | In 2023, the company had a debt-to-equity ratio of 64.23%, which was manageable but indicated reliance on debt financing. The interest coverage ratio was high at 345.45%, suggesting strong capacity to meet interest obligations. However, the effective tax rate of 39.67% was a concern, especially given the net losses. The liquidity ratios were strong, but the overall financial risk was heightened due to the significant losses and declining equity. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company appears to be on a recovery path with positive net cash from operations and a return to profitability in 2024. However, the decline in revenue and assets suggests that growth may be limited unless strategic investments are made. The focus on cost management and operational efficiency will be crucial for sustaining cash flow and profitability. Future projections will depend on market conditions and the company's ability to expand its operations effectively. | In 2023, the outlook was bleak due to significant losses and declining revenues. The company needed to focus on restructuring and improving operational efficiency to stabilize cash flows. The high levels of debt and declining equity posed risks to future performance, and without strategic investments or market recovery, the company faced challenges in achieving sustainable growth. |
