# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue declined significantly from $229.6M in 2022 to $201.0M in 2023 (-12.44%) and further to $147.8M in 2024 (-26.46%). Gross profit also decreased from $81.9M in 2022 to $75.1M in 2023 and then to $51.2M in 2024. Despite the revenue decline, gross margin remained exceptionally high and stable, at 129.65% in 2023 and 128.15% in 2024, indicating strong direct cost control or possibly accounting factors inflating gross profit relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service is heavily concentrated in Egypt, contributing nearly all revenue each year (e.g., $146.8M of $147.8M in 2024), with minimal contribution from Other Capricorn Energy Group ($1.0M in 2024). The geographic revenue distribution is similarly concentrated in Egypt with no reported revenue from Mexico or other countries, showing no geographic diversification and increasing exposure to Egypt's market conditions. Overall, the company faces declining top-line revenue but maintains a very high gross margin, suggesting direct costs are well managed or that revenue recognition and cost accounting may be unusual. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a dramatic improvement from a negative (43.48%) in 2023 to a positive 20.37% in 2024, reflecting a turnaround in operational profitability. Operating income swung from a large loss of -$87.4M in 2023 to a positive $30.1M in 2024, despite revenue declining by 26.46% in the same period. Operating expenses decreased substantially from -$61.9M in 2023 to -$23.9M in 2024, indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency improvements. The relationship between operating income and revenue improved markedly, with operating income representing 20.37% of revenue in 2024 compared to a large loss in 2023. This suggests the company successfully reduced operating costs and improved operational leverage despite shrinking revenue, signaling a positive shift in cost structure and operational discipline. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate changed drastically from 39.67% in 2023 to a negative (190.65%) in 2024, indicating a significant tax benefit or reversal of tax expenses in 2024. This unusual negative tax rate contributed to the net profit of $10.6M in 2024 despite a relatively modest operating income of $30.1M. In contrast, 2023 showed a net loss of -$144.0M with a positive tax expense of -$40.5M, suggesting tax charges exacerbated losses. The large negative tax rate in 2024 may reflect non-recurring tax credits, deferred tax asset realizations, or other one-off tax-related items positively impacting profitability. No other explicit non-recurring items or external factors are detailed, but the tax rate anomaly is a key external factor influencing net profitability in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company’s total assets decreased to $619.7 million from $667.6 million in 2023, indicating a contraction in asset base. Current assets slightly declined to $366.8 million, while non-current assets also reduced to $252.9 million. Total liabilities increased marginally to $270.4 million from $261.1 million, driven by a rise in current liabilities to $163.5 million from $123.4 million, despite a decrease in non-current liabilities to $106.9 million. Shareholders' equity declined to $349.3 million from $406.5 million, reflecting reduced retained earnings ($388.9 million vs. $444.2 million). The current ratio decreased from 311.02% to 224.34%, indicating lower but still strong liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased to 77.41% from 64.23%, suggesting a higher leverage position. Overall, the balance sheet shows a modest weakening in equity and liquidity positions, with increased reliance on short-term liabilities, but the company maintains a solid capital structure with equity exceeding liabilities by a significant margin. | In 2023, the company experienced a significant contraction in total assets, declining from $1,463.0 million in 2022 to $667.6 million, indicating a substantial reduction in asset base. Both current assets and non-current assets decreased markedly, with current assets falling from $1,041.8 million to $383.8 million and non-current assets from $421.2 million to $280.6 million. Total liabilities also decreased from $341.4 million to $261.1 million, reflecting some liability management, but the reduction in liabilities was proportionally less than the decline in equity. Shareholders' equity dropped sharply from $1,121.6 million to $406.5 million, signaling a weakened equity position and balance sheet strength. The current ratio declined from 759.33% to 311.02%, indicating a reduction in liquidity though it remains above 1, suggesting the company can cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio increased from 30.44% to 64.23%, showing a higher leverage level relative to equity, which may raise concerns about capital structure stability. Overall, the financial position in 2023 reflects a weakened balance sheet with diminished asset base and equity, moderate liability reduction, and reduced liquidity compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined significantly by approximately 26.5% to $147.8 million in 2024 from $201.0 million in 2023, primarily driven by reduced sales in Egypt ($146.8 million vs. $199.9 million). Despite lower revenue, gross profit decreased proportionally to $51.2 million from $75.1 million, maintaining a stable gross margin around 128.15%, slightly down from 129.65%. Operating expenses were substantially reduced to $23.9 million from $61.9 million, resulting in a positive operating income of $30.1 million compared to a large operating loss of $87.4 million in 2023. Net profit turned positive at $10.6 million from a net loss of $144.0 million, improving net profit margin to 7.17% from a negative 71.64%. Return on equity improved to 2.80% from a negative 18.85%, and return on assets rose to 1.65% from negative 13.52%, indicating improved earnings quality and sustainability despite lower top-line. The effective tax rate was negative at -190.65%, reflecting tax benefits or adjustments impacting net income positively. | The company’s revenue decreased from $229.6 million in 2022 to $201.0 million in 2023, a decline of approximately 12.5%, primarily driven by lower revenue from Egypt ($228.9 million to $199.9 million). Gross profit decreased from $81.9 million to $75.1 million, with a reported gross margin of 129.65% in 2023, which appears unusually high and may reflect accounting or classification anomalies given the cost of goods sold is negative at -$59.6 million. Operating expenses were $61.9 million, resulting in an operating loss of $87.4 million and an operating margin of -43.48%, indicating significant operational inefficiencies or extraordinary charges. Net profit was a loss of $144.0 million, with a net profit margin of -71.64%, reflecting poor earnings quality and sustainability. Return on equity and return on assets were negative at -18.85% and -13.52%, respectively, confirming unprofitable operations and erosion of shareholder value. The effective tax rate was 39.67%, consistent with the income before taxes loss of -$102.1 million and income tax expense of -$40.5 million, which may include deferred tax impacts. Overall, profitability in 2023 was severely impaired with large losses and negative returns, indicating poor earnings quality and sustainability. |
| Operational efficiency | The company demonstrated improved operational efficiency in 2024. Operating margin turned positive to 20.37% from a negative 43.48% in 2023, reflecting better cost control and expense management. Asset turnover increased to 22.96% from 18.87%, indicating more effective utilization of assets to generate revenue despite the overall asset base contraction. Net cash from operations improved dramatically to a positive $86.1 million from a negative $39.9 million, signaling strong cash generation capability. Inventories remained stable at $8.0 million, supporting efficient working capital management. The current ratio, while lower, remains healthy at 224.34%, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, the company enhanced its cost control, asset utilization, and cash flow generation in 2024. | Operational efficiency in 2023 was weak, as evidenced by the operating margin of -43.48%, reflecting high operating expenses relative to gross profit. The asset turnover ratio was 18.87, which is unusually high and may indicate either a low asset base or revenue recognition issues; however, given the large asset base reduction, this may reflect asset shrinkage rather than improved utilization. Net cash from operations was negative at -$39.9 million, a deterioration from positive $14.8 million in 2022, indicating cash flow challenges from core business activities. Inventories remained stable at approximately $8.3 million, suggesting no significant inventory build-up. Working capital, while positive given current assets of $383.8 million and current liabilities of $123.4 million, declined in absolute terms compared to 2022. Overall, the company faced operational inefficiencies with negative operating income, poor cash flow generation, and questionable asset utilization in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show mixed signals in 2024. The debt to equity ratio increased to 77.41% from 64.23%, indicating higher leverage and potential increased financial risk. Current liabilities rose significantly, which may pressure short-term liquidity despite a still strong current ratio of 224.34%. Interest expense decreased to $20.4 million from $25.3 million, but interest coverage ratio turned negative at -147.55% from a very high positive 345.45%, suggesting earnings before interest and taxes were insufficient to cover interest costs, posing a risk to debt servicing capacity. The effective tax rate was negative at -190.65%, which may indicate tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces complexity and potential volatility in tax obligations. Overall, while liquidity remains adequate, increased leverage and poor interest coverage highlight areas of financial risk requiring monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show increased leverage and liquidity concerns. The debt to equity ratio rose to 64.23% from 30.44% in 2022, indicating higher reliance on debt financing relative to equity. The current ratio decreased to 311.02% from 759.33%, signaling reduced but still adequate short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased from $18.2 million to $25.3 million, reflecting higher debt costs or increased borrowings. Despite this, the interest coverage ratio is reported at 345.45%, which is unusually high given the operating loss, suggesting possible data inconsistency or non-operating income supporting interest payments. The effective tax rate of 39.67% is relatively high, which could pressure net income if profitability improves. The negative net cash from operations and large dividend payments of $542.1 million in 2023 raise concerns about cash flow sustainability and potential liquidity strain. Overall, the company faces elevated financial risk due to increased leverage, reduced liquidity, and negative operating cash flows. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities reversed from a positive net cash inflow of $120.8 million in 2023 to a net outflow of $51.3 million in 2024, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities improved to an outflow of $97.3 million from a much larger $646.2 million, reflecting reduced financing cash demands. Dividends paid decreased substantially to $50.1 million from $542.1 million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy aligned with improved but cautious earnings. Revenue remains concentrated in Egypt with no diversification into other regions, which may limit geographic growth opportunities. The improved operational cash flow and positive net income provide a foundation for sustainable cash flow, but the company’s future performance will depend on managing leverage and capital investments effectively. The data suggests cautious optimism for growth supported by investment and operational improvements. | Investment activities in 2023 generated net cash inflows of $120.8 million, a significant decline from $1,012.6 million in 2022, indicating a substantial reduction in investing cash inflows or asset sales. Financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $646.2 million, higher than the $579.6 million outflow in 2022, driven in part by dividend payments of $542.1 million, which may not be sustainable given negative operating cash flows. The net decrease in cash was $565.3 million, reversing the prior year's increase of $447.8 million, signaling cash depletion. Revenue concentration remains heavily focused on Egypt ($199.9 million), with minimal contribution from other regions, suggesting limited geographic diversification. Given the negative profitability, declining asset base, and cash flow challenges, future financial performance may be constrained unless operational improvements and capital structure adjustments occur. The large dividend payout despite losses and negative cash flow may pressure future liquidity. Overall, growth indicators are weak, and cash flow sustainability is at risk, warranting cautious outlook for 2024 absent strategic changes. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks including volatile oil and gas prices impacting revenue and financial positions of partners and stakeholders, uncertain demand due to the energy transition to net zero, and political and fiscal uncertainties in countries of operation, particularly Egypt. There is risk related to the inability to secure new growth opportunities outside Egypt. Market sentiment changes, reduced demand for oil, and reputational damage linked to climate transition are also noted. The Group manages these risks through monitoring commodity prices, maintaining a low-cost portfolio, embedding carbon pricing in investment screening, and maintaining strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation. The Group also monitors energy demand indices and engages with stakeholders to manage reputational risks. | The Group faces market risks including volatile oil and gas prices which impact revenue, cash flow, and contingent payment values. The geopolitical environment, such as Middle East tensions and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, affects supply and demand dynamics. Demand volatility is influenced by industrial activity shifts due to high gas prices in Europe. Political and fiscal uncertainties in countries of operation, especially Egypt and Senegal, pose risks to operations and financial viability. The transition to a lower carbon economy presents transition risks including policy and legal changes (carbon pricing), technology shifts, market demand decline for fossil fuels, and reputational risks. The Group manages these risks through sensitivity analyses, cost reduction initiatives, maintaining a low-cost portfolio, monitoring energy demand indices, and engagement with stakeholders. Emerging macroeconomic risks in Egypt are also noted. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include underperformance of producing assets in Egypt, delays or reductions in cash flow, reserves downgrade or impairment, cost and schedule overruns, HSSE incidents, and reputational damage. There are risks related to operational performance of producing assets, supply chain, and day-to-day operational challenges. The Group mitigates these through active engagement with partners, participation in operational and technical meetings, independent economic analysis, prioritisation of development drilling, reservoir management including water injection, and maintaining high HSSE standards with training and audits. Business continuity and emergency response procedures are regularly tested.

Commodity price risk arises mainly from Egyptian production and is managed by investment program adjustments and sensitivity analyses; no commodity hedging was undertaken. Liquidity risk is managed through cash flow projections, debt and equity financing plans, and active portfolio management, with particular focus on receivables from EGPC in Egypt. Credit risk is mitigated by credit assessments of customers and counterparties, diversification of investments, and limits on counterparty exposure. Foreign currency risk is managed by matching receipts and payments in the same currency, holding cash in functional currencies, and occasional use of derivatives. The Group maintains adequate liquidity and monitors financial liabilities maturity. The going concern assessment includes downside scenarios with lower oil prices and production reductions, confirming sufficient financial headroom outside Egypt. The Egypt subsidiary has limited headroom and depends on resolution of receivables issues. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks include regulatory compliance with oil and gas laws and regulations in Egypt, adherence to HSSE policies, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, tax legislation, and environmental regulations related to climate change. The Group mitigates these risks through strong corporate governance, regular audits, training programs on anti-corruption and compliance, maintaining positive relationships with governments and stakeholders, and monitoring political and regulatory environments. The Audit Committee oversees risk management and internal controls, including whistleblowing policies. The Group also complies with UK Corporate Governance Code and reporting standards, and actively manages climate-related regulatory risks through risk registers and scenario analysis. | Compliance risks include regulatory compliance with health, safety, environmental, and security policies, legal and tax obligations, anti-bribery and corruption laws (notably UK Bribery Act and Egyptian Penal Code), data protection regulations including GDPR, and environmental regulations such as those related to pollution and emissions.

| Risk assessment procedures | The Group employs a comprehensive risk management framework aligned with ISO 31000 and the FRC guidance on risk management and internal control. Risk identification and assessment are conducted through a bottom-up approach with top-down support, using risk registers at Group, asset, project, country, department, and functional levels. The Group Risk Management Process systematically identifies, analyses, assesses, treats, and monitors business risks. The principal risk dashboard is updated before each Audit Committee meeting, where changes to operational and corporate risks are discussed and challenged. Climate-related risks are identified using tools such as hazard identification, social impact assessments, and environmental hazard identification, classified in line with TCFD physical and transition risks. Risks are scored on impact and probability (1-5 scale), with material risks scoring 15 or above out of 25. The Group applies the 4Ts (Tolerate, Treat, Transfer, Terminate) to risks, with 'Treat' risks requiring assigned mitigation actions. The Board completed a robust assessment of emerging and principal risks in 2024, including climate-related risks. The risk registers are maintained using Microsoft Excel. | The company employs a comprehensive risk management framework aligned with ISO 31000 and the COSO framework.

# Section 6: Future Outlook

## S6.1: Strategic Direction

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mergers and Acquisition | Capricorn's M&A strategy focuses on developing scale and longevity outside Egypt to increase cash flows and deliver consistent shareholder returns. The company aims to diversify and expand operations by leveraging core corporate capabilities to identify, acquire, and exploit the right assets in the right locations. Currently, Capricorn is evaluating M&A opportunities in the UK North Sea and the MENA region against strict strategic, financial, and returns criteria. The company also explores strategic investments and partnerships to enhance shareholder value. No specific deal values were disclosed for new acquisitions, but the company completed a $50m disposal of the Sangomar asset to Woodside Energy and is managing a $22.5m receivable from Waldorf Production UK related to a prior UK asset sale. The company concluded its share buyback program in 2024, purchasing approximately $7m of shares during the year, with no current plans to resume buybacks. | The Company is focused on expanding its market share through strategic acquisitions and divestments aligned with its Egypt-focused strategy. In 2023, Capricorn exited all non-Egypt licenses to concentrate capital and resources on the Egyptian portfolio. A key acquisition planned is the completion of a 25% working interest in the Columbus gas condensate field in the UK Central North Sea, expected in Q2 2024. This acquisition is subject to completion, with a $7m payment due to Capricorn if it does not complete by the longstop date. The Company also amended contingent payment arrangements with Waldorf, accelerating cash receipts of $48m in December 2023 and securing a further $24.5m over the next 12 months. Additionally, Capricorn is entitled to a contingent payment of up to $50m from Woodside Energy's Sangomar Field Development in Senegal upon first oil and Brent oil price thresholds being met in 2024. The Company is seeking to defer amounts due under remaining contingent obligations related to its Egyptian asset acquisitions. The strategic rationale is to focus on production optimisation and cash flow generation from core assets, particularly in Egypt, while maximising shareholder value through selective bolt-on acquisitions and divestments. |
| New technologies | Capricorn is committed to technology innovation and decarbonisation initiatives aligned with its net zero commitment by 2040, with interim emission reduction targets of 15% by 2025 and 30% by 2030. The company is implementing decarbonisation technologies at its Egyptian assets, including replacing diesel generators with cleaner-burning gas generators, electrifying well sites and downhole pumps via centralized power generation, and exploring flare gas use for hydrogen production. A CCUS feasibility study has been completed in Egypt. Capricorn actively engages in voluntary carbon markets and has acquired a portfolio of high-quality carbon offsets. The company also uses methane monitoring solutions, including satellite data and FLIR GFX320 cameras for leak detection and maintenance. Exploration drilling resumed in early 2025 targeting conventional and emerging unconventional plays, indicating ongoing R&D and new product development efforts. | Capricorn is committed to technology innovation and clean technology initiatives to support its medium-term net zero roadmap and operational efficiencies.

Methane monitoring solutions and flare gas recovery optimization are ongoing in joint venture operations. R&D investments and innovation programs are linked to ESG and HSSE targets, comprising 15% of Group-wide KPIs. |
| Organisational Restructuring | In 2024, Capricorn underwent significant organizational changes including a culture reset focused on capital returns and exiting non-core activities, resulting in an 80% targeted reduction in general and administrative costs from 2022 to 2025. The Board experienced changes with a new Non-Executive Chair appointed internally and new Non-Executive Director additions, emphasizing diversity and succession planning. The Nomination & Governance Committee actively manages Board and senior management succession with a focus on diversity in gender, social, ethnic, cognitive, and personal strengths. Talent management initiatives include employee engagement via the Employee Voice Forum, reintroduction of the annual employee survey in 2025, well-being programs, flexible working arrangements, and new HR software to improve employee experience. The company promotes a positive workplace culture, equal opportunity, and non-discrimination policies, with ongoing training planned for 2025. The executive team includes experienced leaders with a focus on operational excellence and strategic implementation. | In 2023, Capricorn undertook a significant organisational restructuring to right-size the business in alignment with its refocused strategy on core Egyptian assets. This included compulsory redundancy programs in the UK and Egypt to support a resized asset base and ensure successful strategy implementation. The Company promoted 13 colleagues into new or materially different roles and recruited 10 new employees, all undergoing a robust onboarding process. Talent management focused on active succession planning, mentoring, leadership and management development programs, and annual objective setting. The Board maintains comprehensive succession plans for executive and senior management roles, including contingency plans for unexpected departures. New executive appointments were made post-2023 year-end, including Geoff Probert as Chief Operating Officer and Eddie Ok as Chief Financial Officer, bringing deep industry experience and strong Egypt relationships. The Company increased office attendance to four days per week to enhance collaboration and restructured employee forums to represent the leaner organisation. Learning and development opportunities were maintained, though limited to mandatory training during the reorganisation. Diversity, equality and inclusion remain strategic priorities, with efforts to nurture an inclusive culture and support affected employees through assistance and outplacement programs. |


## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces significant economic challenges primarily linked to its operations in Egypt, including currency devaluation and inflation spikes experienced in 2023 and 2024. Political and fiscal uncertainties in Egypt pose risks of disruption to business activities and pressures on receivables balances. The Egyptian economy showed signs of stabilization in 2024 with improved foreign exchange reserves due to large-scale external cash injections and structural reforms, yet ongoing macroeconomic challenges persist, including impacts from regional conflicts and inflation. Volatile oil and gas prices remain a principal risk affecting revenue and cash flow, with downside scenarios considering oil price crashes to $40/bbl and production volume reductions. The Group also faces liquidity risks related to delays in settlement of trade receivables and increased administration costs. Cost pressures arise from climate-related policy changes and transition costs to net zero, including increased operating and capital expenditures due to climate adaptation needs. The Group manages exposure to commodity price risk without hedging and maintains a conservative balance sheet and self-funding business model to mitigate economic uncertainties. Inflationary pressures and currency devaluation have impacted operating costs and receivables, with ongoing monitoring of capital expenditure commitments against receivables collection. The macroeconomic environment, including geopolitical tensions and energy market dynamics, continues to create uncertainty for future financial outcomes and investment plans. | The Group faces significant economic challenges primarily related to macroeconomic exposures in Egypt, where its primary revenue-generating assets are located. Key economic uncertainties include political and fiscal instability in Egypt, currency devaluation, inflation spikes, and foreign exchange crises exacerbated by regional instability and higher interest rates. The increasing receivables balance from EGPC ($168.7m outstanding as of December 2023) poses liquidity risks and impacts capital availability, potentially reducing drilling activity and reserves. Volatile oil and gas prices remain a medium risk, with fluctuations expected to materially impact cash flow and contingent payment values. The Group also faces cost pressures from transition to lower emissions technology and carbon pricing mechanisms, with internal carbon prices rising from $33/tCO2e in 2024 to $50/tCO2e in 2030. Market conditions are influenced by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, global supply-demand balances, and higher gas prices in Europe, which have eroded industrial activity. The Group's financial viability is sensitive to oil price scenarios, production volume reductions, and delays in receivables settlements. Without resolution of the Egypt receivables issue, the Egypt business is not viable and assets risk impairment. The Group manages liquidity risk through cash flow projections, debt and equity financing plans, and active portfolio management, but remains exposed to uncertainties in Egypt's economic and regulatory environment. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The report does not explicitly address competitive pressures or market competition challenges faced by the Group. There is no direct mention of competitive threats from established players or new market entrants, technological disruption, or industry dynamics challenging the company's market position within the provided text. | The 2023 annual report does not explicitly address competitive pressures or market competition challenges faced by the Group.
