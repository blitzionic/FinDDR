# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue declined significantly from $229.6M in 2022 to $147.8M in 2024, representing a cumulative decrease of approximately 35.6%. The year-over-year revenue drop was 12.5% from 2022 to 2023 and a sharper 26.5% decline from 2023 to 2024. Despite this revenue contraction, gross profit decreased from $81.9M in 2022 to $51.2M in 2024, a 37.5% reduction, which is roughly in line with revenue decline. However, the gross margin percentages are unusually high and volatile, reported at 131.01% in 2022, 189.75% in 2023, and 185.72% in 2024, indicating possible data anomalies or accounting treatments affecting cost of goods sold. Revenue by product/service is heavily concentrated in Egypt, accounting for nearly 99% of total revenue each year ($228.9M in 2022 to $146.8M in 2024), with minimal contribution from Other Capricorn Energy Group ($0.7M to $1.0M). Geographic revenue distribution is entirely Egypt-based with no reported revenue from Mexico or other countries, showing no geographic diversification and increasing reliance on the Egyptian market. Overall, the company faces declining top-line sales primarily from its core Egyptian operations with stable but unusually high gross margins. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved dramatically from deeply negative levels of (59.06%) in 2022 and (43.48%) in 2023 to a positive 20.37% in 2024. This reflects a turnaround in operating income from a loss of $135.6M in 2022 and $87.4M in 2023 to a profit of $30.1M in 2024, despite the revenue decline. Operating expenses decreased from $65.0M in 2022 to $23.9M in 2024, indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency improvements. The operating income to revenue relationship shifted from significant losses absorbing large portions of revenue to a positive operating profit margin, signaling a successful restructuring or cost control effort. The reduction in operating expenses by approximately 63% over three years was a key driver in restoring profitability at the operating level, offsetting the impact of lower revenues. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate exhibited extreme volatility, moving from a positive 18.79% in 2022 to 39.67% in 2023, then sharply to a negative (190.65%) in 2024. The negative tax rate in 2024 suggests the presence of tax benefits, credits, or adjustments that significantly reduced tax expense relative to pre-tax income. Income tax expense fluctuated from -$27.9M in 2022 to -$40.5M in 2023 and then to -$26.5M in 2024, despite the operating income swing from large losses to profit. Net profit margin turned from negative (29.22%) in 2022 and (71.64%) in 2023 to a positive 7.17% in 2024, reflecting the combined effects of improved operating performance and favorable tax impacts. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring items or external factors such as market or geopolitical events in the data, but the tax rate anomalies and operating margin turnaround suggest significant one-off tax or accounting adjustments influencing profitability in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a slight contraction in total assets, decreasing from $667.6 million in 2023 to $619.7 million, indicating a reduction in asset base. Current assets decreased moderately from $383.8 million to $366.8 million, while non-current assets also declined from $280.6 million to $252.9 million. Total liabilities increased slightly from $261.1 million to $270.4 million, driven by a notable rise in current liabilities from $123.4 million to $163.5 million, despite a reduction in non-current liabilities from $137.7 million to $106.9 million. Shareholders' equity declined from $406.5 million to $349.3 million, reflecting the net profit recovery but overall equity erosion compared to 2023. The current ratio decreased from 311.02% to 224.34%, indicating reduced but still strong liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased from 64.23% to 77.41%, suggesting a higher leverage position. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a modestly weaker asset base and equity position with increased short-term liabilities, but liquidity remains adequate. | In 2023, the company experienced a significant contraction in total assets, declining from $1,463.0 million in 2022 to $667.6 million, indicating a substantial reduction in asset base. Both current assets and non-current assets decreased markedly, with current assets falling from $1,041.8 million to $383.8 million and non-current assets from $421.2 million to $280.6 million. Total liabilities also decreased from $341.4 million to $261.1 million, driven by reductions in both current liabilities ($137.2 million to $123.4 million) and non-current liabilities ($204.2 million to $137.7 million). Shareholders' equity contracted sharply from $1,121.6 million to $406.5 million, reflecting the impact of losses and dividend payments. The current ratio declined from an exceptionally high 759.33% to 311.02%, still indicating strong liquidity but a notable decrease in short-term asset coverage relative to liabilities. The debt to equity ratio more than doubled from 30.44% to 64.23%, signaling increased leverage and a shift toward greater reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Overall, the balance sheet shows a weakened financial position with reduced asset base and equity, but manageable liabilities and still strong liquidity levels. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company experienced a significant improvement in profitability in 2024 compared to 2023. Revenue declined from $201.0 million to $147.8 million, a reduction of approximately 26.5%, primarily driven by lower revenue from Egypt ($199.9 million to $146.8 million). Despite lower revenue, gross profit decreased from $75.1 million to $51.2 million, maintaining a high gross margin of 185.72%, slightly down from 189.75%. Operating income reversed from a large loss of $87.4 million in 2023 to a positive $30.1 million in 2024, improving the operating margin from -43.48% to 20.37%. Net profit turned positive at $10.6 million from a net loss of $144.0 million, improving the net profit margin from -71.64% to 7.17%. Return on equity improved from -18.85% to 2.80%, and return on assets improved from -13.52% to 1.65%, indicating a return to profitability and earnings sustainability, albeit at modest levels. The effective tax rate shifted dramatically from 39.67% to a negative 190.65%, reflecting tax benefits or adjustments impacting earnings quality. | The company’s revenue declined from $229.6 million in 2022 to $201.0 million in 2023, a decrease of approximately 12.5%, primarily driven by lower revenue from Egypt ($228.9 million to $199.9 million). Despite the revenue decline, gross profit decreased only slightly from $81.9 million to $75.1 million, but the cost of goods sold increased dramatically from -$71.2 million to -$180.4 million, which appears inconsistent and suggests possible data anomalies or reclassifications. Gross margin improved significantly from 131.01% to 189.75%, which may reflect the unusual cost structure or accounting treatment. Operating expenses decreased slightly from -$65.0 million to -$61.9 million, improving operating margin from -59.06% to -43.48%, indicating better cost control at the operating level despite negative operating income of -$87.4 million. Net profit worsened substantially, moving from a loss of -$67.1 million to a larger loss of -$144.0 million, with net profit margin deteriorating from -29.22% to -71.64%. Return on equity and return on assets were negative at -18.85% and -13.52%, respectively, reflecting poor earnings quality and unsustainable profitability. The effective tax rate increased sharply from 18.79% to 39.67%, further pressuring net income. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved markedly in 2024. Operating expenses were significantly reduced from $61.9 million to $23.9 million, contributing to a positive operating income despite lower revenue. Asset turnover increased from 18.87% to 22.96%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations turned positive at $86.1 million compared to a negative $39.9 million in 2023, reflecting improved cash generation from core business activities. Inventories remained stable at around $8 million, suggesting effective inventory management. The improvement in operating margin to 20.37% and positive operating income signals enhanced cost control and operational leverage. Working capital dynamics show increased current liabilities, which may impact short-term operational liquidity but are offset by strong operational cash flow. | Operating efficiency showed mixed results in 2023. Operating expenses were reduced slightly, contributing to an improved operating margin despite continued operating losses. Asset turnover was high at 18.87, indicating strong revenue generation relative to asset base, although this may be influenced by the significant reduction in total assets. Inventories remained stable at approximately $8.3 million, suggesting consistent inventory management. Net cash from operations turned negative, declining from a positive $14.8 million in 2022 to a negative $39.9 million in 2023, indicating operational cash flow challenges and potential working capital strains. The current ratio, while decreased, remained strong at 311.02%, supporting liquidity for operational needs. Overall, while cost control improved, cash flow from operations deteriorated, signaling operational inefficiencies or working capital management issues. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators present a mixed picture in 2024. The debt to equity ratio increased to 77.41% from 64.23%, indicating higher leverage and potential increased financial risk. The current ratio decreased to 224.34% from 311.02%, showing reduced but still comfortable liquidity. Interest expense decreased from $25.3 million to $20.4 million, but interest coverage ratio turned negative at -147.55% from a very high positive 345.45%, signaling potential difficulties in covering interest obligations from operating earnings. The effective tax rate's negative value (-190.65%) may indicate tax credits or deferred tax assets, which could mask underlying earnings volatility. The increase in current liabilities and negative interest coverage ratio are early warning signs of liquidity and solvency risk that require monitoring. | Financial risk increased in 2023 as evidenced by the doubling of the debt to equity ratio from 30.44% to 64.23%, indicating higher leverage and greater financial risk exposure. Interest expense rose from $18.2 million to $25.3 million, and although interest coverage decreased from 745.05% to 345.45%, it remains relatively high, suggesting the company can still cover interest obligations comfortably. The effective tax rate nearly doubled to 39.67%, which may increase tax-related cash outflows and risk. Liquidity, while reduced, remains strong with a current ratio of 311.02%. However, the negative net cash from operations and large dividend payments ($542.1 million) raise concerns about cash flow sustainability and potential liquidity stress. The combination of increased leverage, higher interest expense, and negative operating cash flow signals elevated financial risk and early warning signs for potential distress. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a reversal from positive net cash from investing of $120.8 million in 2023 to a negative $51.3 million, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities improved significantly, with outflows reducing from $646.2 million to $97.3 million, and dividends paid decreased from $542.1 million to $50.1 million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy and reduced financing outflows. The positive net cash from operations of $86.1 million supports cash flow sustainability. Revenue remains concentrated in Egypt, with no reported diversification into Mexico or other countries, which may limit geographic growth opportunities. Overall, the company appears to be stabilizing its financial position with improved operational cash flow and controlled financing activities, positioning for cautious growth supported by investment spending. | Investment activities in 2023 generated net cash inflows of $120.8 million, a significant decrease from $1,012.6 million in 2022, indicating a slowdown in investing cash inflows or asset sales. Financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $646.2 million, higher than the $579.6 million outflow in 2022, driven in part by substantial dividend payments of $542.1 million, which may pressure cash reserves. The net decrease in cash of $565.3 million contrasts with the prior year's increase, highlighting cash flow challenges. Revenue concentration remains heavily focused on Egypt ($199.9 million), with minimal contribution from other regions, suggesting limited geographic diversification. Given the negative operating cash flow, high dividend payouts, and reduced asset base, future financial performance may face headwinds unless operational cash generation improves or financing strategies adjust. The data suggests cautious outlook with potential liquidity constraints and the need for strategic focus on cash flow sustainability and geographic or segment diversification. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Capricorn Energy operates primarily as an upstream oil and gas producer focused on onshore development and production assets in the Egyptian Western Desert. The company generates revenue mainly through the sale of oil and gas produced from its eight concessions in Egypt, recognizing revenue at the point of sale or delivery. Revenue is derived from oil sales, gas sales, and royalties (notably from Mongolian fields). The business model is self-funding, with production assets providing the cash flow to sustain activities and capital expenditure. Capricorn applies rigorous capital discipline, focusing on operational excellence and cash flow generation to deliver consistent shareholder returns. The company also pursues diversification and expansion through strategic M&A opportunities, particularly in the UK North Sea and MENA region, leveraging its core corporate capabilities. Key products are oil and gas, with a focus on liquids-rich production in Egypt. The company emphasizes maintaining a conservative balance sheet and aligning capital expenditure with cash flow receipts, particularly from its Egyptian operations. | The company's primary business model is focused on oil and gas production and development, primarily through an asset-focused partnership approach. Capricorn generates revenue mainly from the sale of oil and gas produced from its interests in eight concessions in Egypt, based on entitlement interests. Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for oil and at the delivery point for gas, with prices linked to Brent oil prices and fixed gas prices respectively. The company has shifted its core focus from exploration to production optimisation and cash flow generation, transferring operatorship to partners and focusing on non-operated production bases such as in the UK North Sea. Revenue streams include oil sales, gas sales, and royalties from production in other regions like Mongolia. The company also generates other income related to tax entitlements under concession agreements. Capital expenditure is directed towards development and production assets, with exploration costs now expensed as incurred unless wells are successful and commercial reserves are established. The business model emphasizes maintaining a strong balance sheet, prioritizing investments based on returns, and maximizing shareholder value through production optimisation and cost control. |
| Market Position | Capricorn Energy is a focused upstream oil and gas producer with its key market being Egypt, where it operates eight producing concessions in the Western Desert. The company is a significant player in this region, generating $146.8 million in oil and gas revenue in 2024 from net entitlement production of 3.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), with approximately 39% liquids. About 94% of its revenue in Egypt is from sales to a single customer, the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). Capricorn is positioned as a market leader or established operator in the Egyptian onshore oil and gas sector, with a clear strategy to maximize asset value and improve operational performance. The company is actively negotiating improved concession agreement terms with EGPC to incentivize investment and production growth. Outside Egypt, Capricorn is a niche player with minimal operations, having exited non-core activities such as Mexico in 2024, and is evaluating M&A opportunities to diversify and expand. The company has a strong competitive advantage through its self-funding business model, operational expertise in Egypt, and strengthened relationships with JV partners and the Egyptian government. Specific market share percentages are not disclosed, but Capricorn's focus and scale in Egypt position it as a key upstream producer in that market. | Capricorn Energy holds a material production base in Egypt, operating eight producing concessions in the Western Desert region.

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks including volatile oil and gas prices impacting revenue and financial positions of partners and stakeholders, uncertain demand due to the energy transition to net zero, and political and fiscal uncertainties in countries of operation, particularly Egypt. There is risk from failure to secure new growth opportunities outside Egypt. Market sentiment changes and reduced demand for oil due to climate-related policy changes and reputational damage are also noted. The Group manages these risks by maintaining a low-cost portfolio, embedding carbon pricing in investment screening, monitoring energy demand indices, and maintaining strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation. The Group also monitors political and regulatory environments and maintains positive relationships with governments and stakeholders. | The Group faces market risks including volatile oil and gas prices which impact revenue, cash flow, and contingent payment values. The geopolitical environment, such as Middle East tensions and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, affects supply and demand dynamics. Demand volatility is influenced by industrial activity shifts due to high gas prices in Europe. Political and fiscal uncertainties in countries of operation, especially Egypt and Senegal, pose risks to operations and financial outcomes. The transition to a lower carbon economy presents transition risks including policy and legal changes (carbon pricing), technology shifts, market demand decline for fossil fuels, and reputational risks. The Group manages these through sensitivity analyses, cost reduction initiatives, maintaining strong financial headroom, monitoring energy demand indices, and embedding carbon pricing in investment screening. The Group also monitors emerging macroeconomic risks in Egypt and maintains positive government relationships to mitigate political and fiscal risks. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include underperformance of producing assets in Egypt, delays or reductions in cash flow, reserves downgrade or impairment, cost and schedule overruns, HSSE incidents, and reputational damage. There are risks related to operational performance of producing assets, supply chain, and day-to-day operational challenges. The Group mitigates these by engaging actively with partners, participating in operational and technical meetings, conducting independent economic analysis, prioritizing economic projects, and maintaining high HSSE standards including training, audits, and emergency response procedures. Climate-related physical risks such as drought and heat stress may increase operational costs and impact workforce productivity, with mitigation including water conservation, diversification of water sources, and workplace cooling measures. | Operational risks include underperformance of producing assets in the UK and Egypt, failure to replace long-term reserves and resources, and health, safety, environment, and security (HSSE) risks such as serious injury, environmental impacts, and regulatory penalties.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces significant economic challenges primarily related to its operations in Egypt, including currency devaluation, inflation spikes, and political and fiscal uncertainties that could impact business activities and receivables balances. Macroeconomic factors such as the Egyptian economy's stabilization, foreign exchange reserves recovery, and structural reforms have improved payment regularity, but ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and global inflationary pressures continue to pose risks. Volatile oil and gas prices remain a principal risk affecting revenue and debt availability, with downside scenarios considering oil price crashes to $40/bbl and production volume reductions. The Group also faces liquidity risks due to delays in trade receivables settlements and increased administration costs. Cost pressures arise from climate-related policy changes, transition to net zero markets, and increased operating and capital expenditures due to physical climate risks like drought and heat stress. The Group manages these risks through capital discipline, self-funding business models, and sensitivity analyses incorporating commodity price fluctuations and carbon pricing assumptions. Despite these challenges, the Group forecasts sufficient financial headroom through 2028 under various downside scenarios. | The Group faces significant economic challenges primarily related to macroeconomic exposures in Egypt, where its primary revenue-generating assets are located. Key economic uncertainties include political and fiscal instability in Egypt, currency devaluation, inflation spikes, and foreign exchange crises impacting trade receivables and capital availability. The increasing receivables balance from EGPC ($168.7m outstanding as of December 2023) poses liquidity risks and threatens the viability of the Egypt business without a payment plan. Volatile oil and gas prices continue to impact cash flow and contingent payment values, with ongoing geopolitical tensions (e.g., Ukraine and Gaza crises) contributing to price fluctuations. Cost pressures arise from transition to lower emissions technology and carbon pricing mechanisms, with carbon prices expected to rise to $50/tCO2e by 2030. The Group also faces risks from delays in development drilling in Egypt due to suspended capital expenditure until receivables issues are resolved, potentially leading to reserves downgrades. Broader economic challenges include constrained access to capital, higher interest rates, and regional instability affecting tourism and remittances in Egypt. The Group manages liquidity risk through cash flow projections and active portfolio management but notes limited headroom in Egypt and potential lender control if debt obligations are unmet. Overall, economic uncertainties related to Egypt's macroeconomic environment, commodity price volatility, and transition costs present material risks to revenue, profitability, and operational continuity. |
