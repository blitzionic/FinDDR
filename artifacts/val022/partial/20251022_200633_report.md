# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Capricorn Energy PLC's revenue has shown a declining trend from 229.6 million USD in 2022 to 201.0 million USD in 2023, and further down to 147.8 million USD in 2024. Despite this decline, the gross margin remained relatively stable and high, slightly decreasing from 131.01% in 2022 to 129.65% in 2023 and 128.15% in 2024, indicating strong profitability on direct costs. Revenue by product shows a consistent decrease in oil sales from 181.4 million USD in 2022 to 111.6 million USD in 2024, and gas sales also declined from 47.5 million USD to 35.2 million USD over the same period. Royalty income remained minimal but slightly increased from 0.7 million USD in 2022 to 1.0 million USD in 2024. Geographically, the vast majority of revenue is generated from Egypt, which decreased from 228.9 million USD in 2022 to 146.8 million USD in 2024, while revenue from other Capricorn Energy Group regions remained negligible and stable around 1 million USD. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a significant improvement from negative margins of (59.06%) in 2022 and (43.48%) in 2023 to a positive 20.37% in 2024, reflecting a turnaround in operating efficiency. Operating income improved dramatically from a loss of (135.6) million USD in 2022 and (87.4) million USD in 2023 to a positive 30.1 million USD in 2024, despite the declining revenue. Operating expenses decreased from 65.0 million USD in 2022 to 23.9 million USD in 2024, indicating effective cost management and expense control. The reduction in operating expenses outpaced the decline in revenue, contributing to the improved operating margin and income. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate experienced a significant fluctuation, moving from a high positive rate of 79.49% in 2022 to 39.67% in 2023, and then to a negative rate of (190.65%) in 2024, which positively impacted net profit in 2024 by reducing tax expenses or generating tax benefits. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. The negative effective tax rate in 2024 likely contributed to the turnaround from net losses in 2022 and 2023 to a net profit of 10.6 million USD in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Capricorn Energy PLC's total assets decreased to $619.7 million from $667.6 million in 2023, reflecting a reduction primarily in non-current assets (down from $280.6 million to $252.9 million). Current assets also declined slightly to $366.8 million. Total liabilities increased marginally to $270.4 million from $261.1 million, driven by a rise in current liabilities from $123.4 million to $163.5 million, while non-current liabilities decreased to $106.9 million. Shareholders' equity declined to $349.3 million from $406.5 million, indicating a contraction in net worth. The current ratio fell from 311.02% to 224.34%, signaling reduced liquidity but still a comfortable buffer above 1. The debt to equity ratio increased from 64.23% to 77.41%, indicating a higher leverage position. Overall, the company shows a moderate decline in asset base and equity with increased short-term liabilities, suggesting a cautious but stable financial health profile with somewhat higher leverage and reduced liquidity compared to 2023. | In 2023, Capricorn Energy PLC experienced a significant contraction in total assets, declining from $1,463.0 million in 2022 to $667.6 million, driven by decreases in both current assets (from $1,041.8 million to $383.8 million) and non-current assets (from $421.2 million to $280.6 million). Total liabilities also decreased from $341.4 million to $261.1 million, with reductions in current liabilities ($137.2 million to $123.4 million) and non-current liabilities ($204.2 million to $137.7 million). However, shareholders' equity sharply declined from $1,121.6 million to $406.5 million, reflecting retained earnings reduction from $678.8 million to $444.2 million. The current ratio dropped substantially from 759.33% to 311.02%, indicating a decrease in liquidity but still maintaining a strong current asset coverage over current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio more than doubled from 30.44% to 64.23%, signaling a higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company’s financial health shows a marked shrinkage in asset base and equity, with increased leverage and reduced liquidity, suggesting a more constrained financial position in 2023 compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined significantly by 26.5% from $201.0 million in 2023 to $147.8 million in 2024, with oil sales dropping from $159.1 million to $111.6 million and gas sales from $40.8 million to $35.2 million. Despite lower revenue, gross profit decreased less sharply to $51.2 million from $75.1 million, maintaining a strong gross margin of 128.15%, slightly down from 129.65%. Operating income improved dramatically from a loss of $87.4 million in 2023 to a positive $30.1 million in 2024, with operating margin turning positive at 20.37% from a negative 43.48%. Net profit swung from a substantial loss of $144.0 million to a modest profit of $10.6 million, improving net margin from -71.64% to 7.17%. Return on equity and assets turned positive but remain low at 2.80% and 1.65%, respectively, indicating early-stage profitability recovery. The effective tax rate is negative at -190.65%, reflecting tax benefits or adjustments impacting earnings quality. Overall, Capricorn Energy PLC showed a strong turnaround in profitability and earnings quality in 2024 despite lower revenues. | Revenue declined by 12.5% from $229.6 million in 2022 to $201.0 million in 2023, with oil sales dropping from $181.4 million to $159.1 million and gas sales from $47.5 million to $40.8 million, partially offset by a slight increase in royalty income. Gross profit decreased from $81.9 million to $75.1 million, but the gross margin remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from 131.01% to 129.65%. Operating income improved from a large loss of $135.6 million to a smaller loss of $87.4 million, improving the operating margin from -59.06% to -43.48%. Despite this, net profit deteriorated significantly, with net losses widening from $67.1 million to $144.0 million, worsening the net profit margin from -29.22% to -71.64%. Return on equity and return on assets were negative at -18.85% and -13.52% respectively, indicating poor earnings quality and negative returns on invested capital. The effective tax rate dropped from 79.49% to 39.67%, reflecting a lower tax burden relative to pre-tax losses. Overall, profitability weakened with deeper net losses despite some operational margin improvement, highlighting challenges in earnings quality and sustainability. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost of goods sold decreased proportionally with revenue, from $59.6 million to $41.6 million, supporting a stable gross margin. Operating expenses were significantly reduced from $61.9 million to $23.9 million, indicating effective cost control. Asset turnover improved from 18.87% to 22.96%, showing better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations turned positive at $86.1 million compared to a negative $39.9 million in 2023, reflecting improved operational cash flow and working capital management. Inventories remained stable at around $8 million, suggesting consistent inventory management. The positive operational cash flow combined with reduced operating expenses and improved asset turnover indicates enhanced operational efficiency in 2024. | Cost of goods sold decreased from $71.2 million to $59.6 million, and operating expenses reduced from $65.0 million to $61.9 million, indicating some cost control efforts. Asset turnover was reported at a high 18.87 in 2023 (not available in 2022), suggesting efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue despite the asset base contraction. However, net cash from operations worsened, with cash outflows increasing from $22.0 million in 2022 to $39.9 million in 2023, indicating operational cash flow challenges. Inventories remained stable around $8.3 million, showing no significant inventory buildup. Working capital decreased in line with current assets and liabilities reductions. The negative operating cash flow combined with declining revenue and asset base points to operational inefficiencies and cash generation difficulties in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The increase in debt to equity ratio from 64.23% to 77.41% signals higher financial leverage and potential risk. The current ratio declined from 311.02% to 224.34%, indicating reduced but still adequate liquidity. Interest expense decreased from $25.3 million to $20.4 million, but interest coverage ratio turned negative to -147.55% from a very high positive 345.45%, suggesting earnings before interest and taxes were insufficient to cover interest expenses in 2024, which is a significant risk indicator. The effective tax rate shifted dramatically to a negative figure (-190.65%) from 39.67%, which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces volatility in tax expense recognition. The combination of increased leverage, negative interest coverage, and volatile tax rate points to elevated financial risk and early warning signs that require close monitoring. | Leverage increased notably as debt to equity rose from 30.44% to 64.23%, reflecting higher financial risk due to increased reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Liquidity, while still strong, declined as the current ratio dropped from 759.33% to 311.02%, indicating reduced short-term asset coverage of liabilities. Interest expense increased from $18.2 million to $25.3 million, and although interest coverage decreased from 745.05% to 345.45%, it remains positive but significantly lower, suggesting reduced ability to cover interest costs from operating income. The effective tax rate fell from 79.49% to 39.67%, which may reflect changes in tax strategy or tax base but also indicates variability in tax obligations. The substantial net loss and negative cash flow from operations, combined with increased leverage and interest expense, highlight elevated financial risk and potential early warning signs of distress. |
| Future financial performance projection | Net cash from investing activities turned negative at -$51.3 million in 2024 compared to a positive $120.8 million in 2023, indicating increased investment or capital expenditure outflows. Net cash from financing activities improved significantly to -$97.3 million from -$646.2 million, reflecting reduced financing outflows, including dividends which dropped sharply from $542.1 million to $50.1 million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy. The net decrease in cash was much smaller at -$62.5 million versus -$565.3 million previously, indicating better cash flow sustainability. Revenue remains heavily concentrated in Egypt (99.3% of total revenue), with oil sales as the dominant product, though both declined in 2024. The company’s investment activity and improved operational cash flow suggest a focus on sustaining operations and cautious growth. However, the concentration risk and reduced dividend payments imply a conservative approach to future financial performance with emphasis on liquidity preservation and operational stability. | Investment activity, as reflected by net cash from investing, sharply declined from an inflow of $1,166.3 million in 2022 to a modest inflow of $120.8 million in 2023, indicating a significant reduction in asset sales or investment returns. Net cash from financing outflows increased from $545.8 million to $646.2 million, driven largely by dividend payments of $542.1 million in 2023, which is a new cash outflow compared to zero dividends in 2022. The large dividend payout despite negative earnings and cash flow may pressure future liquidity. Revenue remains heavily concentrated in Egypt ($199.9 million of $201.0 million total), suggesting geographic concentration risk but also focus. The combination of negative operating cash flow, high dividend payments, and reduced investing cash inflows raises concerns about cash flow sustainability. Future performance will depend on the company’s ability to improve operational cash generation, manage leverage, and possibly adjust dividend policy to preserve financial flexibility. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Capricorn Energy operates primarily as a cash flow-focused upstream energy producer, generating revenue through the development and production of oil and gas from onshore assets in the Egyptian Western Desert. The company holds interests in eight producing concessions in Egypt and recognizes revenue from the sale of oil and gas based on entitlement interests. Revenue is generated mainly from domestic sales of oil and gas, with oil sales recognized at the point of delivery to communal storage tanks or export loading, and gas sales recorded based on volumes accepted by customers. The company also receives other income related to tax entitlement volumes under concession agreements, where income tax is paid on Capricorn's behalf by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) from their share of production. Capricorn's business model focuses on maintaining strong cash flows through operational discipline, optimizing production (particularly liquids-focused operations), and negotiating improved fiscal terms with partners and the Egyptian government to support investment and growth. Outside Egypt, Capricorn is evaluating M&A opportunities to diversify and expand operations, particularly in the UK North Sea and MENA region, but the core revenue generation remains from oil and gas production in Egypt. | The company's primary business model is upstream oil and gas production and development, focusing on non-operated production and development activities. Capricorn generates revenue primarily through the sale of oil and gas from its producing interests, mainly in Egypt, based on entitlement interests under production sharing contracts. Revenue is recognized from oil sales at the point ownership passes to the buyer, and from gas sales based on volumes accepted by customers. The company also receives other income related to tax entitlement volumes under concession agreements in Egypt, where income tax is paid on Capricorn's behalf by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) through additional hydrocarbon production allocated to Capricorn. Capricorn has shifted its core focus from exploration to production optimisation and cash flow generation, transferring exploration operatorship to partners and concentrating on maximising value from its Egyptian assets and growing a non-operated production base in the UK North Sea. The company manages a portfolio of producing concessions, primarily in Egypt, and has exited non-core international exploration licenses to focus capital and resources on its core assets. Revenue for 2023 was $201.0 million, with $199.9 million from Egypt operations. The business model emphasizes maintaining a strong balance sheet, prioritizing investments based on returns, and working collaboratively with partners and governments to optimise production and improve concession terms. |
| Market Position | Capricorn Energy is positioned as a focused upstream oil and gas producer with a strong presence in the Egyptian Western Desert, operating eight concessions. The company is a significant player in the Egyptian onshore oil and gas market, with 94.0% of its 2024 Egypt segment revenue ($138.0 million) derived from sales to a single customer, indicating a concentrated market position. While specific market share percentages are not disclosed, Capricorn is described as having a self-funding Egyptian asset base and is engaged in negotiations with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) to amend concession agreements to consolidate and extend field lives, which is expected to enhance production and reserves. The company is regarded as a market leader or at least a key player in its core Egyptian market, focusing on maximizing asset value and operational performance. Outside Egypt, Capricorn is a niche player with limited current operations but is actively pursuing strategic expansion through M&A in the UK North Sea and MENA region. Capricorn's competitive advantages include its operational expertise in Egypt, strong relationships with partners and the Egyptian government, a disciplined capital and cost control culture, and a clear strategy to deliver consistent shareholder returns through cash flow generation. | Capricorn Energy holds a significant producing asset base in Egypt, operating eight concessions in the Western Desert onshore region. In 2023, Egypt accounted for the vast majority of the company's revenue ($199.9 million out of $201.0 million total revenue), with 93.1% ($187.1 million) of Egypt segment revenue derived from sales to a single customer, indicating a concentrated market position. The company is positioned as a non-operated production and development business with a focus on maximising shareholder value from its Egyptian assets. Capricorn has exited other international exploration licenses, including Mexico and Suriname, to concentrate on Egypt and the UK North Sea. In the UK, Capricorn holds a non-operated 25% working interest in the Columbus natural gas field in the Central North Sea, acquired as part of a contingent payment arrangement. The company is not explicitly described as a market leader or challenger with specific market share percentages in the report, but its strategic focus and asset base in Egypt suggest a strong and established presence in that market. Capricorn's competitive advantages include strong partner and government relationships, technical expertise, and a collaborative culture focused on production optimisation and cash flow generation. |


# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Capricorn Energy PLC faces market risks primarily from volatile oil and gas prices which can reduce future cash flow and constrain joint venture partner capital. The Group is exposed to commodity price risk mainly from its Egyptian production, which could adversely affect revenue and debt availability. There is also risk from declining oil demand and faster-than-expected shifts away from gas, impacting prices and market sentiment. Political and fiscal uncertainties in countries of operation, especially Egypt, pose risks of loss of value and uncertain financial outcomes. The Group mitigates these risks through sensitivity analyses, cost initiatives, maintaining a low-cost portfolio, embedding low oil and gas prices and carbon prices in investment screening, and maintaining strong balance sheets with low leverage and strong free cash flow. The Group actively monitors energy demand indices and policy developments, maintains positive relationships with governments, and engages in industry initiatives. The inability to secure new growth opportunities outside Egypt is also a noted risk. Additionally, reputational risks arise from public perception of the oil and gas industry's net zero ambitions, mitigated by transparency and compliance with high reporting standards. | Capricorn Energy PLC faces market risks primarily from volatile oil and gas prices, which can reduce future cash flow, contingent payment values, and constrain joint venture partner capital. The gas price environment is expected to remain volatile due to geopolitical tensions and supply-demand imbalances, impacting European and UK gas prices and industrial activity. There is also risk from political and fiscal uncertainties, especially in Egypt, where macroeconomic challenges and currency devaluation could disrupt operations and increase receivables balances. The company also faces risks related to the transition to a lower carbon economy, including policy and legal changes such as carbon pricing, technology shifts increasing costs, market demand declines for oil and gas, and reputational risks. Demand volatility and industry trends, including the transition to Net Zero, pose future challenges and costs. Mitigation includes sensitivity analyses, cost initiatives, maintaining sufficient financial headroom, engagement with partners and EGPC to resolve receivables, monitoring energy demand indices, embedding carbon pricing in investment screening, and maintaining a low-cost portfolio resilient to climate scenarios. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include underperformance or delays in producing assets, which can lead to reduced cash flow, reserves downgrades, cost and schedule overruns, and negative impacts on asset value. The Group works closely with joint venture partners to mitigate these risks by active engagement, participation in operational and technical meetings, and conducting independent economic analyses on investments. There is a principal risk related to lack of adherence to HSSE policies, which could cause serious injury, environmental impacts, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties. Mitigation includes comprehensive HSSE training, audits, emergency response procedures, and third-party security specialists. The Group also faces risks from irregular settlements of trade receivables in Egypt affecting cash flow and capital investment. Business continuity and emergency response capabilities are regularly tested. The Group manages risks through a robust risk management framework aligned with ISO 31000, embedding risk identification and mitigation from top to bottom across operations. Climate-related physical risks such as extreme weather events are also considered operational risks, with mitigation including decarbonisation projects and energy efficiency improvements. | Operational risks include underperformance of producing assets in the UK and Egypt, with impacts such as delays or reductions in cash flow, reserves downgrades, cost and schedule overruns, HSSE incidents, and reputational damage. Specific operational challenges in Egypt include system constraints and electric submersible pump performance issues causing production below guidance. There is also risk from lack of adherence to health, safety, environment, and security policies, which could lead to serious injury or death, environmental impacts, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. Emergency preparedness and crisis management are critical, with partners required to follow Capricorn's Emergency Response Plan. Cybersecurity risks are also significant, with ongoing vigilance, external specialist support, and compliance with data protection regulations.

| Risk assessment procedures | Capricorn Energy PLC employs a comprehensive risk management framework aligned with ISO 31000 and the FRC guidance on risk management and internal control. The Group uses a bottom-up approach with top-down support and challenge, maintaining risk registers at Group, country, department, project, asset, and functional levels. Risks are identified through discussions at Board, management team, country, and functional levels. The Group applies a risk assessment process that includes assigning impact and probability scores (1 to 5) to risks, with material risks defined as those scoring 15 or above out of 25. Climate-related risks are classified as physical and transition risks and are integrated into the overall risk management process. Tools used include hazard identification, social impact assessments, environmental hazard identification, and Microsoft Excel for maintaining risk registers. The Group applies the '4Ts' (Tolerate, Treat, Transfer, Terminate) to manage risks. The Audit Committee reviews the Group's principal risks at each meeting, challenges management on risk classifications, and monitors progress on internal audits and risk management plans. The Board and Audit Committee conduct annual reviews of management's formal internal controls assessment and the effectiveness of internal controls. Scenario analysis aligned with TCFD recommendations is used to assess climate-related risks and portfolio resilience under different climate scenarios. | Capricorn Energy PLC employs a Group Risk Management Process that systematically identifies, analyses, assesses, treats, and monitors business risks at operating, asset, country, and company levels using risk registers.

# Section 6: Future Outlook

## S6.1: Strategic Direction

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mergers and Acquisition | Capricorn's M&A strategy focuses on developing scale and longevity outside Egypt to increase cash flows and deliver consistent shareholder returns. The Company aims to diversify and expand operations by leveraging core corporate capabilities to identify, acquire, and exploit the right assets in the right locations. Currently, Capricorn is evaluating M&A opportunities in the UK North Sea and the MENA region against strict strategic, financial, and returns criteria. The Company also explores strategic investments and partnerships to enhance shareholder value. No specific deal values or targets were disclosed, but the Company completed the disposal of the Sangomar asset to Woodside Energy, receiving $50 million in January 2025. The share buyback program authorized by the Board concluded in 2024 with approximately $7 million spent on repurchasing shares, and there are no current plans to resume it. | The Company’s 2023 strategic review focused on exiting non-Egyptian licenses to concentrate on the Egyptian portfolio.

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Capricorn Energy PLC faces significant economic challenges primarily linked to the macroeconomic environment in Egypt, where its main revenue-generating assets are located. The Egyptian economy experienced currency devaluation and inflation spikes in 2023 and 2024, creating risks of further political or fiscal instability that could impact business activities and pressure receivables balances. The Group's liquidity and capital expenditure are sensitive to irregular settlements of trade receivables from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), with a substantial outstanding receivables balance of $180 million as of December 2024. Although collections improved in early 2024, there was a deterioration in the second half of the year, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainty. Additional economic risks include volatile oil and gas prices, which affect revenue and cash flow, and the potential for increased costs, including administration costs and contingent tax liabilities (e.g., related to Senegal assets). The Group also faces risks from foreign currency fluctuations, inflationary pressures, and the broader geopolitical environment, including conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, which impact supply chains and market conditions. Despite these challenges, the Group maintains a medium risk appetite and employs mitigation strategies such as maintaining strong government relationships, active receivables management, cost control, and financial forecasting with downside sensitivity analyses. The economic outlook for Egypt is cautiously optimistic due to significant foreign currency injections and structural reforms, but macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties remain material factors influencing Capricorn's financial viability and operational performance. | Capricorn Energy PLC faces significant economic challenges primarily related to macroeconomic exposures in Egypt, where the Group's primary revenue-generating assets are located. Egypt is experiencing a foreign exchange crisis, currency devaluation, inflation spikes, and lower tourism revenues due to regional instability and higher interest rates. These factors contribute to political and fiscal uncertainties that could disrupt or immobilise operations. The Group has a substantial outstanding accounts receivable balance from EGPC ($168.7 million as of December 2023), with ongoing discussions to agree on payment schedules. Delays or failure to resolve this receivables issue threaten the viability of the Egypt business and risk asset impairment. Additionally, volatile oil and gas prices remain a principal risk, with fluctuations expected to continue in 2024, potentially impacting cash flow and contingent payments.
