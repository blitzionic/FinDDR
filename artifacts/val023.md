# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue slightly decreased by 0.78% from €60,073m to €59,604m, then increased by 1.94% to €60,761m in 2024, indicating a modest recovery. Gross profit improved from €24,167m in 2022 to €25,175m in 2023 (+4.23%) and further to €27,370m in 2024 (+8.72%), reflecting better cost control despite fluctuating revenue. However, gross margin declined steadily from 159.77% in 2022 to 157.76% in 2023 and 154.95% in 2024, suggesting rising cost of goods sold relative to revenue. By product, Beauty & Wellbeing revenue grew from €12,250m in 2022 to €13,157m in 2024 (+7.36%), Personal Care remained relatively stable (€13,636m to €13,618m), HomeCare declined slightly (€12,401m to €12,352m), Foods decreased from €13,898m to €13,352m, and Ice Cream increased from €7,888m to €8,282m (+5.03%).

| Operating Efficiency | Operating income declined from €10,755m in 2022 to €9,758m in 2023 (-9.25%) and further to €9,400m in 2024 (-3.68%), despite revenue recovering in 2024. Operating margin followed a downward trend from 17.90% in 2022 to 16.37% in 2023 and 15.47% in 2024, indicating reduced operational efficiency. Operating expenses increased from €14,484m in 2022 to €15,244m in 2023 (+5.23%) and €16,191m in 2024 (+6.26%), outpacing revenue growth and pressuring margins. The ratio of operating income to revenue decreased, reflecting less effective cost management and potential challenges in controlling overheads or scaling operations profitably. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate rose significantly from 20.01% in 2022 to 23.55% in 2023 and further to 28.19% in 2024, increasing the tax burden and reducing net profitability. Income tax expense increased from €2,068m in 2022 to €2,199m in 2023 (+6.34%) and €2,500m in 2024 (+13.69%), despite fluctuating operating income. Net profit declined from €8,269m in 2022 to €7,140m in 2023 (-13.66%) and €6,369m in 2024 (-10.81%), reflecting the combined impact of rising tax rates and decreasing operating income.

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from €75,266m in 2023 to €79,750m, reflecting asset growth driven by both current assets (up from €17,902m to €19,194m) and non-current assets (up from €57,364m to €60,556m).

The effective tax rate increased notably from 23.55% to 28.19%, which contributed to reduced net profitability despite higher gross profit. | Revenue slightly declined by 0.78% from EUR 60,073 million in 2022 to EUR 59,604 million in 2023. Despite this, gross profit increased from EUR 24,167 million to EUR 25,175 million, reflecting improved cost of goods sold management as COGS decreased by 4.14% to EUR 34,429 million. Gross margin slightly decreased from 159.77% to 157.76%, indicating a minor margin compression. Operating income declined by 9.25% to EUR 9,758 million, with operating margin falling from 17.90% to 16.37%, driven by increased operating expenses rising from EUR 14,484 million to EUR 15,244 million. Net profit decreased by 13.67% to EUR 7,140 million, with net profit margin contracting from 13.76% to 11.98%.

| Operational efficiency | Operating margin decreased to 15.47% in 2024 from 16.37% in 2023, indicating some erosion in cost control or increased operating expenses. However, asset turnover slightly improved from 77.87% to 78.39%, showing marginally better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased slightly from €9,426m to €9,519m, supporting operational cash flow stability. Inventories remained relatively flat (€5,119m to €5,177m), suggesting steady working capital management. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with improved asset turnover and stable cash flow but pressure on operating margins. | Operating margin declined to 16.37% in 2023 from 17.90% in 2022, indicating some erosion in cost control or increased operating expenses. Asset turnover was 77.87% in 2023 (not available in 2022), reflecting moderate efficiency in using assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations improved significantly by 29.44% to EUR 9,426 million, indicating strong cash generation despite lower net profit. Inventories decreased from EUR 5,931 million to EUR 5,119 million, suggesting better inventory management. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: margin compression but improved cash flow and asset utilization, indicating effective working capital and cash management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators improved with the debt to equity ratio decreasing from 301.08% to 286.12%, indicating reduced financial risk. The current ratio remained stable at approximately 76%, reflecting consistent liquidity. Interest expense increased slightly from €1,038m to €1,113m, while interest coverage ratio declined from 940.08% to 844.56%, still indicating strong ability to cover interest but with some weakening. The effective tax rate rose from 23.55% to 28.19%, which may signal increased tax burden risk. Overall, financial risk remains moderate with improved leverage but slightly reduced interest coverage and higher tax expense. | Leverage increased slightly as debt to equity rose from 295.04% to 301.08%, signaling marginally higher financial risk. Interest expense increased by 26.85% to EUR 1,038 million, while interest coverage ratio declined from 1314.79% to 940.08%, indicating reduced but still strong ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased to 23.55%, which may reflect changes in tax environment or profitability mix, adding to risk. Liquidity remained stable with a slight improvement in current ratio to 76.16%. The decrease in total assets and equity alongside increased leverage and interest expense suggests a cautious watch on financial risk, though no immediate distress signals are evident. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities showed a significant reduction in net cash used for investing from (€2,294m) in 2023 to (€625m) in 2024, suggesting a more conservative or efficient capital expenditure approach. Net cash from financing remained negative but slightly improved from (€7,193m) to (€6,941m), with dividends paid stable around €4,300m, indicating a consistent dividend policy. Revenue growth in key segments such as Beauty & Wellbeing and Ice Cream increased, while Personal Care slightly declined, signaling potential growth areas. Geographically, The Americas and Europe showed revenue growth, while Asia Pacific Africa declined slightly, indicating shifting market dynamics. Cash flow from operations remains strong and sustainable, supporting ongoing dividend payments and potential future investments. | Investment activities turned negative in 2023 with net cash from investing at EUR (2,294) million compared to a positive EUR 2,453 million in 2022, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing improved to EUR (7,193) million from EUR (8,890) million, reflecting reduced financing outflows. Dividends slightly increased to EUR (4,363) million, showing a stable dividend policy. Revenue by product shows growth in Beauty & Wellbeing and Personal Care segments, while Foods and HomeCare declined, suggesting shifting market dynamics. Geographically, The Americas revenue increased, while Asia Pacific Africa declined, indicating regional growth opportunities and challenges. The strong operational cash flow and ongoing investments suggest sustainable cash flow and potential for growth, but margin pressures and regional shifts warrant monitoring for future performance. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Unilever faces market risks including commodity price risk, currency risk, and interest rate risk.
