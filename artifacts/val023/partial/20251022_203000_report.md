# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Unilever PLC's revenue showed a slight decline from €60,073 million in 2022 to €59,604 million in 2023, followed by a modest recovery to €60,761 million in 2024. Despite this, the gross margin percentage decreased steadily from 159.77% in 2022 to 157.76% in 2023 and further to 154.95% in 2024, indicating a slight erosion in profitability at the gross level. Revenue by product/service reveals that Personal Care remained the largest contributor with €13,618 million in 2024, slightly down from €13,829 million in 2023 but stable compared to €13,636 million in 2022. Foods revenue declined from €13,898 million in 2022 to €13,204 million in 2023 and slightly increased to €13,352 million in 2024. Geographically, Asia Pacific Africa generated the highest revenue but showed a declining trend from €27,504 million in 2022 to €25,991 million in 2024, while The Americas and Europe regions showed growth, with The Americas increasing from €20,905 million in 2022 to €22,491 million in 2024 and Europe from €11,664 million to €12,279 million over the same period. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 17.90% in 2022 to 16.37% in 2023 and further to 15.47% in 2024, reflecting decreasing operating profitability. Operating income decreased from €10,755 million in 2022 to €9,758 million in 2023 and further to €9,400 million in 2024, despite relatively stable revenue levels. Operating expenses increased from €14,484 million in 2022 to €15,244 million in 2023 and €16,191 million in 2024, indicating rising costs that outpaced revenue growth and contributed to margin compression. This suggests challenges in cost management, as the company faced increasing operating expenses while revenue growth was modest, negatively impacting operating income and margin. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 20.01% in 2022 to 23.55% in 2023 and further to 28.19% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profit margins, contributing to a decline in net profit from €8,269 million in 2022 to €6,369 million in 2024. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, indicating that the observed profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance and tax rate changes. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Unilever PLC's total assets increased to EUR 79,750 million from EUR 75,266 million in 2023, reflecting asset growth primarily in non-current assets (EUR 60,556 million vs. EUR 57,364 million). Total liabilities also rose to EUR 57,195 million from EUR 54,502 million, with both current liabilities (EUR 25,234 million) and non-current liabilities (EUR 31,961 million) increasing.

The debt to equity ratio decreased to 286.12% from 301.08%, suggesting a modest improvement in capital structure leverage. Overall, the company shows growth in asset base and equity with stable liquidity and slightly reduced leverage, indicating sound financial health in 2024. | In 2023, Unilever PLC's total assets decreased significantly from €90,047 million in 2022 to €75,266 million, driven by a sharp decline in non-current assets from €89,776 million to €57,364 million, partially offset by a substantial increase in current assets from €271 million to €17,902 million. Total liabilities increased markedly from €12,525 million to €54,502 million, with current liabilities more than doubling from €10,372 million to €23,507 million and non-current liabilities rising from €2,153 million to €30,995 million. Shareholders' equity slightly declined from €19,021 million to €18,102 million, reflecting retained earnings reduction from €27,706 million to €23,359 million. The current ratio improved dramatically from 2.61% to 76.16%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio surged from 65.85% to 301.08%, signaling a significant increase in leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company shows improved liquidity but increased financial risk due to higher leverage and reduced equity base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased modestly by about 1.9% to EUR 60,761 million in 2024 from EUR 59,604 million in 2023. Gross profit improved significantly to EUR 27,370 million from EUR 25,175 million, despite a slight decrease in cost of goods sold. However, operating income declined to EUR 9,400 million from EUR 9,758 million, reflecting higher operating expenses (EUR 16,191 million vs. EUR 15,244 million). Net profit decreased to EUR 6,369 million from EUR 7,140 million, impacted by higher income tax expense (EUR 2,500 million vs. EUR 2,199 million) and increased interest expense (EUR 1,113 million vs. EUR 1,038 million). Margins contracted: gross margin slightly decreased to 154.95% from 157.76%, operating margin fell to 15.47% from 16.37%, and net profit margin declined to 10.48% from 11.98%. Return on equity and assets also declined to 33.44% and 8.22% respectively, down from 38.47% and 8.64%. These trends indicate pressure on profitability and earnings quality despite revenue growth. | Revenue slightly decreased by 0.78% from €60,073 million in 2022 to €59,604 million in 2023. Despite this, gross profit increased from €24,167 million to €25,175 million, improving gross margin slightly from 159.77% to 157.76%. Operating income declined from €10,755 million to €9,758 million, causing operating margin to fall from 17.90% to 16.37%. Net profit decreased by 13.66% from €8,269 million to €7,140 million, with net profit margin dropping from 13.76% to 11.98%. Income before taxes and net profit both declined, while income tax expense increased, raising the effective tax rate from 20.01% to 23.55%. Interest expense rose from €818 million to €1,038 million, negatively impacting profitability. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 stand at 38.47% and 8.64% respectively, indicating reasonable earnings quality despite margin compression and higher costs. |
| Operational efficiency | Unilever's asset turnover improved to 78.39% in 2024 from 72.11% in 2023, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased slightly to EUR 9,519 million from EUR 9,426 million, reflecting stable operational cash flow. Inventories remained nearly flat at EUR 5,177 million compared to EUR 5,119 million, suggesting controlled inventory levels. However, operating expenses rose, which contributed to a decline in operating income. Net cash used in investing activities decreased significantly to EUR (625) million from EUR (2,294) million, indicating reduced investment outflows. Net cash from financing activities slightly decreased to EUR 6,941 million from EUR 7,193 million. Overall, operational efficiency shows improved asset utilization and stable cash generation, but cost control challenges are evident in rising operating expenses. | Cost of goods sold decreased from €35,906 million to €34,429 million, contributing to higher gross profit despite lower revenue. Operating expenses increased from €14,484 million to €15,244 million, indicating some cost pressure. Asset turnover ratio is high at 72.11, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Inventories decreased from €5,931 million to €5,119 million, reflecting better inventory management. Net cash from operations improved significantly from €7,282 million to €9,426 million, demonstrating strong cash generation capability. However, net cash from investing activities turned negative from €2,453 million inflow to €2,294 million outflow, indicating increased investment or asset purchases. Net cash from financing decreased from €8,890 million to €7,193 million. Overall, operational efficiency shows improvement in cash flow generation and asset utilization, though rising operating expenses warrant monitoring. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remains high but improved, with the debt to equity ratio decreasing to 286.12% from 301.08%. The current ratio stayed stable at around 0.76, indicating consistent short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased to EUR 1,113 million from EUR 1,038 million, while interest coverage ratio declined to 844.56% from 940.08%, though it remains very strong, suggesting ample ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased to 28.19% from 23.55%, which may pressure net profitability. The increase in total liabilities and interest expense, combined with a higher tax rate, signals moderate financial risk. No immediate liquidity distress is evident, but the company should monitor rising costs and tax impacts. | The company’s leverage increased substantially, with debt to equity ratio rising from 65.85% to 301.08%, indicating a significant increase in financial risk. Interest expense increased by 26.9% from €818 million to €1,038 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased from 1314.79% to 940.08%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest costs comfortably. The effective tax rate increased from 20.01% to 23.55%, which may pressure net profitability. Current liabilities more than doubled, and total liabilities increased over fourfold, raising liquidity and solvency concerns despite a strong current ratio. The sharp increase in non-current liabilities suggests higher long-term debt or obligations. These factors collectively signal elevated financial risk and warrant close monitoring for potential liquidity or solvency stress. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity appears to have slowed in 2024, with net cash used in investing activities dropping to EUR (625) million from EUR (2,294) million in 2023, potentially indicating a more conservative capital expenditure approach. Net cash from operations remains strong and stable, supporting cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments were maintained at EUR 4,320 million, nearly unchanged from EUR 4,327 million, reflecting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue growth in key segments such as Beauty & Wellbeing and Ice Cream suggests potential growth areas, with Ice Cream revenue increasing to EUR 8,282 million from EUR 7,924 million. Geographically, revenue in The Americas and Europe increased, while Asia Pacific Africa saw a slight decline, which may guide regional strategic focus. Overall, the company is positioned for steady future performance with stable cash flows, controlled investment spending, and targeted growth in select segments and regions. | Investment activity intensified in 2023 as evidenced by a shift from positive net cash from investing (€2,453 million inflow in 2022) to a negative outflow (€2,294 million), indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from operations improved, supporting cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments remained stable, slightly decreasing from €4,356 million to €4,327 million, suggesting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue by product segments showed modest growth in Beauty & Wellbeing and Personal Care, while Home Care and Foods declined slightly; Ice Cream revenue increased marginally. Geographically, revenue decreased in Asia Pacific Africa but increased in The Americas and Europe, indicating shifting regional performance dynamics. These trends suggest Unilever is investing for future growth while maintaining shareholder returns, with geographic and segment diversification potentially supporting stable future financial performance. |
