# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Fevertree Drinks Plc's revenue showed a steady increase from £344.3m in 2022 to £364.4m in 2023, and further to £368.5m in 2024. Despite this growth, gross profit declined from £118.8m in 2022 to £117.0m in 2023 before rising significantly to £138.4m in 2024. The gross margin percentage slightly decreased from 165.50% in 2022 to 167.89% in 2023, then dropped to 162.44% in 2024, indicating some volatility in cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Revenue is overwhelmingly driven by carbonated products, consistently above 99% across all years, with non-carbonated products contributing less than 1%. Geographically, the United States showed strong growth from £95.6m in 2022 to £128.0m in 2024, becoming the largest regional contributor by 2024. The United Kingdom's revenue remained relatively stable around £111m-£116m, while Europe saw a slight decline from £101m in 2022 to £97.2m in 2024. Rest of the world revenue fluctuated slightly but remained around £30m. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 5.71% in 2023 to 8.90% in 2024, recovering to nearly the 8.89% level seen in 2022 after a dip in 2023. Operating income increased from £20.8m in 2023 to £32.8m in 2024, reflecting better operational performance alongside revenue growth. Operating expenses rose from £88.2m in 2022 to £105.6m in 2024, indicating increased investment or cost pressures, but this was offset by higher gross profit leading to improved operating income. The ratio of operating income to revenue improved, signaling enhanced cost management and operational leverage despite rising expenses. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 19.68% in 2022 to 31.27% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profit despite higher operating income. Income tax expense rose from £6.1m in 2022 to £11.1m in 2024, contributing to a net profit decline from £24.9m in 2022 to £24.4m in 2024, with a notable dip to £15.4m in 2023. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Fevertree Drinks Plc demonstrated a stable and slightly improved financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased modestly from £313.7m to £321.9m, driven by growth in both current assets (£225.8m to £230.7m) and non-current assets (£87.9m to £91.2m). Total liabilities slightly decreased from £75.9m to £75.2m, with a reduction in non-current liabilities (£15.1m to £13.7m) offsetting a small increase in current liabilities (£60.8m to £61.5m). Shareholders' equity rose from £237.8m to £246.7m, supported by an increase in retained earnings (£183.1m to £191.1m). The current ratio improved marginally from 371.38% to 375.12%, indicating strong liquidity and an excellent ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio decreased slightly from 31.92% to 30.48%, reflecting a conservative capital structure with low leverage. Overall, the company maintains a robust balance sheet with strong equity base, ample liquidity, and manageable liabilities, supporting financial health in 2024. | In 2023, Fevertree Drinks Plc's total assets slightly increased to £313.7m from £311.6m in 2022, indicating stable asset base growth. Current assets decreased marginally to £225.8m from £229.1m, while non-current assets rose to £87.9m from £82.5m, suggesting some investment in long-term assets. Total liabilities increased slightly to £75.9m from £72.4m, driven by a rise in current liabilities to £60.8m from £57.3m, with non-current liabilities stable at £15.1m. Shareholders' equity slightly declined to £237.8m from £239.2m, reflecting retained earnings decrease to £183.1m from £184.8m. The current ratio decreased to 371.38% from 399.83%, indicating a slight reduction in liquidity but still a strong short-term financial position. Debt to equity ratio increased slightly to 31.92% from 30.27%, showing a modest increase in leverage but still a conservative capital structure overall. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Fevertree Drinks Plc showed improved profitability in 2024. Revenue increased slightly by 1.1% from £364.4m to £368.5m. Cost of goods sold decreased significantly from £247.4m to £230.1m, resulting in a gross profit increase from £117.0m to £138.4m. Despite a rise in operating expenses from £96.2m to £105.6m, operating income grew substantially by 57.7% from £20.8m to £32.8m. Net profit increased by 58.4% from £15.4m to £24.4m. Margins improved notably: operating margin rose from 5.71% to 8.90%, and net profit margin increased from 4.23% to 6.62%, indicating enhanced earnings quality. Return on equity improved from 6.46% to 10.07%, and return on assets increased from 4.93% to 7.68%, reflecting more efficient use of capital and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate remained stable around 31%. Overall, the company delivered stronger profitability and higher quality earnings in 2024. | Revenue increased by 5.8% to £364.4m in 2023 from £344.3m in 2022, showing top-line growth. However, gross profit declined slightly to £117.0m from £118.8m, with gross margin improving marginally to 167.89% from 165.50%, indicating stable cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. Operating income decreased significantly to £20.8m from £30.6m, with operating margin falling to 5.71% from 8.89%, reflecting higher operating expenses (£96.2m vs £88.2m). Net profit declined sharply to £15.4m from £24.9m, with net profit margin dropping to 4.23% from 7.23%. Income tax expense increased to £6.8m from £6.1m, raising the effective tax rate to 30.63% from 19.68%, which negatively impacted net earnings. Return on equity and assets were 6.46% and 4.93% respectively in 2023, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and asset base. Overall, earnings quality weakened due to margin compression and higher tax burden despite revenue growth. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved markedly in 2024. The company reduced cost of goods sold by £17.3m while increasing revenue slightly, which boosted gross profit. However, operating expenses increased by £9.4m, suggesting some investment or cost pressures. Asset turnover remained stable, slightly decreasing from 116.55% to 115.95%, indicating consistent revenue generation relative to asset base. Inventories decreased significantly from £67.6m to £45.8m, suggesting better inventory management or lower stock levels. Net cash from operations turned positive and strong at £70.2m compared to a negative £3.8m in 2023, reflecting improved cash generation from core business activities and working capital management. Despite increased investing outflows (£10.8m vs £7.6m), the company maintained positive operational cash flow, supporting liquidity and operational sustainability. | Cost control weakened in 2023 as operating expenses rose to £96.2m from £88.2m, outpacing revenue growth. Inventory increased to £67.6m from £60.1m, which may indicate slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. Asset turnover was strong at 116.55%, reflecting efficient use of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations turned negative to (£3.8m) from positive £8.5m in 2022, signaling operational cash flow challenges. Working capital slightly decreased as current assets fell and current liabilities rose. Net cash used in investing activities decreased to (£7.6m) from (£10.0m), indicating reduced investment outflows. Cash flow from financing activities improved to (£23.2m) from (£70.7m), largely due to lower dividend payments (£19.1m vs £68.8m). Overall, operational efficiency declined with cash flow pressures despite asset utilization remaining high. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators suggest low risk for Fevertree Drinks Plc in 2024. The debt to equity ratio decreased slightly to 30.48%, indicating low leverage and a conservative capital structure. Interest expense remained minimal and stable at £0.6m, while interest coverage ratio improved significantly from 3466.67% to 5466.67%, showing strong ability to meet interest obligations comfortably. The current ratio remained very high at 375.12%, indicating excellent short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate was stable at 31.27%, with no indication of tax-related risk changes. The slight increase in current liabilities was offset by strong current assets and cash flow. No significant financial distress signals or liquidity risks are evident. However, the increase in operating expenses and investing outflows should be monitored for potential future impact. | Leverage increased slightly with debt to equity rising to 31.92% from 30.27%, but remains moderate. Liquidity remains strong though current ratio declined to 371.38% from 399.83%, still indicating ample current assets to cover liabilities. Interest expense increased to £0.6m from £0.4m, and interest coverage ratio decreased significantly to 3466.67% from 7650.00%, reflecting reduced but still very comfortable ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate rose sharply to 30.63% from 19.68%, representing a notable tax burden increase that could pressure net profitability. Negative operating cash flow in 2023 is an early warning sign of potential liquidity stress if sustained. Increased inventories and reduced cash flow from operations also suggest working capital management risks. No other explicit financial risks are evident from the data. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Fevertree Drinks Plc appears well-positioned for sustainable financial performance. The company generated strong net cash from operations (£70.2m), which more than covers dividends paid (£19.6m) and investing activities (£10.8m), indicating cash flow sustainability. The stable dividend payout suggests a consistent shareholder return policy. Investment outflows increased slightly, signaling ongoing capital expenditure or growth initiatives. Geographically, revenue growth was strongest in the United States (£128.0m in 2024 vs £117.0m in 2023), while the UK and Europe saw declines, suggesting a strategic focus or opportunity in the US market. The product mix remained heavily weighted towards carbonated products (99.5%), indicating limited diversification but strong market positioning. Overall, the company’s strong cash flow, conservative leverage, and geographic revenue shifts suggest positive prospects, though monitoring investment returns and regional market dynamics will be important. | Investment activity in 2023 decreased as net cash used in investing fell to (£7.6m) from (£10.0m), possibly indicating a more cautious capital expenditure approach. The significant reduction in dividends to £19.1m from £68.8m suggests a more conservative dividend policy, likely to preserve cash amid profitability and cash flow pressures. Revenue growth was driven by the United States and Europe, with US revenue increasing to £117m from £95.6m and Europe to £105.4m from £101m, while UK and Rest of World revenues declined slightly. The product mix remained heavily carbonated (99.2%), with a slight increase in non-carbonated products to 0.8%, indicating limited diversification. Given the negative operating cash flow and margin compression, future financial performance may depend on improved cost control and working capital management. The stable asset base and moderate leverage provide capacity for future growth investments if operational efficiencies improve. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces significant competition in the mixer beverage category, with risks of intensified competition in core markets through aggressive pricing, marketing strategies, new brand introductions, or acquisitions by competitors. Macroeconomic volatility including global inflation, cost of living crises, geopolitical conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East), and potential tariffs pose risks to economic conditions in key markets, potentially impacting consumer confidence and demand. Consumer behavior trends such as premiumisation and long mixed drinks are opportunities but also require continued investment to maintain market share. The Group mitigates these risks through its first mover advantage, product quality, brand strength, diverse territorial and channel mix, significant investment in product innovation, sales force, and supply chain partnerships. The Group also expects to maintain pricing power to offset input cost inflation where appropriate. | Fever-Tree faces market risks including foreign exchange risk due to operations in the USA and Europe with transactions in USD and EUR, managed through forward contracts and hedging. The Group is exposed to competition from other beverage companies, with aggressive pricing and marketing strategies in core markets, mitigated by first mover advantage, product quality, brand strength, and investment in innovation and sales capabilities. Macroeconomic volatility including global inflation, geopolitical conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East), Brexit, and political uncertainty pose risks to economic conditions in key markets, potentially impacting consumer demand and pricing power. Climate-related reputational and market risks arise from changing societal expectations and conscious consumerism, addressed through sustainable marketing claims and net zero roadmap development. |
| Operational Risks | The Group operates an asset-light, outsourced business model relying on third-party bottlers, canners, logistics, and distribution partners, and depends on key raw material suppliers with limited sources (e.g., quinine, fresh green ginger). Disruptions in supply chain, production, storage, or distribution could impact revenue and costs. Inflation in raw materials and logistics costs is a continuing challenge. The Group mitigates these risks by working with multiple bottling partners across regions, installing new production lines, maintaining buffer stocks of key ingredients and packaging materials, entering long-term supplier agreements with hedging on key commodities, and holding business interruption insurance. Product quality and contamination risks are managed through rigorous due diligence, supplier audits, local technical support, crisis management training, communication strategies, and product liability and recall insurance. IT operational risks including cyber-attacks are addressed via enhanced IT security strategies, external assessments, 24/7 security operations, employee training, compliance audits, incident response plans, and cyber insurance. | Operational risks include supply chain disruptions due to reliance on third-party bottlers, canners, logistics, and limited suppliers for key ingredients like quinine and fresh green ginger. Commodity price volatility affects raw materials, packaging, and logistics costs. Product quality risks stem from the outsourced production model requiring consistent quality and safety, with potential for product liability claims or recalls impacting brand reputation. IT risks include cyber-attacks or system failures affecting operations, mitigated by a dedicated Technology Director, security strategies, 24/7 Security Operations Centre, employee training, compliance audits, and cyber insurance. The Group manages business continuity through diversified supply chain partners, buffer stocks, long-term supplier agreements, geographic manufacturing expansion, and insurance coverage. Loss of key executive personnel poses a risk to operations, mitigated by remuneration incentives and succession planning. Climate-related physical risks include extreme weather events and long-term climate shifts impacting ingredient availability and production, addressed by supplier diversification and stockholding. |
| Financial Risks | The Group is exposed to financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, pricing risk, market risk (interest rate and foreign exchange risk). Credit risk arises mainly from trade receivables; mitigated by dealing with creditworthy customers, credit insurance, and expected credit loss assessments. Liquidity risk is managed by active cash generation, maintaining substantial cash balances in multiple currencies, and access to equity funding if required. Pricing risk from input cost fluctuations is managed by agreeing long-term prices with suppliers and commodity hedging. Market risk includes interest rate risk, which is centrally managed but currently no debt or interest rate hedging is in place, and foreign exchange risk, managed by forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate currency exposure on forecast sales. Hedge effectiveness is regularly tested and any ineffectiveness recognized immediately. The Group holds derivative financial instruments with fair values approximating carrying values and manages financial liabilities prudently. | Financial risks encompass credit risk from trade receivables, mitigated by dealing with creditworthy customers, credit insurance, and expected credit loss assessments. Liquidity risk is managed through active cash management, substantial cash holdings in multiple currencies, and access to equity funding. Interest rate risk is minimal as the Group currently has no debt facilities and does not engage in interest rate hedging. Foreign exchange risk arises from currency mismatches in sales, purchases, receivables, and borrowings, managed via forward currency contracts and hedge accounting with ongoing effectiveness testing. Pricing risk relates to input cost inflation, managed through long-term supplier agreements and commodity hedging.

# Section 6: Future Outlook

## S6.1: Strategic Direction

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mergers and Acquisition | In January 2025, Fever-Tree announced a long-term strategic partnership with Molson Coors for exclusive sales, distribution, and production of the Fever-Tree brand in the US, marking a transformational step in the US market. Molson Coors acquired an 8.5% stake in Fever-Tree for £71.0 million and purchased the local trading entity Fevertree USA Inc for $23.9 million in cash. This partnership leverages Molson Coors' national distributor network and customer relationships to expand Fever-Tree's market presence and total addressable market in mixers and beyond. Following this, Fever-Tree initiated a share buyback programme of up to £71 million, extended by a further £29 million subject to shareholder approval, supported by the Group's strong balance sheet and improved cash flow prospects from the partnership. | The 2023 annual report does not mention any mergers and acquisitions strategy, acquisition targets, bolt-on deals, or strategic investments.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Fever-Tree faces significant economic challenges including ongoing input cost inflation driven by factors such as instability in Ukraine and the Middle East, which affects shipping routes, energy pricing, and availability. This leads to increased shipping costs, potential delays, and higher costs for key materials like glass bottles and CO2. The global inflationary pressures, cost of living crises (notably in the UK), and geopolitical uncertainties including numerous national elections in 2024 heighten risks of new or increased tariffs and local regulations, potentially impacting production costs and compliance requirements. Reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending, especially in mature markets where Fever-Tree is a market leader, may constrain demand and limit the company’s ability to raise prices to offset inflationary pressures. Supply chain risks include potential shortages of key ingredients due to poor harvests or climate change effects, which could disrupt production and sales. The Group also faces risks from currency fluctuations and interest rate changes, managed through hedging and financial policies. Additionally, climate-related physical risks such as heat waves, water scarcity, and flooding in sourcing regions (e.g., India, Mexico, Spain) pose medium to long-term threats to ingredient availability and operational continuity. Regulatory costs related to carbon pricing, extended producer responsibility, and sustainability reporting frameworks may increase operational expenses. Overall, these macroeconomic and geopolitical volatilities create uncertainties that could adversely affect revenue, margins, and profitability. | Fever-Tree faces significant economic challenges including global inflationary pressures, ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and political uncertainties such as the UK's exit from the EU. These factors contribute to macroeconomic volatility and heighten the risk of worsening economic conditions in key markets. Input cost inflation, particularly in raw materials like glass and energy, shipping disruptions, and increased logistics costs impact margins and profitability. Reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending in mature markets may limit the company's ability to raise prices to offset cost inflation. Supply chain risks include potential shortages of key ingredients due to climate change and poor harvests, as well as regulatory changes related to climate policies that could increase costs or require additional investments. The company also faces foreign exchange risks due to its operations in multiple currencies. Despite these challenges, Fever-Tree has taken steps such as long-term supplier agreements, hedging, expanding manufacturing footprint, and maintaining buffer stocks to mitigate these risks. The company remains cautious about ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility impacting revenue growth and cost base in the near term. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | Fever-Tree encounters competitive pressures from both established beverage companies and emerging local brands within the mixer category. In core markets like the UK, competitors employ aggressive pricing and marketing strategies aimed at capturing market share from Fever-Tree. Outside the UK, the company leverages its first-mover advantage to drive category growth and increase market share by building brand and category awareness and capitalizing on consumer trends such as premiumisation and mixed drinks. However, increased competition and unexpected competitor actions could lead to market share erosion, pricing pressures, and higher marketing expenditures, potentially impacting profitability and growth. Fever-Tree mitigates these risks through strong product quality, brand strength, diversified territorial and channel presence, ongoing investment in product innovation, and securing optimal sales and distribution partnerships. The company’s robust balance sheet and procurement scale provide resilience against macroeconomic challenges that may disproportionately affect smaller competitors. Despite these efforts, the competitive landscape remains dynamic and challenging, requiring continuous strategic focus to maintain and grow market position. | Fever-Tree continues to face strong competitive pressures from established beverage companies and new local or copycat brands in the mixer category. Competition is expected to intensify as rivals increase investment in existing brands, launch new products, or acquire local brands. In the UK, competitors employ aggressive pricing and marketing strategies aimed at gaining market share. Fever-Tree leverages its first mover advantage, product quality, brand strength, and diverse geographic and channel presence to mitigate these pressures. The company invests significantly in product innovation, sales force, and operational capabilities to defend and grow market share. Macroeconomic challenges disproportionately affect smaller competitors with weaker balance sheets, which may reduce competitive intensity. However, increased competition could still pressure pricing, marketing spend, and profitability, potentially hindering growth. Fever-Tree's outsourced operational model and strong brand positioning provide flexibility and barriers to entry, supporting its competitive resilience. |
