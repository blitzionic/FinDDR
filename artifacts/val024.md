# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 was 5.1%, increasing from £344.3m to £364.4m, followed by a slight increase of 1.1% to £368.5m in 2024. Gross margin showed a slight decline from 167.89% in 2023 to 162.44% in 2024, indicating increased cost pressures. Revenue by geographic region shows a shift, with the United Kingdom decreasing from £116.2m in 2022 to £111.1m in 2024, while the United States increased from £95.6m in 2022 to £128m in 2024, highlighting a growing market presence in the U.S. Europe saw a slight increase from £101m in 2022 to £105.4m in 2023 but then decreased to £97.2m in 2024. The Rest of the World segment showed a small increase from £31.5m in 2022 to £32.2m in 2024, indicating stable performance in that region. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 5.71% in 2023 to 8.90% in 2024, despite a decrease in operating income from £30.6m in 2022 to £20.8m in 2023, followed by a recovery to £32.8m in 2024. This suggests effective cost management strategies were implemented, as operating expenses increased from £88.2m in 2022 to £105.6m in 2024, but revenue growth outpaced expense growth.

There are no specific non-recurring items mentioned, but the increase in the tax rate could be attributed to changes in tax legislation or increased profitability.
