# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue increased from £344.3m to £364.4m, a growth of approximately 5.8%. From 2023 to 2024, revenue further increased slightly to £368.5m, a growth of about 1.1%. Overall, revenue shows a positive but decelerating growth trend. Gross profit decreased from £118.8m in 2022 to £117.0m in 2023, then increased significantly to £138.4m in 2024. However, the gross margin percentages reported (2024: 162.44%, 2023: 167.89%, 2022: 165.50%) appear inconsistent with typical definitions, suggesting possible data anomalies or alternative calculation methods. Cost of goods sold rose from £225.5m in 2022 to £247.4m in 2023, then decreased to £230.1m in 2024, indicating some cost control in 2024. Revenue by geographic region shows shifts: the United States revenue grew strongly from £95.6m in 2022 to £128.0m in 2024 (+33.9%), while the United Kingdom revenue declined from £116.2m to £111.1m (-4.4%). Europe revenue decreased slightly from £101.0m to £97.2m (-3.7%), and Rest of the World remained relatively stable. This suggests the US market is a key growth driver, while the UK and Europe markets are contracting or stable. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income declined from £30.6m in 2022 to £20.8m in 2023, then rebounded to £32.8m in 2024. Operating margin followed a similar pattern: 8.89% in 2022, dropping to 5.71% in 2023, then recovering to 8.90% in 2024. Operating expenses increased steadily from £88.2m in 2022 to £96.2m in 2023 and £105.6m in 2024, indicating rising costs. Despite rising operating expenses, the recovery in operating income and margin in 2024 suggests improved operational efficiency or higher revenue quality. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that the company managed to restore profitability after a dip in 2023, possibly through better cost management or operational improvements. However, the steady increase in operating expenses warrants attention for future cost control. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 19.68% in 2022 to 30.63% in 2023 and further to 31.27% in 2024. This rise in tax burden negatively impacted net profit margins, which declined from 7.23% in 2022 to 4.23% in 2023 before partially recovering to 6.62% in 2024. Net profit followed a similar trend, dropping from £24.9m in 2022 to £15.4m in 2023, then rising to £24.4m in 2024. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns, but the sharp tax rate increase suggests possible changes in tax regulations or adjustments. External factors such as geographic revenue shifts, especially the strong US growth, may have influenced tax exposure and profitability. Overall, external tax impacts have been a significant factor in profitability fluctuations over the period. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing modestly from £313.7m in 2023 to £321.9m. This growth was supported by increases in both current assets (£230.7m vs £225.8m) and non-current assets (£91.2m vs £87.9m). Total liabilities slightly decreased to £75.2m from £75.9m, driven by a reduction in non-current liabilities (£13.7m vs £15.1m) despite a small rise in current liabilities (£61.5m vs £60.8m). Shareholders' equity strengthened to £246.7m from £237.8m, reflecting retained earnings growth (£191.1m vs £183.1m). The current ratio improved marginally to 375.12%, indicating strong liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 30.48%, suggesting prudent liability management and a stable capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a healthy and slightly improved financial position with strong equity backing and controlled liabilities. | In 2023, the company maintained a stable overall financial position with total assets slightly increasing from £311.6m in 2022 to £313.7m. Non-current assets grew from £82.5m to £87.9m, indicating some investment in long-term assets. Current assets decreased marginally from £229.1m to £225.8m, while inventories increased from £60.1m to £67.6m, suggesting higher stock levels. Total liabilities rose from £72.4m to £75.9m, driven by an increase in current liabilities from £57.3m to £60.8m, with non-current liabilities stable at £15.1m. Shareholders' equity slightly declined from £239.2m to £237.8m, and retained earnings decreased from £184.8m to £183.1m, reflecting lower profitability. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, decreased from 399.83% to 371.38%, still indicating strong short-term liquidity but a downward trend. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly from 30.27% to 31.92%, showing a modest rise in leverage but still a conservative capital structure overall. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company’s profitability improved significantly in 2024. Revenue increased slightly to £368.5m from £364.4m in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased notably to £230.1m from £247.4m, resulting in a higher gross profit of £138.4m compared to £117.0m. Despite an increase in operating expenses to £105.6m from £96.2m, operating income rose substantially to £32.8m from £20.8m. Net profit increased to £24.4m from £15.4m, supported by higher income before taxes (£35.5m vs £22.2m). Margins improved with operating margin rising to 8.90% from 5.71% and net profit margin increasing to 6.62% from 4.23%. Return on equity and assets also showed marked improvement to 10.07% and 7.68% respectively, indicating enhanced earnings quality and sustainability. The effective tax rate remained stable around 31%. Overall, the company achieved stronger profitability and improved returns in 2024. | Revenue increased by 5.8% from £344.3m in 2022 to £364.4m in 2023, but gross profit slightly declined from £118.8m to £117.0m, reflecting increased cost of goods sold from £225.5m to £247.4m. Gross margin improved marginally from 165.50% to 167.89%, indicating some efficiency in production or pricing. Operating expenses rose significantly by 9.1% from £88.2m to £96.2m, causing operating income to fall sharply by 32% from £30.6m to £20.8m. Net profit declined by 38% from £24.9m to £15.4m, with net profit margin dropping from 7.23% to 4.23%. Return on equity and return on assets were reported for 2023 at 6.46% and 4.93% respectively, indicating moderate profitability and earnings sustainability but a deterioration compared to prior year metrics which were unavailable. The effective tax rate increased substantially from 19.68% to 30.63%, further pressuring net earnings. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2023 despite revenue growth. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed trends in 2024. The operating margin improved to 8.90% from 5.71%, reflecting better cost control relative to revenue despite higher absolute operating expenses. Asset turnover slightly declined to 115.95% from 116.55%, indicating a marginal decrease in asset utilization efficiency. Inventories were significantly reduced to £45.8m from £67.6m, which may have contributed to improved working capital management. Net cash from operations turned positive at £70.2m compared to a negative £3.8m in 2023, signaling a strong improvement in cash generation from core business activities. However, current liabilities increased slightly, which may require monitoring. Overall, the company enhanced its operational cash flow and cost control but should watch asset utilization trends. | Operating margin decreased from 8.89% in 2022 to 5.71% in 2023, reflecting higher operating expenses relative to revenue. Asset turnover was strong at 116.55% in 2023, indicating efficient use of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations turned negative, moving from £8.5m positive in 2022 to a £3.8m outflow in 2023, signaling operational cash flow challenges. Working capital management appears pressured as current assets decreased and inventories increased, potentially tying up cash in stock. The increase in inventories alongside declining operating cash flow suggests inefficiencies or slower inventory turnover. Overall, operational efficiency declined in terms of cost control and cash flow generation despite good asset utilization. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 suggest a low risk profile. Leverage remained moderate with a debt to equity ratio of 30.48%, slightly improved from 31.92% in 2023. Liquidity is strong, evidenced by a high current ratio of 375.12%. Interest expense remained stable at £0.6m, and interest coverage ratio improved significantly to 5466.67% from 3466.67%, indicating excellent ability to meet interest obligations. The effective tax rate was stable at 31.27%, showing no unusual tax risk. The reduction in non-current liabilities and stable current liabilities further reduce long-term financial risk. No early warning signs of liquidity or solvency issues are apparent from the data. | Leverage increased slightly with the debt to equity ratio rising from 30.27% to 31.92%, indicating a modest increase in financial risk. Interest expense increased from £0.4m to £0.6m, and interest coverage ratio decreased significantly from 7650% to 3466.67%, though still very high, indicating ample ability to cover interest costs. Liquidity remains strong but declined as current ratio fell from 399.83% to 371.38%. The effective tax rate rose sharply from 19.68% to 30.63%, which could indicate increased tax burden risk. Negative operating cash flow in 2023 is an early warning sign of potential liquidity stress if the trend continues. Overall, financial risk increased moderately but remains manageable at present. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities increased slightly with net cash used in investing rising to £10.8m from £7.6m, indicating ongoing capital expenditure or acquisitions to support growth. Net cash from operations improved substantially to £70.2m, supporting cash flow sustainability and the ability to fund dividends and investments. Dividends increased marginally to £19.6m from £19.1m, reflecting a stable dividend policy. Geographically, revenue growth was driven by the United States (£128.0m vs £117.0m) and Rest of the World (£32.2m vs £27.2m), while the United Kingdom and Europe saw declines, suggesting shifting market dynamics favoring international expansion. These trends imply potential for continued growth supported by strong operational cash flow and targeted investments, with a focus on expanding presence in higher-growth regions. | Investment activities showed a reduction in net cash used for investing from £10.0m outflow in 2022 to £7.6m in 2023, suggesting a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing improved significantly from a £70.7m outflow to £23.2m outflow, driven by a large reduction in dividends paid from £68.8m to £19.1m, indicating a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. The company’s revenue growth in the United States (from £95.6m to £117.0m) and Europe (from £101m to £105.4m) suggests geographic expansion or stronger market presence in these regions, while the UK and Rest of the World revenues declined slightly. The negative operating cash flow and reduced dividend payments imply a focus on cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company appears to be moderating investment and financing outflows while leveraging growth in key geographic markets, positioning for cautious but positive future financial performance. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces significant competition in the mixer category from other beverage companies, with intensified competition in core markets through aggressive pricing, marketing strategies, and brand introductions or acquisitions. Macroeconomic volatility including global inflation, cost of living crises, geopolitical conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East), and potential tariffs create risks of worsening economic conditions impacting demand and pricing power. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending may be adversely affected by these factors. The Group's first mover advantage, product quality, brand strength, and diverse market presence help mitigate these risks. The Group also monitors industry trends and consumer behavior to capitalize on premiumisation and long mixed drink trends. The Group expects to manage pricing pressures and maintain market share through investment in innovation, sales force, and supply chain partnerships. | The Group faces market risks including foreign exchange risk due to operations in the USA and Europe with transactions in USD and EUR, exposing it to currency fluctuations. The Group uses forward contracts to hedge currency risk but acknowledges incomplete protection. Competition is intense, especially in the mixer category, with risks from aggressive pricing and marketing by competitors, including multinationals and local brands. Macroeconomic volatility, including global inflation, geopolitical conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East), Brexit, and political uncertainty, heightens risks of worsening economic conditions in key markets, potentially impacting consumer demand and pricing power. The Group's first mover advantage, brand strength, product quality, and investment in innovation and sales force are key mitigants. Pricing risk arises from input cost inflation affecting profitability, managed by long-term supplier agreements and potential price increases to customers. Climate-related reputational and regulatory risks also pose market risks, with mitigation through ESG strategies and sustainable marketing claims. |
| Operational Risks | The Group operates an asset-light, outsourced business model relying on third-party bottlers, canners, logistics, and distribution partners, as well as key ingredient suppliers with limited sources (e.g., quinine, fresh green ginger). Disruptions in supply chain, production, storage, or distribution could impact revenue and cost of sales. Commodity price volatility and inflation in raw materials and logistics costs pose risks to operational costs. The Group mitigates these risks through multiple bottling partners across regions, buffer stocks of key ingredients and packaging materials, long-term supplier agreements, hedging of key commodities (natural gas, aluminium), and business interruption insurance. Product quality and contamination risks exist due to reliance on outsourced manufacturers and multiple suppliers; rigorous due diligence, supplier audits, local technical support, crisis management training, and product liability insurance are in place to mitigate these risks. IT system risks including cyber-attacks could materially affect operations and reputation; mitigations include enhanced IT security controls, external assessments, 24/7 security operations center, employee training, compliance audits, incident response plans, and cyber insurance. | Operational risks include supply chain disruptions due to reliance on third-party bottlers, canners, logistics, and limited key ingredient suppliers (e.g., quinine, green ginger). Disruptions or poor harvests could impact production continuity and costs. The Group maintains buffer stocks, diversified suppliers, multiple bottling partners, and geographic manufacturing footprint expansions to mitigate these risks. Product quality and contamination risks exist due to outsourced production and ingredient sourcing, with potential brand and financial impacts from product liability claims or recalls. The Group runs rigorous quality audits, due diligence, and local technical support teams. IT operational risks include cyber-attacks and system failures, which could materially affect operations. Mitigations include dedicated IT security teams, external assessments, 24/7 security operations, employee training, compliance audits, incident response plans, and cyber insurance. The Group also invests in crisis management training and simulation exercises. The loss of key executive management, including the founder, poses operational risk, with retention strategies including competitive remuneration and leadership development. |
| Financial Risks | The Group is exposed to financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, pricing risk, market risk (interest rate and foreign exchange risk). Credit risk arises mainly from trade receivables; the Group mitigates this by dealing only with creditworthy customers, continuous monitoring, credit insurance, and expected credit loss assessments. Liquidity risk is managed by active cash management, maintaining substantial cash balances in multiple currencies, and access to additional equity funding if required. Pricing risk from input cost fluctuations is managed by agreeing long-term prices with suppliers and commodity hedging agreements. Market risk includes interest rate risk, which is centrally managed with periodic reviews of hedging needs; currently, the Group has no debt facilities or interest rate hedging.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces significant economic challenges including ongoing input cost inflation across multiple categories which impacts margins and profitability. Geopolitical instability in Ukraine and the Middle East affects shipping routes, energy pricing and availability, leading to increased shipping costs, potential delays, and higher costs for key raw materials such as glass and CO2. The high number of national elections globally in 2024 raises risks of changes in foreign policy, including new or increased tariffs and local regulations, particularly impacting the UK-based production. Reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending, especially in mature markets, may depress demand and limit the Group's ability to raise prices to offset inflationary pressures. Supply chain risks include potential shortages of ingredients due to poor harvests or climate change effects, which could disrupt production. The Group also faces macroeconomic volatility from global inflationary pressures, cost of living crises, and political uncertainty. Additionally, commodity price volatility, foreign exchange fluctuations, and liquidity risks are managed but remain uncertainties. Climate-related physical risks such as heat waves, water scarcity, and flooding in sourcing regions (notably India and Mexico) pose medium to long-term risks to supply and costs. Transition risks related to carbon pricing, regulatory compliance, and evolving sustainability reporting frameworks may increase operational costs. The Group mitigates these risks through long-term supplier agreements, hedging, buffer stocks, and an outsourced business model providing operational flexibility. However, ongoing inflation and geopolitical volatility continue to pose challenges to revenue, cost base, and business continuity. | The Group faces significant economic challenges including global inflationary pressures, ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and political uncertainties such as the UK's exit from the EU. These factors heighten the risk of worsening economic conditions in key markets. Input cost inflation, particularly driven by elevated European energy costs impacting glass bottle costs and other raw materials, has pressured margins and profitability. Supply chain disruptions, including ingredient shortages due to climate change and conflicts affecting shipping routes (e.g., Suez Canal), increase costs and risk delays. Reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending in mature markets may limit the Group's ability to raise prices to offset inflationary pressures. The macroeconomic volatility and inflationary environment have led to increased working capital requirements and reduced operating cash flow conversion. Regulatory changes related to climate, packaging, and sustainability also pose potential cost and operational impacts. The Group mitigates these risks through long-term supplier agreements, hedging commodity prices, expanding manufacturing footprint, and maintaining buffer stocks, but economic uncertainties remain a key challenge going forward. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Group faces competitive pressures from established beverage companies and local brands in the mixer category, with intensified competition in core markets through aggressive pricing and marketing strategies aimed at gaining market share. Competitors may increase investment, introduce new brands, or acquire local brands, challenging the Group's market position. The UK market is particularly competitive with aggressive competitor tactics. Outside the UK, the Group leverages its first mover advantage to drive category growth and increase market share by building brand and category awareness and capitalizing on consumer trends towards premiumisation and mixed drinks. Increased competition could lead to declines in market share, pricing pressure, and higher marketing spend, adversely affecting profitability and growth potential. The Group counters these pressures through strong brand equity, product quality, diverse geographic and channel mix, significant investment in innovation, sales force, and supply chain partnerships. The Group's financial strength and scale provide resilience against competitors who may be more vulnerable to macroeconomic pressures. Despite these challenges, the Group has continued to grow market share while some competitors have lost share or reduced investment. | The Group continues to face strong competitive pressures from established beverage companies and local brands in the mixer category, with intensified competition expected as rivals increase investment, introduce new brands, or acquire local players. In the UK, competitors employ aggressive pricing and marketing strategies aimed at gaining market share. The Group leverages its first mover advantage, product quality, brand strength, and diverse geographic and channel presence to mitigate these pressures. Ongoing investment in product innovation, sales force, and operational capabilities supports defense against competitive threats. The challenging macroeconomic environment disproportionately affects smaller competitors lacking scale and procurement power, which the Group views as a competitive advantage. However, increased competition could still lead to market share erosion or pressure on pricing and marketing spend, potentially impacting profitability and growth potential. |

The company introduced Blood Orange Ginger Beer in the US to broaden its core mixer range, complementing its existing Ginger Beer offering. The cocktail mixer range aims to simplify making popular cocktails at home and enable On-Trade channels to offer high-quality cocktails previously limited to high-end bars. Fever-Tree also launched a range of sparkling mixers, including Pink Grapefruit and Lime & Yuzu, in European markets, targeting popular spirit pairings like vodka and tequila. The company extended its range to include Margarita and Bloody Mary cocktail mixers, targeting the large non-carbonated mixer category with no dominant national brand.
