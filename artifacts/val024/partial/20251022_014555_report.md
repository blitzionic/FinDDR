# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased from £344.3m to £368.5m, representing a compound growth of approximately 3.5% over two years, with a 5.8% increase from 2022 to 2023 and a modest 1.1% increase from 2023 to 2024. Gross profit rose from £118.8m in 2022 to £138.4m in 2024, but gross margin percentages slightly declined from 165.50% in 2022 to 162.44% in 2024, indicating a minor erosion in cost efficiency relative to revenue. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) fluctuated, increasing from £225.5m in 2022 to £247.4m in 2023 before decreasing to £230.1m in 2024, suggesting some volatility in direct costs. Geographic revenue distribution shows a shift: the United States revenue grew significantly from £95.6m in 2022 to £128.0m in 2024 (+33.9%), while the United Kingdom revenue declined from £116.2m to £111.1m (-4.4%). Europe saw a slight decrease from £101.0m to £97.2m (-3.7%), and Rest of the World increased marginally from £31.5m to £32.2m (+2.2%). This indicates a strategic or market-driven shift favoring the US region, partially offset by declines in the UK and Europe. Revenue by product/service data is unavailable, limiting detailed product-level insights. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin remained relatively stable from 2022 (8.89%) to 2024 (8.90%), with a dip in 2023 to 5.71%. Operating income increased from £30.6m in 2022 to £32.8m in 2024, despite a lower margin in 2023, reflecting improved operational performance in 2024. Operating expenses rose steadily from £88.2m in 2022 to £105.6m in 2024, an increase of 19.7%, outpacing revenue growth, which may indicate rising overhead or investment in operations. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that while revenue grew modestly, operating income growth was more volatile, suggesting fluctuating cost management effectiveness. The dip in operating margin in 2023 followed by recovery in 2024 suggests temporary operational challenges were addressed. Overall, cost management shows mixed effectiveness with rising operating expenses but eventual margin recovery. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 19.68% in 2022 to 31.27% in 2024, with a steady rise each year (30.63% in 2023). This increase in tax burden negatively impacted net profit margins, which declined from 7.23% in 2022 to 6.62% in 2024 despite higher operating income. Income tax expense rose from £6.1m in 2022 to £11.1m in 2024, nearly doubling, which contributed to net profit decreasing from £24.9m in 2022 to £24.4m in 2024, despite revenue growth. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are noted in the data. External factors such as increased tax rates appear to be the primary external influence on profitability, reducing net income gains from operational improvements. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing modestly from £313.7m in 2023 to £321.9m. This growth was supported by increases in both current assets (£225.8m to £230.7m) and non-current assets (£87.9m to £91.2m). Total liabilities slightly decreased from £75.9m to £75.2m, reflecting effective liability management, particularly a reduction in non-current liabilities from £15.1m to £13.7m, despite a small increase in current liabilities from £60.8m to £61.5m. Shareholders' equity strengthened from £237.8m to £246.7m, driven by retained earnings growth from £183.1m to £191.1m, indicating enhanced capital base and reinvestment of profits. Liquidity remained robust with the current ratio improving slightly from 371.38% to 375.12%, signaling strong short-term financial stability. The debt to equity ratio improved marginally from 31.92% to 30.48%, suggesting a conservative capital structure with manageable leverage levels. | In 2023, the company maintained a stable overall financial position with total assets slightly increasing from £311.6m in 2022 to £313.7m. Non-current assets grew by £5.4m, indicating some investment in long-term assets, while current assets decreased marginally by £3.3m. Total liabilities increased modestly from £72.4m to £75.9m, driven primarily by a rise in current liabilities from £57.3m to £60.8m, with non-current liabilities unchanged at £15.1m. Shareholders' equity slightly declined from £239.2m to £237.8m, reflecting the net profit decrease and dividend payments. The current ratio decreased from 399.83% to 371.38%, indicating a slight reduction in liquidity but still a strong short-term financial position. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly from 30.27% to 31.92%, showing a marginal increase in leverage but still a conservative capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a solid financial foundation with controlled liability growth and stable equity, though liquidity and equity have slightly softened compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company showed improved profitability in 2024 with revenue increasing slightly from £364.4m to £368.5m. Gross profit rose significantly from £117.0m to £138.4m, despite a reduction in cost of goods sold from £247.4m to £230.1m, indicating better cost control or product mix. Operating income increased substantially from £20.8m to £32.8m, although operating expenses rose from £96.2m to £105.6m, the operating margin improved from 5.71% to 8.90%. Net profit increased markedly from £15.4m to £24.4m, with net profit margin rising from 4.23% to 6.62%, reflecting enhanced earnings quality. Return on equity improved from 6.46% to 10.07%, and return on assets increased from 4.93% to 7.68%, both indicating more efficient use of equity and assets to generate profits. The effective tax rate remained stable around 31%, and interest expense was unchanged at £0.6m, supporting earnings sustainability. | Revenue increased by 5.8% from £344.3m in 2022 to £364.4m in 2023, demonstrating top-line growth. However, gross profit declined slightly from £118.8m to £117.0m despite higher revenue, due to a proportionally larger increase in cost of goods sold (up £21.9m). Gross margin improved marginally from 165.50% to 167.89%, suggesting some efficiency in production or pricing. Operating income fell significantly by 32% from £30.6m to £20.8m, driven by a £7.9m increase in operating expenses. Consequently, operating margin declined from 8.89% to 5.71%. Net profit dropped sharply by 38% from £24.9m to £15.4m, with net profit margin falling from 7.23% to 4.23%. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 6.46% and 4.93% respectively, indicating moderate profitability and earnings sustainability but a deterioration compared to prior year metrics which were unavailable. The effective tax rate increased substantially from 19.68% to 30.63%, negatively impacting net earnings. Overall, while revenue grew, profitability and earnings quality weakened in 2023 due to rising costs and higher tax burden. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by a higher operating margin of 8.90% compared to 5.71% in 2023, despite increased operating expenses. Asset turnover remained stable, slightly decreasing from 116.55% to 115.95%, indicating consistent revenue generation relative to asset base. Inventories decreased significantly from £67.6m to £45.8m, suggesting better inventory management or faster turnover. Net cash from operations turned positive and improved dramatically from a negative £3.8m in 2023 to a positive £70.2m in 2024, reflecting stronger cash generation from core business activities and improved working capital management. This positive cash flow contrasts with the prior year and supports operational sustainability. | Operating expenses increased by 9.1% from £88.2m to £96.2m, outpacing revenue growth and compressing operating margins. Asset turnover was strong at 116.55%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations turned negative, declining from £8.5m in 2022 to a cash outflow of £3.8m in 2023, signaling operational cash flow challenges despite reported profits. Inventories increased from £60.1m to £67.6m, which may indicate slower inventory turnover or stockpiling, potentially tying up working capital. The current ratio decreased but remained robust at 371.38%, reflecting good short-term liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: strong asset utilization but deteriorating cost control and negative operating cash flow, which could pressure working capital management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a stable and low-risk profile. Leverage, as measured by debt to equity, improved slightly to 30.48% from 31.92%, indicating reduced reliance on debt financing. Interest coverage ratio increased significantly from 3466.67% to 5466.67%, reflecting a very strong ability to meet interest obligations comfortably. Liquidity remained strong with a current ratio above 3.7, indicating ample current assets to cover current liabilities. The effective tax rate was stable at approximately 31%, with no significant tax risk changes. Interest expense remained constant at £0.6m, suggesting no increased financing cost risk. Overall, the company exhibits low financial risk with strong coverage and liquidity metrics. | Leverage increased slightly with debt to equity rising from 30.27% to 31.92%, indicating a modest increase in financial risk. Interest expense increased from £0.4m to £0.6m, but interest coverage ratio remained very high at 3466.67%, suggesting ample ability to service debt. The effective tax rate rose sharply from 19.68% to 30.63%, representing a tax risk that reduces net profitability. Liquidity remains strong with a current ratio above 3.7 times, though it declined from the prior year. Negative operating cash flow in 2023 is an early warning sign of potential liquidity stress if the trend continues. Dividend payments decreased significantly from £68.8m to £19.1m, possibly reflecting a more conservative cash distribution policy in response to cash flow constraints. Overall, financial risk is moderate with strong debt service capacity but emerging concerns from cash flow and tax expense increases. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company’s investment activities increased slightly with net cash used in investing rising from £7.6m to £10.8m, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions to support growth. Net cash from operations is robust at £70.2m, supporting cash flow sustainability and the ability to fund dividends and investments. Dividends increased marginally from £19.1m to £19.6m, reflecting a stable dividend policy. Geographic revenue trends show growth in the United States (£117.0m to £128.0m) and Rest of the World (£27.2m to £32.2m), while the United Kingdom and Europe saw declines, suggesting potential focus on expanding in the US and other international markets. These trends and strong cash flows position the company well for continued growth and shareholder returns. | Investment activities showed a reduced cash outflow from investing activities, improving from (£10.0m) in 2022 to (£7.6m) in 2023, indicating a potential moderation in capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing activities improved significantly from (£70.7m) to (£23.2m), driven by a substantial reduction in dividend payments from £68.8m to £19.1m, suggesting a shift toward preserving cash. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the United States region, which increased from £95.6m to £117.0m, while the United Kingdom and Rest of the World regions saw declines. Europe showed modest growth. This geographic revenue mix shift may indicate future growth opportunities in the US market. However, negative operating cash flow and declining profitability margins raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. The company appears to be adopting a more cautious dividend policy and controlling investment outflows, which may support financial stability but could limit growth acceleration. Overall, future performance depends on improving operational cash flow and leveraging growth in key geographic markets. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces significant competition in the mixer beverage category, with risks from aggressive pricing and marketing strategies by competitors in core markets such as the UK. There is a risk of declining market share and pressure on pricing and marketing spend. The Group also faces macroeconomic volatility risks including global inflationary pressures, cost of living crises, geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Ukraine and Middle East), potential tariffs, and political uncertainty, which could worsen economic conditions in key markets. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending may be impacted, affecting demand and pricing power. The Group mitigates these risks through its first mover advantage, product quality, brand strength, diverse territorial and channel mix, significant investment in product innovation, and strong balance sheet relative to competitors. The Group also expects to maintain or increase pricing to offset input cost inflation where appropriate. | The Group faces market risks including foreign exchange risk due to operations in the USA and Europe with transactions in USD and EUR, exposing it to currency fluctuations. The Group uses forward contracts to hedge currency risk but acknowledges it cannot fully eliminate exposure. Competition is intense in the mixer category, with risks from aggressive pricing and marketing by competitors, including multinationals and local brands. Macroeconomic volatility, including global inflation, geopolitical conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East), Brexit, and political uncertainty, heightens the risk of worsening economic conditions in key markets, potentially impacting demand and pricing power. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending may be affected by inflation and geopolitical instability, influencing product demand. The Group's first mover advantage, brand strength, product quality, and investment in innovation and marketing are key mitigants. Climate-related reputational and market risks arise from changing societal expectations on ESG performance and conscious consumerism, with mitigation through sustainable claims guidance and net zero roadmap development. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include supply chain disruptions due to reliance on third-party bottlers, canners, logistics, and limited suppliers for key ingredients such as quinine and fresh green ginger. Disruptions could impact production, storage, and distribution, affecting revenue and cost of sales. Quality risks arise from the outsourced production model requiring consistent high-quality product delivery; contamination or quality issues could damage brand reputation and lead to product recalls. The Group faces risks from IT system failures or cyber-attacks that could materially affect operations and reputation. Climate-related physical risks such as heat waves, crop failures, cyclones, water scarcity, and flooding could impact raw ingredient availability and production. The Group mitigates operational risks by maintaining multiple bottling partners across regions, buffer stocks of key ingredients and packaging, long-term supplier agreements with hedging on key commodities, rigorous supplier quality management and audits, IT security strategies including penetration testing, 24/7 security operations, employee training, and cyber insurance. Business interruption insurance is maintained to mitigate financial impacts of supply disruptions. | Operational risks include supply chain disruptions due to reliance on third-party bottlers, canners, logistics, and limited suppliers for key ingredients like quinine and fresh green ginger. Commodity price volatility and inflation in raw materials, packaging, and logistics can increase costs. Product quality risks stem from the outsourced production model and multiple ingredient suppliers, with potential for contamination or inconsistency impacting brand reputation and leading to product liability claims or recalls. IT operational risks include cyber-attacks and system failures affecting data processing and communications, with increased industry-wide cyber threats. The Group mitigates operational risks through rigorous quality audits, local technical support teams, crisis management training, insurance coverage, diversification of supply chain partners and geographic manufacturing footprint, buffer stocks of key ingredients and packaging, long-term supplier agreements with hedging on input commodities, IT security strategies including 24/7 Security Operations Centre, penetration testing, employee training, and cyber insurance. The Group also conducts crisis simulations and maintains business continuity and disaster recovery plans. |
| Financial Risks | The Group is exposed to financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, pricing risk, market risk (interest rate and foreign exchange risk). Credit risk arises mainly from trade receivables; the Group mitigates this by dealing only with creditworthy customers, monitoring exposures, requiring prepayment from non-creditworthy customers, and holding credit insurance. Liquidity risk is managed by active cash generation, maintaining substantial cash balances in multiple currencies, and access to additional equity funding if required.

# Section 6: Future Outlook

## S6.1: Strategic Direction

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mergers and Acquisition | In January 2025, Fever-Tree announced a long-term strategic partnership with Molson Coors for exclusive sales, distribution, and production of the Fever-Tree brand in the US. Molson Coors acquired an 8.5% stake in Fever-Tree for £71.0 million and purchased the local trading entity Fevertree USA Inc for $23.9 million in cash. This partnership aims to leverage Molson Coors' national distributor network and customer relationships to drive growth in the US market, Fever-Tree's largest and most dynamic market. The partnership is transformational, enabling expansion into new categories such as adult soft drinks and RTDs. Following this, Fever-Tree initiated a share buyback programme of up to £71 million, extended by a further £29 million subject to shareholder approval, supported by the Group's strong balance sheet and improved cash flow prospects. | The 2023 annual report does not mention any mergers and acquisitions strategy, acquisition targets, bolt-on deals, or strategic investments. There is no indication of plans to expand market share through acquisitions during the year. |
| New technologies | Fever-Tree continues to invest in technology and innovation, with intangible asset additions of £10.8 million in 2024, including £7.3 million related to a global operations technology programme and innovation projects. The Group's software investments focus on embedding technology across global operations to improve efficiencies, data quality, and business insights.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces significant economic challenges including ongoing input cost inflation across multiple categories which impacts margins and profitability. Geopolitical instability in Ukraine and the Middle East affects shipping routes, energy pricing and availability, leading to increased shipping costs, potential delays, and higher costs for key raw materials such as glass and CO2. The high number of national elections globally in 2024 raises risks of changes in foreign policy, including new or increased tariffs and local regulations, particularly impacting the UK-based production. Reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending, especially in mature markets, may depress demand and limit the Group's ability to raise prices to offset inflationary pressures. Supply chain risks include potential shortages of ingredients due to poor harvests or climate change effects, and regulatory or consumer perception shifts that could require additional investment. The Group also faces macroeconomic volatility from global inflationary pressures, cost of living crises, and political uncertainty. Additionally, commodity price volatility, foreign exchange fluctuations, and liquidity risks are managed but remain uncertainties. Climate-related physical risks such as heat waves, water scarcity, and flooding in sourcing regions (notably India and Mexico) pose medium to long-term risks to supply and costs. Transition risks related to carbon pricing, regulatory compliance, and evolving sustainability reporting frameworks may increase operational costs. The Group mitigates these risks through long-term supplier agreements, hedging, buffer stocks, and an outsourced business model providing operational flexibility. | The Group faces significant economic challenges including global inflationary pressures, ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and political uncertainties such as the UK's exit from the EU. These factors heighten the risk of worsening economic conditions in key markets. Input cost inflation, particularly driven by elevated European energy costs impacting glass bottle production and logistics, has pressured margins and profitability. Supply chain disruptions, including ingredient shortages due to climate change and conflicts affecting shipping routes (e.g., Suez Canal), further exacerbate cost pressures. Reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending in mature markets may limit the Group's ability to raise prices to offset inflationary impacts. The macroeconomic volatility has led to increased working capital requirements and reduced operating cash flow conversion. The Group also faces risks from regulatory changes related to climate policies, packaging regulations, and potential shifts in consumer behavior towards sustainability, which may increase costs or require additional investments. Despite these challenges, the Group is implementing mitigation strategies such as long-term supplier agreements, hedging commodity prices, expanding manufacturing footprint, and pricing actions to support margin recovery and sustain growth. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The Group faces competitive pressures from established beverage companies and local brands in the mixer category, with intensified competition expected in core markets through increased investment, brand launches, and acquisitions by competitors. In the UK, competitors employ aggressive pricing and marketing strategies aimed at gaining market share. Outside the UK, the Group leverages its first mover advantage to drive category growth and increase market share by building brand and category awareness and capitalizing on consumer trends towards premiumisation and mixed drinks. Increased competition could lead to market share decline or pressure on pricing and marketing spend, adversely affecting profitability and growth potential. The Group counters these pressures through strong brand equity, product quality, diverse territorial and channel mix, significant investment in innovation, sales force, and supply chain partnerships. The Group's financial strength allows it to sustain investment levels that smaller competitors may not, enabling it to maintain and grow market share despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. | The Group continues to face intense competitive pressures from established beverage companies and local brands in the mixer category, with competitors employing aggressive pricing and marketing strategies aimed at gaining market share, particularly in the UK. Competition may intensify as companies increase investment in existing brands, launch new brands, or acquire local players. The Group leverages its first mover advantage, product quality, brand strength, and diverse territorial and channel mix to mitigate these pressures. It invests significantly in product innovation, sales force, and operational capabilities to defend and grow market share. The challenging macroeconomic environment disproportionately affects smaller competitors lacking scale and financial strength, which the Group views as a competitive advantage. However, increased competition and unanticipated competitor actions could still adversely impact market share, pricing power, and profitability. The Group's outsourced operational model and strong brand positioning provide flexibility and barriers to competition, supporting its market-leading position. |

The company introduced a new Cocktail Mixer Range designed to simplify making popular cocktails at home and enable On-Trade channels to offer high-quality cocktails previously limited to high-end bars. The brand expanded into adjacent categories including adult soft drinks and cocktail mixers, achieving good distribution in the UK and positive launches in the US. The core mixer portfolio was broadened with products like Blood Orange Ginger Beer in the US, complementing existing Ginger Beer offerings. In Europe, new Sparkling mixers such as Pink Grapefruit and Lime & Yuzu were launched, targeting popular spirit pairings like vodka and tequila.
