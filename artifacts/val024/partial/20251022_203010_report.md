# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Fevertree Drinks Plc's revenue showed a steady increase from £344.3m in 2022 to £364.4m in 2023, and further to £368.5m in 2024, indicating consistent top-line growth. However, gross profit declined from £118.8m in 2022 to £117.0m in 2023 before rising to £138.4m in 2024. The gross margin percentages were unusually high and inconsistent with typical margins, reported as 165.50% in 2022, 167.89% in 2023, and slightly decreasing to 162.44% in 2024, suggesting possible data anomalies or unique accounting treatments. Revenue is overwhelmingly driven by carbonated products, constituting over 99% each year, with non-carbonated products contributing less than 1%. Geographically, the United States market showed strong growth from £95.6m in 2022 to £128.0m in 2024, while the United Kingdom and Europe experienced slight declines or fluctuations, and Rest of the World remained relatively stable around £30m, highlighting the US as a key growth driver. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from 5.71% in 2023 to 8.90% in 2024, recovering to near the 8.89% level seen in 2022, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency after a dip in 2023. Operating income rose from £20.8m in 2023 to £32.8m in 2024, aligning with revenue growth and better cost control. Operating expenses increased from £88.2m in 2022 to £105.6m in 2024, but at a slower rate than revenue, indicating effective cost management. The operating income to revenue ratio improved, signaling that the company managed to leverage its revenue growth into higher operating profits despite rising costs. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 19.68% in 2022 to 31.27% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profit margins, reducing net profit from £24.9m in 2022 to £24.4m in 2024 despite higher operating income. Net profit margin declined from 7.23% in 2022 to 6.62% in 2024, with a notable dip to 4.23% in 2023. There were no explicitly listed non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability in the provided data, suggesting that tax rate changes were the primary external influence on net profitability during this period. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | Fevertree Drinks Plc's total assets increased modestly from £313.7m in 2023 to £321.9m in 2024, driven by growth in both current assets (£230.7m vs £225.8m) and non-current assets (£91.2m vs £87.9m). Total liabilities slightly decreased to £75.2m from £75.9m, with a reduction in non-current liabilities (£13.7m vs £15.1m) offsetting a small rise in current liabilities (£61.5m vs £60.8m). Shareholders' equity improved to £246.7m from £237.8m, supported by increased retained earnings (£191.1m vs £183.1m). The current ratio remained strong and stable at approximately 375%, indicating excellent short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 30.48% from 31.92%, reflecting a conservative capital structure with low leverage. Overall, the company exhibits solid financial health with a strong equity base, stable liquidity, and manageable liabilities in 2024. | In 2023, Fevertree Drinks Plc's total assets slightly increased to £313.7m from £311.6m in 2022, indicating stable asset base growth. Current assets decreased marginally to £225.8m from £229.1m, while non-current assets rose to £87.9m from £82.5m, suggesting some investment in long-term assets. Total liabilities increased slightly to £75.9m from £72.4m, with current liabilities rising to £60.8m from £57.3m and non-current liabilities remaining flat at £15.1m. Shareholders' equity slightly decreased to £237.8m from £239.2m, reflecting the net profit decline and dividend payments. The current ratio decreased from 399.83% to 371.38%, still indicating strong liquidity but a slight reduction in short-term asset coverage of liabilities. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly to 31.92% from 30.27%, showing a modest increase in leverage but still a conservative capital structure. Overall, the company maintains a solid financial position with strong equity base and liquidity, though with slight pressure on working capital and increased leverage. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue grew marginally by 1.1% to £368.5m in 2024 from £364.4m in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased significantly to £230.1m from £247.4m, resulting in a substantial gross profit increase to £138.4m (+18.3%). Despite higher operating expenses (£105.6m vs £96.2m), operating income rose sharply by 57.7% to £32.8m, improving the operating margin to 8.90% from 5.71%. Net profit increased by 58.4% to £24.4m, lifting the net profit margin to 6.62% from 4.23%. Return on equity improved markedly to 10.07% from 6.46%, and return on assets increased to 7.68% from 4.93%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of capital. The effective tax rate was stable at around 31%. Overall, profitability strengthened significantly in 2024, driven by better cost control and margin expansion despite modest revenue growth. | Revenue increased by 5.8% to £364.4m in 2023 from £344.3m in 2022, showing top-line growth. However, gross profit declined slightly to £117.0m from £118.8m, despite a higher gross margin percentage (167.89% vs. 165.50%), indicating cost of goods sold rose disproportionately. Operating income fell significantly by 32% to £20.8m from £30.6m, with operating margin dropping from 8.89% to 5.71%, reflecting increased operating expenses (£96.2m vs. £88.2m). Net profit declined sharply by 38% to £15.4m from £24.9m, with net profit margin falling from 7.23% to 4.23%. The effective tax rate increased markedly to 30.63% from 19.68%, negatively impacting net earnings. Return on equity and assets for 2023 were 6.46% and 4.93% respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and asset base. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2023 due to rising costs, higher tax burden, and reduced profitability margins despite revenue growth. |
| Operational efficiency | Fevertree Drinks Plc demonstrated improved operational efficiency in 2024. The cost of goods sold reduction alongside stable revenue led to a higher gross profit. However, operating expenses increased by 9.8%, which partially offset margin gains but still resulted in improved operating income. Asset turnover remained stable at approximately 116%, indicating consistent asset utilization. Inventories decreased substantially to £45.8m from £67.6m, suggesting better inventory management. Net cash from operations turned positive and strong at £70.2m compared to a negative £3.8m in 2023, reflecting improved working capital management and cash generation. Despite increased investing outflows (£10.8m vs £7.6m) and stable financing outflows (£23.6m vs £23.2m), the company achieved a net increase in cash of £35.8m versus a decrease of £34.6m in the prior year. These factors collectively indicate enhanced operational efficiency and cash flow performance in 2024. | Operational efficiency showed mixed signals in 2023. Cost of goods sold increased to £247.4m from £225.5m, outpacing revenue growth, which compressed gross profit. Operating expenses rose to £96.2m from £88.2m, indicating less effective cost control. Asset turnover was high at 116.55%, suggesting strong utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories increased to £67.6m from £60.1m, which may indicate higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Net cash from operations turned negative to -£3.8m from a positive £8.5m in 2022, signaling operational cash flow challenges. Working capital pressure is evident with current assets decreasing and current liabilities increasing. Cash flow from investing activities was negative at -£7.6m compared to a positive £10.0m in 2022, reflecting increased investment outflows. Net cash from financing was negative at -£23.2m versus a large inflow of £70.7m in 2022, consistent with reduced dividend payments and possible debt repayments. Overall, operational efficiency declined with rising costs, negative operating cash flow, and increased inventory levels. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The company maintains low financial risk in 2024. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 30.48%, indicating low leverage. Interest expense remained minimal and stable at £0.6m, while interest coverage ratio increased significantly to 5466.67%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest obligations and negligible risk of default. The current ratio remained very high at 375.12%, signaling excellent liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations. The effective tax rate was stable at 31.27%, with no indication of tax-related risk changes. No significant increases in liabilities or adverse changes in capital structure were observed. Overall, Fevertree Drinks Plc exhibits a low-risk financial profile with strong liquidity, low leverage, and robust interest coverage in 2024. | Financial risk indicators show some emerging concerns in 2023. Leverage increased slightly with debt to equity rising to 31.92% from 30.27%, though still moderate. Interest expense increased to £0.6m from £0.4m, and interest coverage ratio decreased significantly to 3466.67% from 7650.00%, reflecting lower operating income but still very strong ability to cover interest. Liquidity remains strong but declined as current ratio fell to 371.38% from 399.83%. The effective tax rate rose sharply to 30.63% from 19.68%, increasing tax burden risk. Negative net cash from operations (-£3.8m) and declining cash balances (-£34.6m) raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments were sharply reduced to £19.1m from £68.8m, possibly to conserve cash. Inventory buildup and working capital tightening may pose operational liquidity risks. Overall, while leverage and interest risk remain low, cash flow weakness and higher tax rates present early warning signs. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity increased slightly with net cash used in investing rising to £10.8m from £7.6m, indicating ongoing capital expenditure or acquisitions to support future growth. The strong positive net cash from operations (£70.2m) and stable financing outflows (£23.6m) support cash flow sustainability. Dividends increased marginally to £19.5m from £19.1m, reflecting a consistent dividend policy and shareholder returns. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the United States market (£128.0m in 2024 vs £117.0m in 2023), while the UK and Europe saw declines, suggesting geographic shifts in demand. The product mix remained heavily weighted towards carbonated products (99.5%), indicating limited diversification. Given the strong cash flow generation, improving profitability, and targeted investment, the company is well-positioned for continued financial performance growth, particularly leveraging the expanding US market. | Looking ahead, Fevertree Drinks Plc's investment activity increased as indicated by negative net cash from investing (-£7.6m), suggesting ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. However, negative net cash from operations (-£3.8m) and reduced dividends (£19.1m vs. £68.8m) indicate cash flow pressures and a more conservative dividend policy, possibly to preserve liquidity. Revenue growth was driven by the United States (£117.0m, up from £95.6m) and Europe (£105.4m, up from £101.0m), while the UK and Rest of World regions declined slightly, signaling geographic shifts in market focus. The product mix remains heavily carbonated (99.2%), with a slight increase in non-carbonated products (0.8%), which may indicate product diversification efforts. Given the current financial pressures, future performance will depend on successful cost control, cash flow improvement, and leveraging growth in key geographic markets. The company appears to be investing for growth but must address operational cash flow and profitability challenges to sustain financial health. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces significant competition in the mixer category from other beverage companies, which may intensify through increased focus, investment, new brand introductions, or acquisitions. Aggressive pricing and marketing strategies by competitors, especially in the UK, pose risks to market share and profitability. Macroeconomic volatility including global inflation, cost of living crises, geopolitical conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East), and potential tariffs create risks of input cost inflation and reduced consumer confidence, impacting demand and margins. Consumer behavior shifts towards premiumisation and long mixed drinks are opportunities but also require continued brand and category awareness efforts. The Group mitigates these risks through its first mover advantage, product quality, brand strength, diverse territorial and channel mix, ongoing investment in innovation, and strategic partnerships such as with Molson Coors in the US. Pricing power and ability to increase prices in response to inflationary pressures are also key mitigants. | Fever-Tree faces market risks including intensified competition in core markets from other beverage companies increasing investment in existing or new brands, aggressive pricing and marketing strategies by competitors, and volatility in consumer demand influenced by macroeconomic factors such as global inflation, geopolitical conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East), Brexit, and political uncertainty. These factors may lead to input cost inflation, reduced consumer confidence, and pressure on pricing and profitability. The Group also faces reputational risks related to ESG and climate change perceptions, which could affect brand value and demand. Foreign exchange risk arises from operations in the USA and Europe with transactions in USD and EUR, managed through forward contracts and hedging strategies. Pricing risk from fluctuations in key input costs is managed by agreeing long-term prices with suppliers. The Group monitors market risks through a robust risk management framework and scenario planning. |
| Operational Risks | The Group operates an asset-light, outsourced business model relying on third-party bottlers, canners, logistics, and distribution partners, and depends on key raw materials like quinine and fresh green ginger from limited suppliers. Disruptions in supply chain, production, storage, or distribution could impact revenue and costs. Commodity price volatility affects raw materials, packaging, and logistics costs. Product quality risks arise from reliance on multiple outsourced manufacturers and suppliers; inconsistent quality or contamination could damage brand reputation and lead to recalls. The Group mitigates these risks by working with multiple bottling partners across regions, maintaining buffer stocks of key ingredients and packaging, long-term supplier agreements, commodity hedging, business interruption insurance, rigorous supplier quality management, audits, crisis management training, and product liability insurance. IT operational risks include cyber-attacks and system failures, mitigated by enhanced IT security strategies, 24/7 Security Operations Centre, employee training, compliance audits, and cyber insurance. Key management retention risk is addressed through competitive remuneration, LTIP incentives, succession planning, and culture preservation. Climate-related physical risks such as heat waves, water scarcity, and extreme weather events are managed through procurement diversification, business continuity planning, and climate risk scenario analysis. | Operational risks include supply chain disruptions due to reliance on third-party bottlers, canners, logistics, and limited suppliers for key ingredients like quinine and fresh green ginger. Disruptions could arise from geopolitical conflicts, climate change, inflationary pressures, or quality issues. Product quality and contamination risks could harm brand reputation and lead to product recalls. The Group mitigates these risks through rigorous supplier due diligence, quality audits, diversified manufacturing footprint across multiple regions, buffer stocks of key ingredients and packaging materials, long-term supplier agreements with hedging on commodity prices, and business interruption insurance. IT operational risks include cyber-attacks and system failures, mitigated by a dedicated Technology Director, security operations center, regular external assessments, employee training, and cyber insurance. The Group also faces risks related to loss of key executive personnel, with retention strategies including competitive remuneration and succession planning. |
| Financial Risks | The Group is exposed to financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, pricing risk, market risk (interest rate and foreign exchange risk). Credit risk arises mainly from trade receivables; mitigated by dealing with creditworthy customers, credit insurance, continuous monitoring, and expected credit loss provisions. Liquidity risk is managed by active cash management, maintaining substantial cash balances in multiple currencies, and access to equity funding if needed. Pricing risk from input cost fluctuations is managed through long-term supplier agreements and commodity hedging. Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions in USD and EUR; managed by forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges with ongoing effectiveness testing.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Fever-Tree faces significant economic challenges including global inflationary pressures, a cost of living crisis in the UK, ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and potential tariffs due to numerous national elections in 2024. These factors contribute to input cost inflation, particularly in raw materials like glass bottles and CO2, increased shipping costs, and energy pricing volatility. Such inflationary pressures impact margins and profitability. Reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending, especially in mature markets, may limit the Group's ability to raise prices to offset cost increases. Supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility remain risks, with the Group dependent on limited suppliers for key ingredients. The Group mitigates these risks through operational flexibility, contingency stockpiling, long-term supplier agreements, hedging of core commodities, and strategic partnerships such as with Molson Coors in the US. Despite these challenges, Fever-Tree expects to maintain its premium positioning and pricing power, though economic uncertainties and market conditions continue to pose risks to revenue and profitability. | Fever-Tree faces significant economic challenges including global inflationary pressures, ongoing geopolitical conflicts (notably in Ukraine and the Middle East), and political uncertainties such as the UK's exit from the EU. These factors contribute to input cost inflation across raw materials, packaging, energy, and logistics, impacting margins and profitability. Specific risks include increased shipping costs and delays, higher energy prices affecting glass manufacturing and CO2 availability, and potential disruptions to On-Trade outlets. Reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending in key markets may limit the Group's ability to raise prices to offset cost inflation. The Group also contends with macroeconomic volatility, foreign exchange risks, and elevated credit risk due to the current environment. Climate change poses medium to long-term risks through supply chain disruptions, ingredient availability, and regulatory changes that may increase costs or require reformulation. Inflationary pressures have led to increased inventory values and working capital requirements, reducing cash flow conversion. The Group mitigates these risks through operational flexibility, long-term supplier agreements, hedging, geographic diversification of manufacturing, and pricing strategies, but economic uncertainties remain a material challenge. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | Fever-Tree faces competitive pressures from established beverage companies and new entrants in the mixer category, particularly in core markets like the UK where competitors employ aggressive pricing and marketing strategies aimed at gaining market share. Increased competition could lead to declines in Fever-Tree's market share or pressure on pricing and marketing expenditures, adversely affecting profitability and growth potential. The Group leverages its first-mover advantage, product quality, brand strength, and diverse geographic and channel presence to mitigate these risks. Significant investment in product innovation, sales force, and supply chain partnerships supports its competitive position. The Group's strong balance sheet and scale provide resilience against smaller competitors who may struggle under current macroeconomic conditions. Fever-Tree continues to grow market share despite competitive challenges, supported by ongoing marketing and portfolio diversification efforts. | Fever-Tree faces competitive pressures from established beverage companies and local brands that may intensify through aggressive pricing, marketing strategies, and new product introductions. In core markets like the UK, competitors employ aggressive tactics to gain market share. Outside the UK, Fever-Tree leverages its first mover advantage to drive category growth and market share by building brand awareness and capitalizing on premiumisation trends. Increased competition could lead to market share erosion, pricing pressure, and higher marketing costs, adversely affecting profitability and growth potential. The Group counters these pressures through strong brand equity, product quality, innovation, diverse territorial and channel presence, and significant investment in sales and operational capabilities. The challenging macroeconomic environment disproportionately affects smaller competitors with weaker balance sheets, which may reduce competitive intensity. Nonetheless, ongoing innovation and strategic partnerships are critical to maintaining Fever-Tree's market-leading position amid evolving industry dynamics. |

| New product launches, emphasizing the company's commitment to continuously introducing differentiated products | In 2024, Fevertree Drinks Plc launched the Rosé Spritz in collaboration with Maison Mirabeau, blending Raspberry & Orange Blossom Soda with Mirabeau's Forever Summer Rosé wine to create a light, pale pink spritz with 8% ABV, targeting the growing spritz-style beverage trend. The product offers a refreshing, sophisticated choice for social occasions and mindful enjoyment, combining Fever-Tree's mixer expertise with artisanal winemaking. The company also expanded its portfolio with new cocktail mixers, including Margarita, Bloody Mary, and Espresso Martini mixers, tailored to local drinking trends, especially in the US market. Pink Grapefruit Soda saw approximately 50% sales growth in the UK, capitalizing on premium Tequila and Paloma serve popularity.
