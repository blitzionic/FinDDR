# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | BHP Group Limited's revenue declined from USD 65,098 million in 2022 to USD 53,817 million in 2023, then slightly increased to USD 55,658 million in 2024, indicating a partial recovery after a significant drop. Correspondingly, the gross margin decreased sharply from 50.27% in 2022 to 40.78% in 2023 and further to 33.97% in 2024, reflecting rising cost pressures or lower pricing power. Revenue by product shows a notable decline in Iron Ore from USD 30,767 million in 2022 to USD 27,952 million in 2024, and Coal revenue halved from USD 15,549 million in 2022 to USD 7,666 million in 2024, while Copper revenue increased moderately from USD 16,849 million in 2022 to USD 18,566 million in 2024. Geographically, China remains the dominant market but revenue there fell from USD 36,618 million in 2022 to USD 34,752 million in 2024, with other regions like Japan and India also showing declines, indicating potential regional demand softness or market shifts. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 52.39% in 2022 to 42.61% in 2023 and further to 31.51% in 2024, mirroring the gross margin trend and suggesting increased operating costs or reduced operational leverage. Operating income decreased from USD 34,106 million in 2022 to USD 22,932 million in 2023 and then to USD 17,537 million in 2024, while revenue also declined, but the sharper drop in operating income indicates margin compression. Operating expenses fluctuated, with a positive expense of USD 1,379 million in 2022, a lower USD 988 million in 2023, and an unusual negative expense of USD (1,371) million in 2024, which may reflect accounting adjustments or cost recoveries. Overall, cost management appears challenged as operating income and margins have deteriorated despite some expense reductions. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 32.40% in 2022 to 33.07% in 2023 and further to 40.17% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability. Income tax expense decreased from USD 10,737 million in 2022 to USD 7,077 million in 2023 and USD 6,447 million in 2024, consistent with lower pre-tax profits. Net profit margin dropped sharply from 47.47% in 2022 to 24.01% in 2023 and further to 14.19% in 2024, reflecting the combined effects of lower operating performance and higher tax rates. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, BHP Group Limited's total assets slightly increased to USD 102,362 million from USD 101,296 million in 2023, indicating stable asset base growth. Current assets rose to USD 24,338 million, supporting liquidity, while non-current assets remained nearly flat at USD 78,024 million. Total liabilities increased modestly to USD 53,242 million, driven by a notable rise in non-current liabilities to USD 38,946 million from USD 33,723 million, despite a decrease in current liabilities to USD 14,296 million. Shareholders' equity edged up slightly to USD 44,811 million, reflecting retained earnings growth to USD 39,963 million. The current ratio improved significantly to 170.24%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 118.81%, suggesting consistent leverage and capital structure. Overall, the company maintained a solid financial position with improved liquidity and stable capital structure in 2024. | In 2023, BHP Group Limited's total assets increased to USD 101,296 million from USD 95,166 million in 2022, driven primarily by a rise in non-current assets from USD 66,502 million to USD 77,945 million. Current assets decreased from USD 28,664 million to USD 23,351 million, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity resources. Total liabilities rose to USD 52,766 million from USD 46,400 million, with both current liabilities increasing to USD 19,043 million and non-current liabilities to USD 33,723 million. Shareholders' equity slightly declined to USD 44,496 million from USD 44,957 million, reflecting a marginal contraction in net worth. The current ratio decreased from 169.42% to 122.62%, signaling a reduction in short-term liquidity but still above 1, indicating the company can cover current liabilities with current assets. The debt to equity ratio increased from 103.21% to 118.59%, suggesting a higher leverage and greater reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Overall, the company shows growth in asset base but with increased leverage and somewhat reduced liquidity in 2023 compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | BHP Group's revenue increased modestly by 3.4% to USD 55,658 million in 2024 from USD 53,817 million in 2023. However, gross profit declined by 13.9% to USD 18,908 million due to a sharp rise in cost of goods sold to USD 36,750 million, up from USD 31,873 million. This led to a decrease in gross margin from 40.78% to 33.97%. Operating income fell by 23.6% to USD 17,537 million, with operating margin contracting from 42.61% to 31.51%. Net profit dropped significantly by 38.9% to USD 7,897 million, resulting in a net profit margin decline from 24.01% to 14.19%. Return on equity and return on assets also deteriorated markedly to 17.69% and 7.76%, respectively, from 28.89% and 13.15% in 2023, indicating reduced earnings quality and profitability. The effective tax rate increased substantially to 40.17% from 33.07%, further pressuring net earnings. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 with margin compression and lower returns despite revenue growth. | BHP Group's revenue declined significantly by 17.4% from USD 65,098 million in 2022 to USD 53,817 million in 2023. Gross profit dropped by 33% to USD 21,944 million, with gross margin contracting from 50.27% to 40.78%, indicating increased cost pressure or lower pricing power. Operating income decreased by 32.7% to USD 22,932 million, with operating margin falling from 52.39% to 42.61%. Net profit saw a sharper decline of 58.2% to USD 12,921 million, and net profit margin halved from 47.47% to 24.01%, reflecting lower profitability and possibly higher expenses or tax impacts. Income tax expense decreased but the effective tax rate slightly increased from 32.40% to 33.07%. Interest expense doubled to USD 997 million, impacting net earnings. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 28.89% and 13.15% respectively, indicating reasonable returns despite the profit decline. Overall, profitability weakened substantially in 2023 with margins compressing and net income falling sharply, though returns remain positive. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed signals in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased significantly, impacting gross profit negatively. Operating expenses were negative USD 1,371 million, which may indicate a reclassification or reversal of expenses, contrasting with USD 988 million in 2023, complicating direct comparison. Asset turnover remained stable at 54.66%, nearly unchanged from 54.79% in 2023, indicating consistent asset utilization. Net cash from operations improved to USD 20,665 million from USD 18,701 million, reflecting strong cash generation despite lower profitability. Inventories increased to USD 5,828 million from USD 5,220 million, which could suggest higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased and current assets increased, supporting liquidity. Overall, while cost pressures affected profitability, operational cash flow and asset utilization remained solid, indicating reasonable operational efficiency. | Cost of goods sold remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from USD 32,371 million to USD 31,873 million despite the revenue decline, contributing to margin compression. Operating expenses were reduced from USD 1,379 million to USD 988 million, showing some cost control efforts. Asset turnover was 54.79% in 2023, indicating moderate utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations declined sharply by 41.9% to USD 18,701 million, reflecting lower profitability and possibly working capital changes. Inventories increased slightly from USD 4,935 million to USD 5,220 million, which may indicate slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. The decrease in current assets and increase in current liabilities also suggest tighter working capital management or pressure. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: cost control on operating expenses but pressure on gross margins and cash generation, with asset utilization moderate but cash flow from operations significantly reduced. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators reveal some concerns in 2024. The debt to equity ratio remained high and stable at 118.81%, indicating significant leverage. Non-current liabilities increased notably, suggesting rising long-term debt or obligations. Interest expense rose to USD 1,467 million from USD 997 million, while interest coverage ratio declined sharply to 1195.43% from an exceptionally high 2300.10%, reflecting reduced but still strong ability to cover interest costs. The effective tax rate increased to 40.17%, which may impact net profitability and cash flows. The current ratio improved to 170.24%, indicating strong short-term liquidity and reduced liquidity risk. However, the decline in profitability and increased leverage could pose medium-term financial risks if trends continue. No other explicit risk factors are evident from the data. | Leverage increased as evidenced by the rise in debt to equity ratio from 103.21% to 118.59%, indicating higher financial risk. Interest expense doubled to USD 997 million, and although interest coverage remains very high at 2300.10%, it declined substantially from 6946.23% in 2022, signaling reduced buffer to cover interest costs. The current ratio decreased to 122.62%, still above 1 but showing reduced liquidity. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 33.07%, which could impact net profitability. The net cash from financing activities was negative USD 10,315 million, less than the prior year, indicating reduced financing inflows or increased repayments. The net decrease in cash of USD 4,679 million contrasts with a net increase in 2022, highlighting liquidity pressure. These factors combined suggest elevated financial risk in 2023, with increased leverage, higher interest costs, and reduced liquidity posing early warning signs. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity in 2024 decreased as net cash from investing was less negative at USD (8,762) million compared to USD (13,065) million in 2023, indicating reduced capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing was more negative at USD (11,669) million, reflecting higher outflows possibly due to debt repayments or dividends. Dividends paid decreased substantially to USD (7,675) million from USD (13,268) million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy aligned with lower earnings. Revenue growth was driven by increased sales in Copper (USD 18,566 million) and Iron Ore (USD 27,952 million), while Coal revenue declined to USD 7,666 million, indicating a shift in product mix. Geographically, China remained the largest market with increased revenue to USD 34,752 million, while Japan and South America revenues declined. The strong operational cash flow and improved liquidity position support cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company appears to be moderating investment and dividend payouts while focusing on core commodities and key markets, positioning for stable but cautious future financial performance. | Investment activity intensified in 2023 with net cash used in investing increasing to USD (13,065) million from USD (6,959) million, indicating higher capital expenditure or acquisitions which may support future growth. Dividend payments decreased to USD (13,268) million from USD (17,851) million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Cash flow from operations declined but remains positive at USD 18,701 million, supporting sustainability of operations and dividends. Revenue by product shows declines in key segments: Iron Ore revenue fell from USD 30,767 million to USD 24,812 million, and Coal from USD 15,549 million to USD 10,958 million, while Copper revenue was relatively stable. Geographically, revenue from China, the largest market, decreased from USD 36,618 million to USD 31,205 million, indicating potential market or demand challenges. The company’s increased investment and moderate cash flow generation suggest a focus on long-term growth despite near-term profitability pressures. Overall, future performance will depend on successful capital deployment and market recovery, with cautious dividend management reflecting prudent financial stewardship. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | BHP's primary business model is mining and selling commodities, specifically copper, iron ore, coal, nickel, and potash. The company generates revenue primarily through the extraction and sale of these commodities, including by-products such as uranium, gold, zinc, molybdenum, and silver. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods passes to the customer, typically upon delivery to a customer-specified destination. The business model includes mining operations segmented into Copper, Iron Ore, and Coal reportable segments, with additional operations such as Potash and Western Australia Nickel included in group and unallocated items. BHP also generates revenue from the sale of freight and fuel to third parties and provides some services, though these are not a significant proportion of total revenue. The company focuses on operational excellence, cost discipline, and continuous improvement through the BHP Operating System (BOS), which drives stable operating performance and safety. Capital allocation is disciplined via the Capital Allocation Framework (CAF), supporting growth and reliable operations. BHP pursues growth options in future-facing commodities aligned with global megatrends such as decarbonisation, electrification, urbanisation, and population growth. The company also engages in exploration, ventures, accelerators, and business development programs to replenish and enhance its resource base. Strategic partnerships, social value creation, and sustainability are integral to the business model, supporting long-term value creation and access to markets. Revenue for FY2024 was US$55.7 billion, with major contributions from iron ore (US$27.95 billion), copper (US$18.57 billion), and coal (US$7.67 billion). | The company operates primarily as a mining and resource extraction business, generating revenue through the production and sale of commodities including copper, iron ore, coal, nickel, uranium, and potash. Its business model involves development and mining of mineral resources, processing and refining ore, managing waste, and transporting products efficiently and sustainably to customers. Revenue is generated mainly from contracts with customers for the sale of these commodities, recognized when control passes to the customer, typically upon delivery. The company also provides some services, but these represent an insignificant portion of total revenue and are aggregated with product revenue. The company maximizes value through centralized marketing and procurement organizations, leveraging commercial expertise, market understanding, and strong customer and supplier relationships. Key products include copper (including by-products like silver, zinc, molybdenum, uranium, and gold), iron ore, metallurgical and energy coal, nickel, and potash. The company invests in operational excellence, technology, and capital allocation frameworks to drive productivity and growth, and pursues acquisitions and exploration to replenish and enhance its resource base. It also focuses on social value and sustainability as part of its value creation approach. |
| Market Position | BHP is a market leader in its key commodity markets, holding some of the largest, long-life, and lowest-cost assets globally. In iron ore, BHP's Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) operation is the world's lowest-cost major iron ore producer and achieved record production of 260 million tonnes in FY2024, with revenue of US$27.95 billion and an underlying EBITDA of US$18.9 billion. The iron ore segment delivered an underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) of 83% in FY2024, up from 67% in FY2023, indicating strong capital efficiency. In copper, BHP operates major assets including Escondida (the world's largest copper mine), Spence, Carrapateena, and Olympic Dam, with total copper revenue of US$18.57 billion in FY2024 and underlying EBITDA of US$8.56 billion. Copper South Australia is being developed into a significant copper province with production growth options beyond 500 ktpa. BHP is expanding its copper portfolio through acquisitions such as OZ Minerals and agreements to acquire interests in major copper projects like Filo del Sol and Josemaria. In coal, BHP focuses on steelmaking coal and energy coal, with FY2024 revenue of US$7.67 billion and underlying EBITDA of US$2.29 billion. The coal segment experienced a decline in production and profitability due to divestments and market conditions but remains a significant part of the portfolio. The company is repositioning its portfolio towards commodities aligned with global megatrends, including potash, where it is advancing the Jansen project to become a leading global player. BHP's competitive advantages include scale, operational excellence driven by BOS, a disciplined capital allocation framework, a strong balance sheet, and a commitment to social value and sustainability, which enhance its market position and resilience. The company maintains diversified global market access and strong customer relationships, supporting its leadership position despite geopolitical and market risks. | The company is a market leader with significant scale and competitive advantages in its key commodity markets. It holds the world's largest copper mineral resources on a contained metal basis and operates Escondida, the world's largest copper mine, which increased production by 5% in FY2023. It also has the second-largest nickel sulphide resources globally and operates Nickel West, one of the lowest GHG emission nickel operations.

BHP's partnerships with steelmaking customers to explore alternative steelmaking technologies, such as direct reduced iron production, aim to support the global energy transition and may lead to differentiated product offerings in the future. Overall, while no specific new products are named, BHP demonstrates a commitment to continuous product innovation and market differentiation through technology and sustainability-driven initiatives. | The 2023 annual report does not specifically detail new product launches by BHP Group Limited. However, it highlights ongoing innovation and technology deployment such as the rollout of autonomous haulage trucks at South Flank and Newman West, which have significantly improved safety and productivity. The Shiploader Automation Project is advancing with automation equipment installed on seven of eight shiploaders, expected to deliver safety, production, and cost improvements. BHP is also progressing studies on new leaching technologies at Escondida to extract more copper with lower water and energy consumption and to produce cathode-finished products that do not require smelting. Additionally, the Jansen Potash Project is under construction, expected to produce approximately 4.35 Mtpa of potash by late CY2026, with plans for a second stage to increase production further. Collaborative partnerships with steelmakers aim to develop low-carbon steelmaking solutions, but no specific new product releases are described. |
