# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from USD 65,098 million in 2022 to USD 53,817 million in 2023, a decrease of approximately 17.3%, followed by a slight recovery to USD 55,658 million in 2024, a 3.4% increase from 2023 but still 14.5% below 2022. Gross margin showed a significant downward trend, falling from 50.27% in 2022 to 40.78% in 2023 and further to 33.97% in 2024, indicating rising cost pressures or pricing challenges. Revenue by product/service reveals that Iron Ore remains the largest contributor but declined from £30,767m in 2022 to £24,812m in 2023 and slightly rebounded to £27,952m in 2024. Copper revenue decreased from £16,849m in 2022 to £16,027m in 2023 but increased to £18,566m in 2024, showing some recovery. Coal revenue sharply declined from £15,549m in 2022 to £10,958m in 2023 and further to £7,666m in 2024, indicating a significant contraction in this segment. Group and unallocated items fluctuated but remained relatively small. Geographically, China dominates revenue but declined from £36,618m in 2022 to £31,205m in 2023 before rising to £34,752m in 2024. Japan and India revenues have decreased notably over the period, with Japan dropping from £8,401m in 2022 to £4,557m in 2024 and India from £5,215m to £3,371m. Australia showed steady growth from £1,649m in 2022 to £2,393m in 2024. Europe and South America revenues declined steadily, while Rest of Asia and North America remained relatively stable. Overall, the company faces revenue contraction and margin compression, with some product and regional recoveries in 2024 but persistent challenges in coal and certain geographies. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined sharply from 52.39% in 2022 to 42.61% in 2023 and further to 31.51% in 2024, reflecting deteriorating operating efficiency. Operating income fell from USD 34,106 million in 2022 to USD 22,932 million in 2023 (a 32.7% drop) and further to USD 17,537 million in 2024 (a 23.5% drop from 2023). The operating income to revenue ratio mirrors the operating margin decline, indicating that costs grew faster than revenue or operational leverage weakened. Cost of goods sold increased from USD 32,371 million in 2022 to USD 31,873 million in 2023 and then to USD 36,750 million in 2024, despite revenue decreasing overall, which contributed to margin compression. This suggests cost management challenges, especially in 2024 where COGS rose by 15.3% from 2023 while revenue only increased by 3.4%. The decline in coal revenue and margins may have also impacted overall operating efficiency. The data indicates the company is facing operational headwinds, with reduced profitability and less effective cost control over the period. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from (32.40%) in 2022 to (33.07%) in 2023 and further to (40.17%) in 2024, indicating a rising tax burden that negatively impacts net profitability. Income tax expense decreased in absolute terms from (USD 10,737 million) in 2022 to (USD 7,077 million) in 2023 and (USD 6,447 million) in 2024, consistent with lower pre-tax profits. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring or one-off items in the data, suggesting the trends are driven by ongoing operational and market factors rather than unusual events. External factors likely affecting profitability include commodity price volatility impacting product revenues (notably coal and iron ore), and regional demand shifts, especially in China and Japan. The rising tax rate and declining margins collectively exert downward pressure on net profit, which fell from USD 22,400 million in 2022 to USD 14,324 million in 2023 and further to USD 9,601 million in 2024, reflecting the combined effect of operational challenges and increased tax impact. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a modest increase in total assets to 102,362 million USD from 101,296 million USD in 2023, indicating stable asset growth. Current assets increased from 23,351 million USD to 24,338 million USD, supporting improved liquidity, as reflected in the current ratio rising significantly from 122.62% to 170.24%. Non-current assets remained nearly flat, suggesting limited long-term asset expansion. Total liabilities increased slightly from 52,766 million USD to 53,242 million USD, with a notable shift from current liabilities decreasing from 19,043 million USD to 14,296 million USD, while non-current liabilities rose from 33,723 million USD to 38,946 million USD, indicating a restructuring of debt towards longer maturities. Shareholders' equity increased marginally from 48,530 million USD to 49,120 million USD, supported by a small rise in retained earnings from 39,787 million USD to 39,963 million USD. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 108%, reflecting consistent leverage. Overall, the balance sheet demonstrates solid financial health with improved liquidity, stable equity, and managed liabilities, though the increase in long-term debt warrants monitoring. | In 2023, the company demonstrated an overall increase in total assets to 101,296 million USD from 95,166 million USD in 2022, indicating asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from 66,502 million USD to 77,945 million USD. Current assets, however, declined from 28,664 million USD to 23,351 million USD, which may impact short-term liquidity. Total liabilities increased to 52,766 million USD from 46,400 million USD, with both current liabilities rising from 16,919 million USD to 19,043 million USD and non-current liabilities from 29,481 million USD to 33,723 million USD. Shareholders' equity slightly decreased to 48,530 million USD from 48,766 million USD, reflecting a relatively stable equity base despite increased liabilities. The current ratio decreased from 169.42% to 122.62%, indicating a reduction in liquidity but still above 1, suggesting the company can cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio increased from 95.15% to 108.73%, signaling higher leverage and a shift towards more debt financing. Overall, the balance sheet shows growth in asset base and liabilities with a stable equity position but a moderate decline in liquidity and increased leverage in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 3.4% from 53,817 million USD in 2023 to 55,658 million USD in 2024, showing moderate top-line growth. However, cost of goods sold rose disproportionately by 15.3% from 31,873 million USD to 36,750 million USD, causing gross margin to decline sharply from 40.78% to 33.97%. Operating income decreased by 23.5% from 22,932 million USD to 17,537 million USD, and net profit fell by 32.9% from 14,324 million USD to 9,601 million USD. Correspondingly, operating margin dropped from 42.61% to 31.51%, and net profit margin declined from 26.62% to 17.25%, indicating margin compression and reduced profitability. Return on equity and return on assets also declined significantly, from 29.44% to 19.66% and 14.58% to 9.43%, respectively, reflecting lower earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns. The effective tax rate increased from 33.07% to 40.17%, further pressuring net income. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 due to rising costs and tax burden despite revenue growth, signaling challenges in earnings sustainability. | Revenue declined significantly in 2023 to 53,817 million USD from 65,098 million USD in 2022, a decrease of approximately 17.4%. Cost of goods sold remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from 32,371 million USD to 31,873 million USD. This led to a notable decline in gross margin from 50.27% in 2022 to 40.78% in 2023, indicating margin compression. Operating income dropped sharply by about 32.7% to 22,932 million USD from 34,106 million USD, with operating margin decreasing from 52.39% to 42.61%. Net profit also declined by approximately 36% to 14,324 million USD from 22,400 million USD, with net profit margin falling from 34.41% to 26.62%. Return on equity was 29.44% and return on assets was 14.58% in 2023, indicating reasonable profitability and earnings sustainability despite the revenue and margin declines. The effective tax rate slightly increased from 32.40% to 33.07%. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with lower revenues and margins, but returns remain solid, reflecting earnings quality under pressure from reduced top-line performance. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating margin decreased notably from 42.61% in 2023 to 31.51% in 2024, indicating reduced cost control or increased operating expenses relative to revenue. Asset turnover remained nearly unchanged at approximately 54.7%, suggesting stable efficiency in using assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations improved by 10.6%, rising from 18,701 million USD to 20,665 million USD, which is a positive sign of cash generation despite lower profitability. Inventories increased from 5,220 million USD to 5,828 million USD, which may indicate higher stock levels potentially impacting working capital. Current liabilities decreased significantly, improving the current ratio and liquidity position. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: while cash flow from operations improved and asset utilization remained stable, margin compression and inventory growth suggest some operational challenges. | Operating margin decreased to 42.61% in 2023 from 52.39% in 2022, indicating reduced cost control or increased operating expenses relative to revenue. Asset turnover was reported at 54.79% in 2023, which suggests moderate efficiency in using assets to generate revenue, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations declined significantly to 18,701 million USD from 32,174 million USD in 2022, reflecting lower cash generation capacity. Working capital dynamics show a decrease in current assets and an increase in current liabilities, which may pressure operational liquidity. Inventories increased slightly from 4,935 million USD to 5,220 million USD, potentially indicating slower inventory turnover or stockpiling. Overall, operational efficiency declined in 2023 with lower operating margins and cash flow from operations, alongside mixed signals in asset utilization and working capital management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remained stable with a debt to equity ratio around 108%, but the composition shifted with current liabilities decreasing and non-current liabilities increasing, indicating a move towards longer-term debt obligations. Interest expense increased from 997 million USD to 1,467 million USD, and interest coverage ratio declined sharply from 2300.10% to 1195.43%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest costs comfortably, though still at a very high level. The effective tax rate increased from 33.07% to 40.17%, which could indicate higher tax risk or less favorable tax conditions. Liquidity improved significantly as shown by the current ratio rising to 170.24%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. Overall, financial risk is moderate with stable leverage but increased interest expense and tax rate pressures that require monitoring. | Leverage increased in 2023 as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio rising to 108.73% from 95.15% in 2022, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. Interest expense doubled to 997 million USD from 491 million USD, which, combined with a lower operating income, reduced interest coverage ratio substantially from 6946.23% to 2300.10%, though still very high, suggesting strong ability to cover interest despite increased costs. The current ratio declined to 122.62% from 169.42%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 33.07% from 32.40%, which may marginally impact net profitability. The increase in liabilities and interest expense, coupled with declining liquidity ratios, suggests elevated financial risk, though the company maintains strong interest coverage and equity base to mitigate immediate concerns. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a reduction in net cash used for investing from (13,065) million USD in 2023 to (8,762) million USD in 2024, suggesting a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow from (10,315) million USD to (11,669) million USD, with dividends paid decreasing substantially from (13,268) million USD to (7,675) million USD, indicating a more conservative dividend policy and potential retention of cash for future needs. Revenue by product shows growth in Copper and Iron Ore revenues but a decline in Coal revenue, signaling a possible shift in product mix or market demand. Geographically, revenue increased notably in China and Australia but declined in Europe, Japan, and South America, suggesting regional market dynamics that may influence future growth. The modest increase in net cash from operations and improved liquidity position support cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company appears to be moderating investment and dividend payouts while focusing on growth in key products and regions, positioning for cautious but stable future financial performance. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 with net cash used in investing increasing to (13,065) million USD from (6,959) million USD in 2022, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Net cash from financing activities improved to (10,315) million USD from (22,767) million USD, reflecting reduced outflows possibly due to lower dividend payments, which decreased to (13,268) million USD from (17,851) million USD. The net decrease in cash of (4,679) million USD contrasts with a net increase in 2022, suggesting tighter cash flow sustainability. Revenue by product shows declines in key segments such as Iron Ore and Coal, and geographic revenue decreased notably in major markets like China and India, indicating potential challenges in market demand or competitive pressures. The company’s increased investment and moderated dividend policy suggest a focus on long-term growth despite short-term revenue pressures. Overall, future performance may depend on successful deployment of investments and stabilization of market conditions in key regions. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | BHP's primary business model is mining and selling commodities, specifically copper, iron ore, coal, nickel, and potash. The company generates revenue primarily through the extraction and sale of these commodities to customers worldwide.
