| R&D investments, with a focus on advancing technology, improving products, and creating new solutions to cater to market trends | In FY2024, BHP Group Limited invested approximately US$30 million in research and development initiatives aimed at reducing GHG emissions in its value chain, particularly through partnerships and technology innovation. The company emphasized the use of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics, to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability. Notable R&D initiatives included the development of a digital tool at Escondida that generated an additional US$18.9 million in revenue by optimizing blasting patterns, and improvements to the Process Area Set Point Optimisation (PASPO) that increased steelmaking coal production revenue by US$15.5 million. | In FY2023, BHP Group Limited increased its resource assessment exploration expenditure by 42% to US$255 million, with greenfield exploration expenditure rising by 23% to US$95 million. The total metals exploration and assessment expenditure reached US$350 million. BHP Ventures, the company's dedicated venture capital unit, focuses on game-changing technologies and sustainable growth, supporting innovation primarily around decarbonisation. BHP Xplor, a global accelerator program, announced its first cohort of seven innovative mineral exploration companies, each receiving up to US$500,000 to support their development. Additionally, BHP invested US$122 million in operational GHG emission reductions and plans to allocate around US$4 billion for operational decarbonisation initiatives from FY2024 to FY2030. |
| New product launches, emphasizing the company's commitment to continuously introducing differentiated products | BHP's commitment to innovation is exemplified by the Jansen potash project, which is set to produce approximately 8.5 million tonnes per annum upon completion. The project is currently ahead of schedule, with Stage 1 expected to commence production in late CY2026. Additionally, BHP Ventures has invested in emerging technologies such as SiTration's silicon membrane for metal extraction and ZwitterCo's membrane solutions for water treatment, which are anticipated to contribute to the company's long-term growth and sustainability goals. | BHP's commitment to innovation is evident in its partnerships with major steel producers to develop low-carbon steelmaking technologies, with US$114 million committed to date. The company is also exploring electrolytic iron production through lab and pilot trials with its investment companies, Boston Metal and Electra. In FY2023, BHP's Nickel West operations increased production by 4% to 80 kilotonnes, driven by a higher proportion of concentrate and matte products. The company is also advancing the Jansen Potash Project, with Stage 1 expected to achieve first production by the end of CY2026, and has accelerated feasibility studies for Stage 2, which could begin production as early as FY2029. |
