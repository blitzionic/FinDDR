# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from USD 65,098 million in 2022 to USD 53,817 million in 2023, a decrease of approximately 17.3%, followed by a slight recovery to USD 55,658 million in 2024, a 3.4% increase from 2023 but still 14.5% below 2022. Gross margin deteriorated significantly from 50.27% in 2022 to 40.78% in 2023, with 2024 gross margin data unavailable, indicating potential cost pressures or pricing challenges. Revenue by product shows a shift: Copper revenue increased steadily from £16,849m in 2022 to £18,566m in 2024 (+10.2%), Iron Ore revenue declined from £30,767m in 2022 to £27,952m in 2024 (-9.2%), and Coal revenue sharply decreased from £15,549m in 2022 to £7,666m in 2024 (-50.7%). Group and unallocated items fluctuated but remained relatively small. Geographically, China remains the dominant market but revenue fell from £36,618m in 2022 to £34,752m in 2024 (-5.1%). Japan, India, South Korea, and Rest of Asia all saw declines, with Japan dropping from £8,401m to £4,557m (-45.8%). Australia showed growth from £1,649m to £2,393m (+45.1%), indicating a regional shift towards Australia. Europe and South America revenues declined moderately. Overall, the company faces revenue contraction with product mix shifting away from coal and iron ore towards copper, and geographic revenue shifting towards Australia despite declines in major Asian markets. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined markedly from 52.39% in 2022 to 42.61% in 2023 and further to 31.51% in 2024, reflecting deteriorating operating efficiency. Operating income fell from USD 34,106 million in 2022 to USD 22,932 million in 2023 (-32.7%) and further to USD 17,537 million in 2024 (-23.5% from 2023). The operating income to revenue ratio confirms this margin compression. Operating expenses decreased from USD 1,379 million in 2022 to USD 988 million in 2023, indicating some cost control, but 2024 operating expense data is unavailable. Despite some cost management, the sharper decline in operating income relative to revenue suggests rising costs of goods sold or other operational inefficiencies impacting profitability. The net profit margin also declined steeply from 47.47% in 2022 to 24.01% in 2023 and 14.19% in 2024, underscoring worsening bottom-line profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 32.40% in 2022 to 33.07% in 2023 and further to 40.17% in 2024, exerting additional pressure on net profitability. Income tax expense decreased in absolute terms from USD 10,737 million in 2022 to USD 7,077 million in 2023 and USD 6,447 million in 2024, consistent with lower pre-tax profits. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns, but the sharp declines in revenue, margins, and net profit suggest possible external factors such as market downturns or commodity price volatility impacting results. The significant drop in coal revenue and geographic shifts may reflect external market or regulatory changes. Overall, rising tax rates combined with external market challenges have negatively affected profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a modest increase in total assets to 102,362 million USD from 101,296 million USD in 2023, indicating stable asset growth. Current assets increased from 23,351 million USD to 24,338 million USD, supporting improved liquidity. Non-current assets remained nearly flat, suggesting limited long-term asset expansion. Total liabilities rose slightly to 53,242 million USD from 52,766 million USD, driven by a notable increase in non-current liabilities from 33,723 million USD to 38,946 million USD, while current liabilities decreased significantly from 19,043 million USD to 14,296 million USD. Shareholders' equity increased marginally to 44,811 million USD from 44,496 million USD, reflecting a stable equity base. The current ratio improved substantially from 122.62% to 170.24%, indicating stronger short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio remained almost unchanged at approximately 118.8%, showing consistent leverage levels. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a stable financial position with improved liquidity and controlled asset growth, though the rise in long-term liabilities warrants monitoring. | In 2023, the company showed an increase in total assets to 101,296 million USD from 95,166 million USD in 2022, indicating asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from 66,502 million USD to 77,945 million USD. However, current assets decreased from 28,664 million USD to 23,351 million USD, which may impact short-term liquidity. Total liabilities increased to 52,766 million USD from 46,400 million USD, with both current liabilities rising from 16,919 million USD to 19,043 million USD and non-current liabilities from 29,481 million USD to 33,723 million USD. Shareholders' equity slightly declined to 44,496 million USD from 44,957 million USD, reflecting a marginal weakening in equity position. The current ratio decreased from 169.42% to 122.62%, indicating reduced liquidity but still above 1, suggesting the company can cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio increased from 103.21% to 118.59%, showing higher leverage and a shift towards more debt financing. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth in asset base but with increased liabilities and slightly weakened equity, signaling moderate financial health with some pressure on liquidity and capital structure. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased moderately by about 3.4% to 55,658 million USD in 2024 from 53,817 million USD in 2023, indicating top-line growth. However, operating income declined significantly from 22,932 million USD to 17,537 million USD, and net profit dropped sharply from 12,921 million USD to 7,897 million USD, signaling margin compression and reduced profitability. Operating margin fell from 42.61% to 31.51%, and net profit margin declined from 24.01% to 14.19%, reflecting increased costs or lower operational efficiency. Return on equity decreased markedly from 28.89% to 17.69%, and return on assets dropped from 13.15% to 7.76%, indicating lower earnings quality and reduced returns on invested capital. The effective tax rate increased from 33.07% to 40.17%, further pressuring net profitability. Overall, despite revenue growth, profitability and earnings quality weakened considerably in 2024. | Revenue declined significantly by approximately 17.3% from 65,098 million USD in 2022 to 53,817 million USD in 2023. Gross profit dropped sharply from 32,727 million USD to 21,944 million USD, causing the gross margin to fall from 50.27% to 40.78%. Operating income decreased from 34,106 million USD to 22,932 million USD, with operating margin declining from 52.39% to 42.61%. Net profit was nearly halved, falling from 30,900 million USD to 12,921 million USD, and net profit margin dropped from 47.47% to 24.01%. Return on equity was 28.89% and return on assets 13.15% in 2023, indicating reasonable profitability relative to equity and assets despite the decline in absolute profits. The effective tax rate slightly increased from 32.40% to 33.07%. Overall, profitability and earnings quality worsened in 2023 with lower revenues and margins, but returns remain positive, suggesting earnings sustainability may be challenged but not critically impaired. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating margin declined to 31.51% in 2024 from 42.61% in 2023, indicating reduced cost control or higher operating expenses relative to revenue. Asset turnover remained stable at approximately 54.66%, nearly unchanged from 54.79% in 2023, suggesting consistent asset utilization. Net cash from operations increased to 20,665 million USD from 18,701 million USD, reflecting improved cash generation despite lower reported profits. Inventories increased slightly from 6,623 million USD to 7,039 million USD, which may indicate higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. The current ratio improvement to 170.24% supports better working capital management. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: cash flow from operations improved, but margins and cost control weakened. | Operating expenses decreased from 1,379 million USD to 988 million USD, reflecting some cost control efforts. However, the gross and operating margins declined, indicating that cost reductions did not fully offset revenue decreases. Asset turnover was 54.79% in 2023, a useful indicator of asset utilization though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations fell substantially from 32,174 million USD to 18,701 million USD, signaling reduced cash generation capacity. Inventories increased slightly from 6,250 million USD to 6,623 million USD, while working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) decreased from 11,745 million USD to 4,308 million USD, indicating tighter short-term operational liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency weakened in 2023 with lower cash flow generation and reduced working capital, despite some expense control. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remained stable with a debt to equity ratio of 118.81% in 2024, nearly unchanged from 118.59% in 2023, indicating consistent reliance on debt financing. However, interest expense increased from 997 million USD to 1,467 million USD, and interest coverage ratio declined sharply from 2300.10% to 1195.43%, suggesting increased interest burden though still at a comfortable coverage level. The effective tax rate rose significantly to 40.17% from 33.07%, increasing tax-related risk and reducing net income. Current liabilities decreased substantially, improving liquidity risk, as reflected in the higher current ratio. Overall, financial risk is moderate with stable leverage but increased interest and tax expenses warranting attention. | Leverage increased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio rising from 103.21% to 118.59%, indicating higher financial risk due to greater reliance on debt. Interest expense doubled from 491 million USD to 997 million USD, while interest coverage ratio decreased from an extremely high 6946.23% to 2300.10%, still very strong but showing a notable decline in the ability to cover interest costs. The current ratio dropped from 169.42% to 122.62%, reflecting reduced liquidity. The effective tax rate increased slightly, which could marginally impact net profitability. The combination of increased liabilities, higher interest expense, and reduced liquidity suggests elevated financial risk and early warning signs that require monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show reduced cash outflows from investing, with net cash from investing improving to (8,762) million USD from (13,065) million USD in 2023, indicating lower capital expenditure or asset purchases. Net cash from financing outflows increased to (11,669) million USD from (10,315) million USD, and dividends paid decreased significantly to (7,675) million USD from (13,268) million USD, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy and possible deleveraging or debt repayment focus. Revenue by product shows growth in Copper (from £16,027m to £18,566m) and Iron Ore (from £24,812m to £27,952m), but a decline in Coal revenue (from £10,958m to £7,666m), indicating shifting product demand or strategic focus. Geographically, revenue increased notably in China (from £31,205m to £34,752m) and Australia (from £1,702m to £2,393m), while Japan and South America saw declines, suggesting regional market dynamics affecting future growth. Overall, the company appears to be focusing on sustaining cash flow, moderating investments, and adjusting its product and geographic revenue mix to support future financial performance. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 with net cash used in investing increasing to (13,065) million USD from (6,959) million USD, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Net cash from financing activities improved to (10,315) million USD from (22,767) million USD, possibly reflecting reduced debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends paid decreased from (17,851) million USD to (13,268) million USD, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. Revenue by product shows declines in key segments such as Iron Ore (from £30,767m to £24,812m) and Coal (from £15,549m to £10,958m), while Copper revenue remained relatively stable. Geographically, revenue decreased notably in China (from £36,618m to £31,205m) and India (from £5,215m to £3,447m), indicating potential market challenges. Overall, the company is investing more heavily, managing cash flows prudently, and facing some market headwinds, which may constrain near-term growth but could support longer-term performance if investments yield returns. |
