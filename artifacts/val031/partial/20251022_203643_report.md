# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | BHP Group Limited's revenue declined from USD 65,098 million in 2022 to USD 53,817 million in 2023, then slightly increased to USD 55,658 million in 2024, indicating a partial recovery after a significant drop. The gross margin showed a sharp decline from 50.27% in 2022 to 40.78% in 2023, followed by an anomalous increase to 100.00% in 2024, which suggests a possible data inconsistency or extraordinary accounting adjustment in 2024. Revenue by product reveals that Iron Ore remains the largest contributor, though it decreased from USD 30,767 million in 2022 to USD 27,952 million in 2024. Copper revenue increased from USD 16,849 million in 2022 to USD 18,566 million in 2024, while Coal revenue significantly declined from USD 15,549 million in 2022 to USD 7,666 million in 2024. Geographically, China is the dominant market with revenue decreasing from USD 36,618 million in 2022 to USD 34,752 million in 2024, while other regions like Japan and South Korea also saw declines, reflecting possible regional demand shifts or market challenges. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined steadily from 52.39% in 2022 to 42.61% in 2023 and further to 31.51% in 2024, indicating decreasing operational profitability relative to revenue. Operating income dropped from USD 34,106 million in 2022 to USD 22,932 million in 2023 and then to USD 17,537 million in 2024, while operating expenses remained relatively stable around USD 32,371 million in 2022 and USD 36,750 million in 2024, suggesting rising costs or inefficiencies. The operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased, highlighting challenges in cost management despite revenue fluctuations. This trend points to increasing pressure on operational efficiency and the need for tighter cost controls or productivity improvements. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 32.40% in 2022 to 33.07% in 2023 and further to 40.17% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability. Correspondingly, net profit margin declined sharply from 47.47% in 2022 to 24.01% in 2023 and then to 14.19% in 2024, reflecting both higher tax burdens and operational challenges. Income tax expense decreased from USD 10,737 million in 2022 to USD 6,447 million in 2024, consistent with lower pre-tax profits. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided data, so the observed profitability changes appear primarily driven by operational performance and tax rate increases. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, BHP Group Limited's total assets slightly increased to USD 102,362 million from USD 101,296 million in 2023, indicating stable asset base growth. Current assets rose to USD 24,338 million, supporting liquidity, while non-current assets remained nearly flat at USD 78,024 million. Total liabilities increased marginally to USD 53,242 million, driven by a rise in non-current liabilities to USD 38,946 million, despite a decrease in current liabilities to USD 14,296 million. Shareholders' equity improved slightly to USD 49,120 million, reflecting retained earnings growth to USD 39,963 million. The current ratio improved significantly to 170.24% from 122.62%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 108%, suggesting a consistent capital structure with moderate leverage. Overall, the company maintained a solid financial position with improved liquidity and stable equity base in 2024. | In 2023, BHP Group Limited's total assets increased to USD 101,296 million from USD 95,166 million in 2022, driven primarily by a rise in non-current assets from USD 66,502 million to USD 77,945 million. Current assets decreased from USD 28,664 million to USD 23,351 million, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity resources. Total liabilities rose to USD 52,766 million from USD 46,400 million, with both current liabilities increasing to USD 19,043 million and non-current liabilities to USD 33,723 million. Shareholders' equity improved moderately to USD 48,530 million from USD 44,957 million, though retained earnings slightly declined to USD 39,787 million from USD 40,338 million. The current ratio decreased from 169.42% to 122.62%, reflecting a lower but still adequate liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly to 108.73% from 103.21%, indicating a marginally higher leverage but still balanced capital structure. Overall, the company shows growth in asset base and equity, with manageable increases in liabilities and a solid liquidity position despite some contraction in current assets. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased modestly by 3.4% to USD 55,658 million in 2024 from USD 53,817 million in 2023, driven by higher sales in copper and iron ore segments. However, cost of goods sold reported an unusual negative value of USD (1,371) million in 2024 compared to USD 31,873 million in 2023, which inflated gross profit to USD 54,287 million, resulting in a 100% gross margin—an anomaly that may reflect accounting adjustments or reclassifications. Operating expenses increased to USD 36,750 million, causing operating income to decline to USD 17,537 million from USD 22,932 million in 2023, and operating margin to fall to 31.51% from 42.61%. Net profit decreased to USD 7,897 million from USD 12,921 million, with net profit margin dropping to 14.19% from 24.01%. Return on equity and assets also declined to 16.17% and 7.76%, respectively, indicating reduced earnings quality and profitability despite revenue growth. The effective tax rate increased to 40.17% from 33.07%, further pressuring net income. | BHP Group's revenue declined significantly by 17.3% to USD 53,817 million in 2023 from USD 65,098 million in 2022. Correspondingly, gross profit dropped by 33% to USD 21,944 million, with gross margin contracting from 50.27% to 40.78%. Operating income fell by 32.7% to USD 22,932 million, and operating margin decreased from 52.39% to 42.61%. Net profit experienced a sharper decline of 58.2% to USD 12,921 million, with net profit margin halving from 47.47% to 24.01%. Income before taxes decreased by 35.4% to USD 21,401 million, and income tax expense reduced to USD 7,077 million, resulting in a slightly higher effective tax rate of 33.07% compared to 32.40% in 2022. Interest expense doubled to USD 997 million, impacting net profitability. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 stand at 27.64% and 13.15%, respectively, indicating reasonable profitability despite the downturn. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2023 with lower revenues and margins, increased interest costs, and reduced net profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency shows mixed signals in 2024. The asset turnover ratio remained stable at 54.66%, nearly unchanged from 54.79% in 2023, indicating consistent utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased to USD 20,665 million from USD 18,701 million, reflecting strong cash generation capability. Inventories rose to USD 5,828 million from USD 5,220 million, which may suggest higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Operating expenses increased by approximately 15%, which, combined with the unusual negative cost of goods sold, complicates cost control assessment. Net cash from investing activities decreased to USD 8,762 million from USD 13,065 million, indicating reduced investment outflows. Overall, the company maintained solid cash flow from operations but faced higher operating costs and increased inventory levels, suggesting potential areas for efficiency improvement. | Cost of goods sold remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from USD 32,371 million in 2022 to USD 31,873 million in 2023, indicating some cost control despite lower revenues. Operating expenses mirrored COGS at USD 31,873 million in 2023, down from USD 32,371 million. Asset turnover ratio is notably high at 54.79%, suggesting efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations declined sharply by 41.9% to USD 18,701 million, reflecting the impact of reduced profitability and revenue. Inventories decreased from USD 6,623 million to USD 5,220 million, indicating improved inventory management or lower stock levels. Working capital dynamics show a decrease in current assets and an increase in current liabilities, which may pressure short-term operational liquidity. Net cash from investing activities increased to USD 13,065 million from USD 6,959 million, indicating higher investment outflows. Cash flow from financing activities decreased to USD 10,315 million from USD 22,767 million, with dividends paid down to USD 13,268 million from USD 17,851 million, reflecting a more conservative cash distribution approach. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with strong asset turnover but reduced operational cash flow and increased investment activity. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators reveal some concerns in 2024. Although the debt to equity ratio remained stable at 108.39%, the increase in non-current liabilities to USD 38,946 million from USD 33,723 million signals rising long-term obligations. Interest expense increased to USD 1,467 million from USD 997 million, while interest coverage ratio declined sharply to 1195.43% from an exceptionally high 2300.10%, indicating reduced but still strong ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate rose significantly to 40.17%, which may impact net profitability and cash flows. The current ratio improved to 170.24%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. However, the unusual negative cost of goods sold and declining net profit margins may signal earnings quality risks. Overall, while leverage and liquidity remain manageable, rising interest costs and tax rates warrant monitoring. | Leverage increased slightly as indicated by the debt to equity ratio rising to 108.73% from 103.21%, signaling a modest increase in financial risk. The current ratio declined to 122.62% from 169.42%, suggesting reduced but still adequate short-term liquidity. Interest expense doubled to USD 997 million, which, while still low relative to operating income, caused the interest coverage ratio to fall significantly from 6946.23% to 2300.10%, indicating a reduction in the buffer to cover interest payments but remaining very strong. The effective tax rate increased marginally to 33.07% from 32.40%, which could slightly impact net profitability. The decline in net profit margin and cash from operations may signal early warning signs of profitability pressure. The reduction in revenue across key geographic regions such as China, India, South Korea, and South America, combined with increased liabilities, could pose operational and market risks. Overall, financial risk remains moderate with some early indicators of pressure on liquidity and profitability. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, BHP Group's investment activity appears to be moderating, with net cash from investing decreasing to USD 8,762 million from USD 13,065 million in 2023, possibly indicating a more cautious capital expenditure approach. Net cash from financing increased to USD 11,669 million from USD 10,315 million, while dividends paid dropped significantly to USD 7,675 million from USD 13,268 million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. Revenue growth in key segments like copper (USD 18,566 million) and iron ore (USD 27,952 million) continues, although coal revenue declined to USD 7,666 million, which may reflect shifting market dynamics or strategic focus. Geographically, China remains the largest market with increased revenue to USD 34,752 million, while Japan and South America revenues declined. The strong operational cash flow and improved liquidity position support sustainable dividend payments and potential future investments. However, rising tax rates and interest expenses may constrain profitability. Overall, the company appears positioned for stable financial performance with cautious investment and dividend strategies. | BHP Group's increased net cash used in investing activities to USD 13,065 million suggests ongoing or expanded capital expenditure, which may support future growth or asset base enhancement. The reduction in dividends to USD 13,268 million from USD 17,851 million indicates a more cautious dividend policy, potentially preserving cash for investment or debt management. Revenue declines in major product segments such as iron ore (down from USD 30,767 million to USD 24,812 million) and coal (down from USD 15,549 million to USD 10,958 million) may signal challenges ahead in these markets, while copper revenue remained relatively stable. Geographic revenue contraction in key markets like China (down from USD 36,618 million to USD 31,205 million) and India suggests potential regional demand softness. The strong asset turnover and maintained profitability ratios imply operational resilience. The company’s balance sheet growth and moderate leverage suggest capacity to sustain investment and operations. Overall, future performance will likely depend on market recovery in key commodities and regions, with current investment and cash flow strategies aimed at sustaining long-term financial health. |

| Financial Risks | Financial risks encompass market risk (interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity price risks), liquidity risk, credit risk, and capital structure exposures. Interest rate risk is managed via swaps converting fixed-rate debt to floating rates; a 1% increase in SOFR could reduce equity and profit by US$47 million. Currency risk arises from non-functional currency transactions and monetary items, managed through forward exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps to align exposures to US dollars. Commodity price risk is managed through market-based index pricing and derivatives. Credit risk from counterparties is mitigated by approved counterparty limits and monitoring. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining cash buffers, committed credit facilities, and diversified funding sources. Hedge accounting is applied to derivatives to manage fair value and cash flow risks. The Group's financial risk management is overseen by the Financial Risk Management Committee under CEO authority. | Financial risks comprise market risk (interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price), liquidity risk, credit risk, and capital structure risk. Interest rate risk arises from borrowings and cash deposits; managed via portfolio risk management strategy and use of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate exposure. Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions and balances in non-US dollar currencies; managed through forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to align exposures to US dollars. Commodity price risk is managed via derivatives and economic hedging aligned to index pricing. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining minimum cash and liquidity buffers, diversified funding sources, and committed credit facilities. Credit risk arises from customer receivables and financial counterparties; managed through credit approvals, counterparty limits, monitoring, and secured payment terms. The Group uses a Financial Risk Management Committee to oversee financial risk policies and hedging activities. The transition from LIBOR to SOFR has been actively managed with hedge accounting maintained. The Group monitors gearing and credit rating metrics under stress scenarios to protect financial security and flexibility. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks relate to regulatory and legal obligations including environmental laws, health and safety regulations, trade sanctions, anti-corruption laws, tax and royalty requirements, and evolving climate-related and sustainability reporting standards.
