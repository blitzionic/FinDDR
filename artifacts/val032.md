# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 saw a decline from £2,387m to £2,118m, representing a decrease of approximately 11.25%. However, there was a significant recovery in 2024, with revenue increasing to £2,863m, marking a growth of about 35.1% from 2023. The net profit margin improved from 7.62% in 2022 to 6.00% in 2023, and further to 8.21% in 2024, indicating enhanced profitability despite fluctuations in revenue. The revenue breakdown by product/service shows that wholesale electricity, net of hedging, surged from £685m in 2023 to £1,317m in 2024, while mass market electricity also increased from £937m to £1,018m. This suggests a strong recovery in core electricity sales. Other segments like C&I electricity - fixed price and gas also showed positive trends, indicating a diversified revenue stream. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses increased from £1,820m in 2022 to £1,613m in 2023, but rose significantly to £2,188m in 2024. This increase in operating expenses outpaced revenue growth in 2024, which could indicate potential inefficiencies or increased costs associated with scaling operations. The operating margin cannot be calculated due to missing data, but the net profit margin's increase suggests that despite rising costs, the company managed to maintain profitability through effective pricing or cost management strategies. The relationship between operating income and revenue remains unclear due to missing figures, but the overall trend indicates a need for improved cost management moving forward. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 28.06% in 2022 to 28.25% in 2023, and further to 30.47% in 2024. This rising tax burden could impact net profitability if not managed effectively. The income tax expense also rose from £71m in 2022 to £103m in 2024, reflecting the increased effective tax rate. There are no specific non-recurring items mentioned in the data, but the fluctuations in revenue and expenses suggest that external factors, possibly market conditions or regulatory changes, may have influenced profitability during this period. |

| Financial risk identification and early warning | In 2024, the debt to equity ratio increased to 137.04%, indicating higher financial leverage and potential risk exposure. The current ratio decreased to 70.95%, suggesting a decline in liquidity, which could impact the company's ability to meet short-term obligations. The effective tax rate rose to 30.47% from 28.25% in 2023, which may affect net profitability. Overall, the financial risk profile indicates increasing leverage and liquidity concerns that warrant close monitoring. | In 2023, the debt to equity ratio was 107.13%, reflecting a moderate level of financial leverage. The current ratio improved to 76.03%, indicating better liquidity compared to 2022. The effective tax rate was 28.25%, slightly higher than the previous year, which could impact net income. Overall, while the financial risk indicators were manageable, the increasing leverage trend suggests a need for careful debt management strategies. |
| Future financial performance projection | Based on the 2024 data, the company is positioned for continued revenue growth, with a significant increase in net cash from operations. However, rising operating expenses and liabilities may constrain profitability and equity growth. The focus on improving asset utilization and managing costs will be critical for sustaining cash flow and supporting future investments. The dividend policy remains stable, with dividends slightly increasing, indicating confidence in future earnings. | In 2023, the company faced challenges with declining revenue and profitability metrics. However, the improvement in cash flow from operations suggests potential for recovery. Future projections should focus on enhancing revenue generation strategies and managing costs effectively to improve margins. The stable dividend policy indicates a commitment to returning value to shareholders, but the company must ensure sustainable cash flow to support these distributions. |
