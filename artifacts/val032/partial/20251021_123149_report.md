# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue showed a mixed trend over the three years: it decreased from NZD 2387 million in 2022 to NZD 2118 million in 2023, a decline of approximately 11.3%, then rebounded strongly to NZD 2863 million in 2024, an increase of about 35.1% from 2023 and 19.9% above 2022. Gross margin data is unavailable, limiting direct assessment of cost of goods sold impact. Revenue by product/service reveals significant shifts: Wholesale electricity revenue dropped sharply from £1071m in 2022 to £685m in 2023 (-36.0%), then surged to £1317m in 2024 (+92.1% from 2023 and +23.0% from 2022). Mass market electricity revenue steadily increased from £869m in 2022 to £937m in 2023 (+7.8%) and further to £1018m in 2024 (+8.6%). C&I electricity fixed price revenue grew moderately from £215m in 2022 to £243m in 2023 (+13.0%) and £252m in 2024 (+3.7%). Other product lines such as gas, geothermal services, and telco showed gradual increases, while steam revenue declined notably from £35m in 2023 to £3m in 2024. Broadband revenue present in 2022 (£53m) was absent in later years, replaced by telco revenue. Geographic revenue data is not provided, preventing analysis of regional distribution or shifts. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expense increased from NZD 1820 million in 2022 to NZD 2188 million in 2024, with a dip to NZD 1613 million in 2023 before rising sharply in 2024 (+35.7% from 2023 and +20.3% from 2022). Operating income and margin data are unavailable, limiting direct margin trend analysis. However, net profit margin improved from 7.62% in 2022 to 8.21% in 2024 despite the expense increase, indicating improved overall profitability and possibly better cost management or higher revenue quality. The net profit rose from NZD 182 million in 2022 to NZD 235 million in 2024 (+29.1%), with a dip in 2023 to NZD 127 million (-30.2% from 2022). This suggests operational performance was challenged in 2023 but recovered strongly in 2024. The relationship between operating income and revenue cannot be precisely assessed due to missing data, but the net profit margin trend and revenue growth imply improved operating efficiency in 2024 compared to 2023. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 28.06% in 2022 to 30.47% in 2024, indicating a rising tax burden that could have slightly dampened net profitability gains. Income tax expense rose from NZD 71 million in 2022 to NZD 103 million in 2024, consistent with higher profits and tax rates. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data, limiting identification of one-off impacts. External factors affecting profitability cannot be directly assessed due to lack of geographic revenue and cost breakdowns or notes on market conditions. The tax rate increase and fluctuating net profit margins suggest some external fiscal or regulatory influences may have impacted profitability, but specifics are not provided. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows an overall stronger financial position with total assets increasing from NZD 5,808 million in 2023 to NZD 6,208 million, reflecting asset growth of approximately 6.9%. Both current assets and non-current assets grew, indicating ongoing investment and asset base expansion. However, total liabilities also increased from NZD 3,004 million to NZD 3,589 million, a rise of about 19.5%, outpacing asset growth. This led to a decrease in shareholders' equity from NZD 2,804 million to NZD 2,619 million, suggesting that liabilities grew faster than assets, weakening the equity base. The current ratio declined from 76.03% to 70.95%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased significantly from 107.13% to 137.04%, highlighting increased leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Retained earnings decreased marginally from NZD 813 million to NZD 773 million, which may reflect dividend payments exceeding net income additions. Overall, while asset growth is positive, the balance sheet shows increased leverage and a modest decline in equity strength and liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated asset growth with total assets increasing from NZD 5,166 million in 2022 to NZD 5,808 million, driven by increases in both current assets (from NZD 508 million to NZD 593 million) and non-current assets (from NZD 4,658 million to NZD 5,215 million). However, total liabilities grew more significantly from NZD 2,326 million to NZD 3,004 million, with current liabilities rising modestly and non-current liabilities increasing substantially. This led to a slight decrease in shareholders' equity from NZD 2,840 million to NZD 2,804 million and a reduction in retained earnings from NZD 959 million to NZD 813 million. The current ratio improved slightly from 72.88% to 76.03%, indicating a modest enhancement in liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased markedly from 81.90% to 107.13%, reflecting higher leverage and a shift towards greater reliance on debt financing. Overall, the balance sheet shows growth in asset base but with increased leverage and a slight contraction in equity, suggesting a more aggressive capital structure in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company experienced strong revenue growth in 2024, with revenue rising from NZD 2,118 million in 2023 to NZD 2,863 million, an increase of approximately 35%. Net profit nearly doubled from NZD 127 million to NZD 235 million, reflecting improved profitability. The net profit margin improved from 6.00% to 8.21%, indicating better earnings quality and operational leverage. Income before taxes increased from NZD 177 million to NZD 338 million, but the effective tax rate rose slightly from 28.25% to 30.47%, which somewhat offset pre-tax gains. Interest expense increased from NZD 76 million to NZD 105 million, but the company still managed to improve net profitability. Return on equity (ROE) nearly doubled from 4.50% to 8.67%, and return on assets (ROA) improved from 2.31% to 3.91%, both signaling enhanced earnings sustainability and efficient use of capital. Despite unavailable gross and operating margin data, the net margin and return ratios indicate a meaningful improvement in profitability and earnings quality in 2024. | Revenue declined by 11.3% from NZD 2,387 million in 2022 to NZD 2,118 million in 2023. Net profit decreased by 30.2% from NZD 182 million to NZD 127 million, and income before taxes fell from NZD 253 million to NZD 177 million. The net profit margin contracted from 7.62% to 6.00%, indicating reduced profitability relative to sales. Operating expenses decreased from NZD 1,820 million to NZD 1,613 million, but without gross profit data, margin analysis is limited. The effective tax rate remained stable at approximately 28%. Return on equity was 4.50% and return on assets was 2.31% in 2023, both relatively low, suggesting modest earnings quality and returns on invested capital. The increase in interest expense from NZD 36 million to NZD 76 million likely pressured net income. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with lower revenues and net income, compressed margins, and modest returns on equity and assets. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by an increase in asset turnover from 38.60% to 47.65%, showing better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses rose from NZD 1,613 million to NZD 2,188 million, reflecting higher costs likely associated with increased business scale, but the net profit margin improvement suggests cost control was effective relative to revenue growth. Net cash from operations increased significantly from NZD 395 million to NZD 580 million, indicating stronger cash generation capacity. Inventories decreased from NZD 48 million to NZD 37 million, which may reflect improved inventory management or changes in operational strategy. The current ratio decreased slightly, but working capital remains positive given current assets exceed current liabilities (652 million vs. 919 million). Overall, the company demonstrated improved asset utilization and stronger operational cash flow generation in 2024, supporting operational efficiency gains. | Operating expenses decreased by 11.3% in 2023, indicating some cost control efforts. However, without gross profit or operating income data, operating margin analysis is constrained. Asset turnover was reported at 38.60% in 2023, which suggests moderate efficiency in using assets to generate revenue, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations slightly declined from NZD 409 million to NZD 395 million, indicating stable but slightly reduced cash generation from core operations. Inventories decreased from NZD 58 million to NZD 48 million, which may reflect improved inventory management or lower demand. Working capital improved slightly as current assets grew faster than current liabilities. Overall, operational efficiency shows some positive signs in cost control and working capital management, but revenue decline and limited margin data restrict deeper conclusions. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show increased leverage and some liquidity pressure. The debt to equity ratio rose sharply from 107.13% to 137.04%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing and increased financial risk. The current ratio declined from 76.03% to 70.95%, suggesting a slight weakening in short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased from NZD 76 million to NZD 105 million, which, combined with higher debt levels, could pressure interest coverage, although specific interest coverage ratios are unavailable. The effective tax rate increased from 28.25% to 30.47%, which may impact net profitability. Retained earnings decreased slightly despite higher net income, possibly due to dividend payments, which could constrain internal funding. These factors collectively point to elevated financial risk in 2024, warranting close monitoring of leverage and liquidity positions. | Financial risk increased in 2023 as evidenced by a higher debt to equity ratio rising from 81.90% to 107.13%, indicating increased leverage and potential solvency risk. Interest expense more than doubled from NZD 36 million to NZD 76 million, which could strain earnings and cash flows. Interest coverage ratio data is unavailable, but the sharp rise in interest expense alongside declining income before taxes suggests reduced capacity to cover interest costs comfortably. The current ratio improved slightly to 76.03%, indicating adequate short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate remained stable, so no tax-related risk changes are noted. Overall, the company faces elevated financial risk due to increased leverage and interest burden, warranting close monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities remain significant with net cash from investing at negative NZD 595 million in 2024, slightly lower than the NZD 618 million outflow in 2023, indicating continued capital expenditure or acquisitions supporting growth. Net cash from financing decreased from NZD 195 million to NZD 104 million, suggesting reduced external financing or debt raising. Dividends increased slightly from NZD 243 million to NZD 248 million, reflecting a stable or slightly more aggressive dividend policy despite higher leverage. Revenue growth was broad-based across product lines, notably wholesale electricity revenue nearly doubled from £685 million to £1,317 million, and mass market electricity also increased, indicating strong market demand and growth potential. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. The strong operational cash flow and revenue growth, combined with ongoing investment, suggest positive future financial performance, though increased leverage and dividend commitments may constrain financial flexibility. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 as net cash from investing outflows increased from NZD (390) million to NZD (618) million, signaling higher capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Financing cash inflows of NZD 195 million in 2023, compared to unavailable data in 2022, suggest new debt or equity raised to support investments and operations. Dividends remained stable at approximately NZD (243) million, indicating a consistent dividend policy despite lower earnings. Net cash decreased by NZD 28 million in 2023, a reversal from a small increase in 2022, reflecting cash flow pressures. Revenue by product shows shifts with wholesale electricity revenue declining substantially while mass market electricity and telco revenues increased, indicating possible strategic shifts or market dynamics. Overall, the company appears to be investing for future growth with stable dividend payouts but faces cash flow challenges and evolving revenue mix that will impact future financial performance. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Contact is exposed to market risks including interest rate risk from fixed and floating rate debt, foreign exchange risk from commitments to pay suppliers and holders of US Private Placement and Australian medium-term notes, and commodity price risk related to electricity, natural gas, and carbon prices. The company faces volatility in wholesale electricity prices exacerbated by recent gas supply shortages and expects increased price volatility due to more intermittent electricity generation. External influences such as global economic conditions, climate change, and local factors like the cost of living and New Zealand's regulatory environment also impact market risks. Contact manages these risks through hedging strategies including interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, and derivatives for electricity price risk. The company monitors market risks continuously and integrates climate-related risks into strategic and operational risk assessments. The energy sector's challenges with energy security, affordability, and sustainability also present market risks. | Contact is exposed to market risks including interest rate risk from fixed and floating rate debt, foreign exchange risk from commitments to pay suppliers and US Private Placement note holders, and commodity price risk related to electricity, natural gas, and carbon prices.
