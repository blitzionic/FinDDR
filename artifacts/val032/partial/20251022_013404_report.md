# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue showed a mixed trend over the three years: it decreased from NZD 2387 million in 2022 to NZD 2118 million in 2023, a decline of approximately 11.3%, then rebounded strongly to NZD 2863 million in 2024, an increase of about 35.1% from 2023 and 19.9% above 2022. Gross margin data is unavailable, limiting direct assessment of cost of goods sold impact. Revenue by product/service reveals significant shifts: Wholesale electricity revenue dropped sharply from £1071m in 2022 to £685m in 2023 (-36.0%) but surged to £1317m in 2024 (+92.1% from 2023 and +23.0% from 2022), indicating volatility in this segment. Mass market electricity revenue steadily increased from £869m in 2022 to £937m in 2023 (+7.8%) and further to £1018m in 2024 (+8.6%), showing consistent growth. C&I electricity fixed price revenue rose moderately from £215m in 2022 to £243m in 2023 (+13.0%) and £252m in 2024 (+3.7%). Other segments such as gas, telco, and geothermal services showed modest growth or stability. Steam revenue declined notably from £35m in 2023 to £3m in 2024, indicating possible divestment or reduced demand. Geographic revenue data is not provided, so no analysis on regional distribution or shifts is possible. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses increased from NZD 1820 million in 2022 to NZD 2188 million in 2024, with a dip to NZD 1613 million in 2023 before rising sharply in 2024 (+35.7% from 2023 and +20.2% from 2022). Despite the lack of operating income and margin data, the net profit margin improved from 7.62% in 2022 to 8.21% in 2024, suggesting some operational leverage or improved cost management relative to revenue growth. The operating expense increase in 2024 outpaced revenue growth, which may indicate rising costs or investments impacting operating efficiency. The relationship between operating income and revenue cannot be precisely determined due to missing data, but the net profit increase from NZD 127 million in 2023 to NZD 235 million in 2024 (+85%) alongside revenue growth suggests improved profitability. Overall, operating efficiency appears mixed with rising expenses but stronger bottom-line results. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased slightly from 28.06% in 2022 to 30.47% in 2024, which would have a modest negative impact on net profitability. Income tax expense rose from NZD 71 million in 2022 to NZD 103 million in 2024, consistent with higher profits. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability cannot be directly assessed due to lack of qualitative information, but the volatility in wholesale electricity revenue and the sharp decline in steam revenue may reflect market or regulatory changes impacting segments differently. The tax rate increase and revenue volatility suggest external economic or policy influences on profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows an overall stronger financial position with total assets increasing from NZD 5,808 million in 2023 to NZD 6,208 million, reflecting asset growth of approximately 6.9%. Both current and non-current assets grew, with current assets rising from NZD 593 million to NZD 652 million and non-current assets from NZD 5,215 million to NZD 5,556 million. However, total liabilities also increased significantly by about 19.5%, from NZD 3,004 million to NZD 3,589 million, driven by rises in both current liabilities (from NZD 780 million to NZD 919 million) and non-current liabilities (from NZD 2,224 million to NZD 2,670 million). Shareholders' equity declined from NZD 2,804 million to NZD 2,619 million, indicating some erosion in net worth despite asset growth. The current ratio decreased from 76.03% to 70.95%, suggesting a slight weakening in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased markedly from 107.13% to 137.04%, indicating higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth in asset base but with increased reliance on debt financing and a modest decline in equity, signaling a need for careful liability management going forward. | In 2023, the company demonstrated asset growth with total assets increasing from NZD 5,166 million in 2022 to NZD 5,808 million, driven by increases in both current assets (from NZD 508 million to NZD 593 million) and non-current assets (from NZD 4,658 million to NZD 5,215 million). However, total liabilities grew more significantly from NZD 2,326 million to NZD 3,004 million, with both current liabilities rising from NZD 697 million to NZD 780 million and non-current liabilities from NZD 1,629 million to NZD 2,224 million. This liability growth outpaced equity, which slightly decreased from NZD 2,840 million to NZD 2,804 million, reflecting a modest erosion in shareholders' equity. Retained earnings also declined from NZD 959 million to NZD 813 million, indicating lower accumulated profits. Liquidity improved slightly as the current ratio increased from 72.88% to 76.03%, suggesting better short-term asset coverage of current liabilities. The capital structure shifted towards higher leverage, with the debt to equity ratio rising substantially from 81.90% to 107.13%, indicating increased reliance on debt financing. Overall, the company’s financial position shows growth in asset base but with increased leverage and a slight weakening in equity position, requiring careful monitoring of debt levels and equity preservation. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company experienced strong revenue growth in 2024, with revenue increasing by 35.1% from NZD 2,118 million in 2023 to NZD 2,863 million. Net profit nearly doubled, rising from NZD 127 million to NZD 235 million, improving net profit margin from 6.00% to 8.21%, indicating enhanced profitability and earnings quality. Income before taxes increased substantially from NZD 177 million to NZD 338 million, though the effective tax rate rose slightly from 28.25% to 30.47%, resulting in a higher income tax expense (NZD 103 million vs NZD 50 million). Interest expense remained stable at around NZD 40 million. Return on equity improved significantly from 4.50% to 8.67%, and return on assets increased from 2.31% to 3.91%, reflecting better utilization of equity and assets to generate earnings. Despite unavailable gross and operating margin data, the net margin and return ratios indicate improved earnings sustainability and profitability in 2024. | The company experienced a decline in revenue from NZD 2,387 million in 2022 to NZD 2,118 million in 2023, a reduction of approximately 11.3%. Correspondingly, net profit decreased from NZD 182 million to NZD 127 million, a 30.2% decline, reflecting pressure on earnings. Income before taxes also fell from NZD 253 million to NZD 177 million. The net profit margin contracted from 7.62% in 2022 to 6.00% in 2023, indicating reduced profitability relative to sales. Operating expenses decreased from NZD 1,820 million to NZD 1,613 million, which partially offset revenue decline but was insufficient to prevent profit erosion. The effective tax rate remained stable at around 28%, showing consistent tax burden. Return on equity was 4.50% and return on assets was 2.31% in 2023, both relatively low, suggesting modest earnings generation relative to invested capital and assets. The decline in retained earnings further signals challenges in earnings sustainability. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with lower revenues and net income, compressed margins, and modest returns, highlighting the need for improved revenue growth or cost management to enhance earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by an increase in asset turnover from 38.60% to 47.65%, showing more effective use of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses rose from NZD 1,613 million to NZD 2,188 million, a 35.7% increase, roughly in line with revenue growth, suggesting cost control was maintained relative to sales expansion. Net cash from operations increased significantly from NZD 395 million to NZD 580 million, indicating stronger cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased from NZD 48 million to NZD 37 million, which may reflect improved inventory management or changes in operational strategy. The current ratio decline to 70.95% suggests some pressure on working capital liquidity, but overall cash flow from operations growth supports operational robustness. | Operating expenses decreased by 11.3% from NZD 1,820 million in 2022 to NZD 1,613 million in 2023, indicating some cost control efforts. However, the absence of gross profit and operating income data limits margin analysis. The asset turnover ratio was reported at 38.60% in 2023, which provides a measure of revenue generated per unit of assets, but without prior year data, trend analysis is not possible. Net cash from operations slightly declined from NZD 409 million to NZD 395 million, a 3.4% decrease, reflecting somewhat stable but slightly reduced cash generation from core business activities. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities rose moderately, supporting liquidity. Inventories decreased from NZD 58 million to NZD 48 million, which may indicate improved inventory management or reduced stock levels. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with some cost reduction and stable cash flow, but revenue decline and limited margin data restrict comprehensive assessment. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators point to increased leverage and liquidity pressures in 2024. The debt to equity ratio rose sharply from 107.13% to 137.04%, indicating higher financial leverage and potential risk from increased debt burden. The current ratio decreased from 76.03% to 70.95%, signaling a slight deterioration in short-term liquidity. Interest expense remained stable at NZD 40 million despite higher liabilities, but interest coverage data is unavailable, limiting assessment of the company's ability to service debt from operating income. The effective tax rate increased modestly, which could impact net profitability. Overall, the company faces elevated financial risk due to increased leverage and reduced liquidity ratios, warranting close monitoring of debt servicing capacity and working capital management. | Financial risk increased in 2023 as evidenced by a higher debt to equity ratio rising from 81.90% to 107.13%, indicating greater leverage and potential vulnerability to interest and refinancing risks. Interest expense increased from NZD 36 million to NZD 41 million despite lower income before taxes, which may pressure interest coverage, though the exact interest coverage ratio is unavailable. The effective tax rate remained stable at approximately 28%, suggesting no significant tax risk changes. Liquidity improved slightly with the current ratio increasing to 76.03%, but the increase in current liabilities and overall debt levels warrants caution. The decline in retained earnings and net profit margin also signals potential earnings volatility. No data on interest coverage ratio or other risk metrics limits full risk assessment, but the leverage increase and rising interest expense highlight elevated financial risk in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities remain significant with net cash used in investing slightly reduced from NZD (618) million in 2023 to NZD (595) million in 2024, indicating continued capital expenditure or acquisitions supporting growth. Net cash from financing decreased from NZD 195 million to NZD 104 million, suggesting less reliance on external financing or repayment of debt. Dividends paid increased slightly from NZD (243) million to NZD (248) million, reflecting a stable or slightly more aggressive dividend policy despite higher leverage. Revenue growth was broad-based across product lines, notably wholesale electricity revenue nearly doubled from £685 million to £1,317 million, and mass market electricity increased from £937 million to £1,018 million, indicating strong market demand and expansion. Geographical revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. The strong operational cash flow and sustained investment imply positive future financial performance, but increased leverage and dividend commitments may constrain financial flexibility. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 as net cash from investing activities increased in outflow from NZD (390) million to NZD (618) million, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Financing cash inflows of NZD 195 million in 2023, compared to unavailable data in 2022, suggest new debt or equity financing to support investments and operations. Despite these investments, net cash decreased by NZD 28 million in 2023, reversing a small increase in 2022, which may pressure liquidity. Dividend payments remained stable at approximately NZD 243 million, reflecting a consistent dividend policy despite lower earnings. Revenue by product/service shows shifts with wholesale electricity revenue declining significantly from £1,071 million to £685 million, while mass market electricity and telco revenues increased, indicating possible strategic shifts or market dynamics. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. Overall, the company appears to be investing for future growth with increased capital expenditures and financing, maintaining dividends, but faces challenges in cash flow sustainability and revenue mix changes that require close monitoring. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Contact is exposed to market risks including interest rate risk from fixed and floating rate debt, foreign exchange risk from commitments to pay suppliers and note holders in foreign currencies, and commodity price risk related to electricity, natural gas, and carbon prices. The company faces volatility in wholesale electricity prices, influenced by factors such as weather, demand, fuel availability, competitor actions, and transmission system availability. External influences include global economic conditions, climate change, local cost of living, and New Zealand's regulatory environment. The company anticipates increased electricity price volatility due to more intermittent generation and recent gas supply shortages.
