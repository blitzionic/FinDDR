# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Contact Energy Limited's revenue showed a fluctuating trend with NZD 2,387 million in 2022, decreasing to NZD 2,118 million in 2023, then rising significantly to NZD 2,863 million in 2024. Gross margin data is not available for these years, limiting direct margin analysis. Revenue by product/service reveals that wholesale electricity, net of hedging, is the largest contributor, increasing from NZD 1,071 million in 2022 to NZD 1,317 million in 2024. Mass market electricity revenue also grew steadily from NZD 869 million in 2022 to NZD 1,018 million in 2024. Other segments such as C&I electricity fixed price and gas showed moderate growth, while electricity-related services and geothermal services remained relatively small contributors. Geographic revenue data is not provided, so regional analysis is not possible. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses increased from NZD 1,820 million in 2022 to NZD 2,188 million in 2024, with a dip to NZD 1,613 million in 2023. Operating income figures are not provided, preventing direct calculation of operating margin trends. However, net profit margin improved from 7.62% in 2022 to 8.21% in 2024 despite the rising operating expenses, indicating some operational leverage or improved cost management in other areas. The increase in operating expenses in 2024 outpaced revenue growth from 2023 to 2024, suggesting potential cost pressures. The 2023 dip in operating expenses alongside lower revenue may reflect cost control efforts during a revenue downturn. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 28.06% in 2022 to 30.47% in 2024, which likely exerted downward pressure on net profitability despite revenue growth. Income tax expense rose from NZD 71 million in 2022 to NZD 103 million in 2024, consistent with higher taxable income. No non-recurring items or explicit external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided data, limiting further analysis on one-off impacts or external influences. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Contact Energy Limited's total assets increased to NZD 6,208 million from NZD 5,808 million in 2023, reflecting asset growth primarily in non-current assets which rose from NZD 5,215 million to NZD 5,556 million. Current assets also increased modestly from NZD 593 million to NZD 652 million. Total liabilities grew significantly by 19.5% from NZD 3,004 million to NZD 3,589 million, with both current liabilities increasing from NZD 780 million to NZD 919 million and non-current liabilities from NZD 2,224 million to NZD 2,670 million. Shareholders' equity decreased from NZD 2,804 million to NZD 2,619 million, driven by a reduction in retained earnings from NZD 813 million to NZD 773 million. The current ratio declined from 76.03% to 70.95%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased markedly from 107.13% to 137.04%, signaling a higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company shows asset growth but with increased leverage and slightly weakened liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, Contact Energy Limited's total assets increased to NZD 5,808 million from NZD 5,166 million in 2022, reflecting asset growth primarily in non-current assets which rose from NZD 4,658 million to NZD 5,215 million. Current assets also increased modestly from NZD 508 million to NZD 593 million. Total liabilities grew significantly by 29.1% from NZD 2,326 million to NZD 3,004 million, driven by increases in both current liabilities (from NZD 697 million to NZD 780 million) and non-current liabilities (from NZD 1,629 million to NZD 2,224 million). Shareholders' equity slightly decreased from NZD 2,840 million to NZD 2,804 million, with retained earnings declining from NZD 959 million to NZD 813 million, indicating some pressure on equity despite asset growth. The current ratio improved slightly from 72.88% to 76.03%, suggesting a marginally better liquidity position. However, the debt to equity ratio increased markedly from 81.90% to 107.13%, indicating a higher leverage and a shift towards greater reliance on debt financing. Overall, the company shows asset growth and stable liquidity but increased financial leverage and a slight erosion in equity base in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Contact Energy Limited demonstrated strong profitability improvements in 2024. Revenue increased substantially by 35.1% from NZD 2,118 million in 2023 to NZD 2,863 million in 2024. Net profit nearly doubled from NZD 127 million to NZD 235 million, with income before taxes rising from NZD 177 million to NZD 338 million. The net profit margin improved from 6.00% to 8.21%, reflecting better earnings quality despite operating expenses increasing from NZD 1,613 million to NZD 2,188 million. The effective tax rate increased slightly from 28.25% to 30.47%, consistent with higher pre-tax income. Return on equity (ROE) nearly doubled from 4.50% to 8.67%, and return on assets (ROA) improved from 2.31% to 3.91%, indicating enhanced efficiency in generating profits from equity and assets. The asset turnover ratio increased from 38.60% to 47.65%, supporting the revenue growth. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved significantly in 2024. | Contact Energy's revenue declined by 11.3% from NZD 2,387 million in 2022 to NZD 2,118 million in 2023. Correspondingly, net profit decreased by 30.2% from NZD 182 million to NZD 127 million. Income before taxes also fell from NZD 253 million to NZD 177 million. The net profit margin contracted from 7.62% to 6.00%, reflecting reduced profitability relative to sales. Operating expenses decreased from NZD 1,820 million to NZD 1,613 million, indicating some cost control, but the absence of gross profit and operating income data limits margin analysis. The effective tax rate remained stable at approximately 28.25%, consistent with the prior year. Return on equity was 4.50% and return on assets was 2.31% in 2023, both indicating modest returns on invested capital. Interest expense more than doubled from NZD 36 million to NZD 76 million, which likely pressured net profit. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with lower revenues and net income, compressed margins, and increased interest costs impacting earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, Contact Energy Limited showed improved efficiency in 2024. Net cash from operations increased by 46.8% from NZD 395 million to NZD 580 million, indicating stronger cash generation from core business activities. Despite operating expenses rising by 35.7%, the company managed to increase revenue by 35.1%, maintaining operational leverage. Inventories decreased from NZD 48 million to NZD 37 million, suggesting better inventory management. Asset turnover improved from 38.60% to 47.65%, reflecting more effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from investing activities remained negative but slightly improved from NZD (618) million to NZD (595) million, indicating continued investment in assets. Net cash from financing activities decreased from NZD 195 million to NZD 104 million, while dividends paid increased slightly from NZD (243) million to NZD (248) million, showing a stable dividend policy. Overall, operational efficiency improved with stronger cash flow generation and better asset utilization. | Operating expenses decreased by 11.3% to NZD 1,613 million, suggesting improved cost control efforts. Asset turnover was reported at 38.60%, indicating the company generated NZD 0.386 in revenue per NZD 1 of assets, though without prior year data this cannot be compared. Net cash from operations slightly declined from NZD 409 million to NZD 395 million, showing relatively stable cash generation despite lower profits. Inventories decreased from NZD 58 million to NZD 48 million, which may reflect better inventory management or lower demand. Working capital improved slightly as current assets increased more than current liabilities, consistent with the improved current ratio. However, net cash from investing activities increased in outflow from NZD (390) million to NZD (618) million, indicating higher capital expenditures or investments. Overall, operational efficiency shows positive cost control and stable cash flow from operations, but increased investing outflows may pressure liquidity. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for 2024 highlight increased leverage and slightly reduced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio rose sharply from 107.13% to 137.04%, indicating higher financial risk due to increased reliance on debt financing. The current ratio declined from 76.03% to 70.95%, suggesting a modest decrease in short-term liquidity buffer. Interest expense increased from NZD 76 million to NZD 105 million, which may pressure interest coverage, although specific interest coverage ratios are unavailable. The effective tax rate increased from 28.25% to 30.47%, which could impact net profitability. No data on interest coverage ratio is provided, limiting assessment of debt servicing capacity. Overall, the company faces elevated financial risk due to higher leverage and interest costs, warranting close monitoring. | The company’s leverage increased notably in 2023, with the debt to equity ratio rising from 81.90% to 107.13%, signaling higher financial risk due to greater reliance on debt. Interest expense more than doubled to NZD 76 million, which could strain interest coverage, though this metric is unavailable. The current ratio improved slightly to 76.03%, indicating adequate short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate remained stable, so no tax-related risk changes are evident. The increase in non-current liabilities from NZD 1,629 million to NZD 2,224 million suggests more long-term debt or obligations. The net cash from financing activities was positive at NZD 195 million, possibly reflecting new borrowings. The net decrease in cash of NZD 28 million despite positive operating cash flow and financing inflows may indicate liquidity pressures. Overall, the company faces elevated financial risk from increased leverage and interest costs, warranting monitoring of debt servicing capacity. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Contact Energy Limited's sustained investment activity is evident from continued negative net cash from investing at NZD (595) million, slightly lower than the prior year, indicating ongoing capital expenditure likely to support future growth. Strong net cash from operations at NZD 580 million and stable dividend payments of NZD (248) million suggest cash flow sustainability and a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue growth across key segments such as wholesale electricity (increasing from NZD 685 million to NZD 1,317 million) and mass market electricity (from NZD 937 million to NZD 1,018 million) indicates positive segment performance and potential for continued expansion. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional outlook. The increased leverage may support growth initiatives but also raises financial risk. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued growth with solid cash flow and investment, balanced by the need to manage increased financial risk. | Contact Energy’s increased net cash outflow from investing activities (NZD (618) million) compared to the prior year (NZD (390) million) suggests heightened investment activity, potentially in asset growth or modernization, which may support future revenue streams. The positive net cash from financing of NZD 195 million indicates new capital raising or debt issuance to fund these investments. Dividends remained stable at NZD (243) million, reflecting a consistent dividend policy despite lower profits, which may pressure retained earnings and equity. Revenue by product shows growth in mass market electricity (NZD 937 million vs. 869 million in 2022) and fixed price C&I electricity (NZD 243 million vs. 215 million), but a decline in wholesale electricity revenue (NZD 685 million vs. 1,071 million), indicating shifts in revenue mix that could affect future earnings stability. The increase in telco revenue (NZD 66 million vs. 53 million) and geothermal services (NZD 6 million vs. 3 million) may signal diversification. Overall, the company is investing heavily with stable dividend payouts and evolving revenue streams, suggesting a focus on growth and diversification but with potential cash flow sustainability challenges if profitability does not improve. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Contact Energy Limited faces market risks including exposure to interest rate fluctuations on fixed and floating rate debt, foreign exchange rate movements related to supplier payments and foreign currency notes, and commodity price volatility in electricity, natural gas, and carbon prices. The company manages these risks through financial instruments such as interest rate swaps (IRS), cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS), forward foreign exchange contracts, and derivatives to hedge electricity price exposure. The integrated Wholesale and Retail businesses provide a natural hedge for electricity price risk. Additionally, external factors such as global economic conditions, climate change, New Zealand's regulatory environment, and increasing electricity price volatility due to intermittent renewable generation and gas supply shortages impact market risk. Contact also monitors wholesale electricity prices and discount rates as key sensitivities affecting valuation. The company actively engages with stakeholders and the Board to monitor and respond to these market risks. | Contact Energy Limited faces market risks including interest rate risk from fixed and floating rate debt, managed through interest rate swaps (IRS) and cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) to balance fixed and floating exposures. Foreign exchange risk arises from commitments to pay suppliers and US Private Placement note holders, mitigated by forward foreign exchange contracts and CCIRS to fix NZD cash flows. Commodity price risk includes exposure to wholesale electricity prices, natural gas prices, and carbon prices. The integrated Wholesale and Retail businesses provide a natural hedge for electricity price risk, with derivatives used to fix residual exposure. Gas price risk is managed through short- and long-term gas purchase contracts, and carbon price risk is managed via spot and forward purchases and auction participation. Market risks are monitored through policies and risk management frameworks, including sensitivity analyses on electricity prices and interest rates. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include challenges in business operations such as generation asset reliability and resilience, supply chain risks, technology systems, and human resources. Contact operates 11 power stations with a mix of renewable hydro, geothermal, and thermal plants, with risks from equipment damage (e.g., engine damage to gas peaking plants), supply chain constraints for spare parts, and the need for ongoing capital expenditure to maintain asset reliability.
