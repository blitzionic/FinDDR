| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Contact Energy Limited's revenue showed a fluctuating trend with NZD 2,387 million in 2022, decreasing to NZD 2,118 million in 2023, then rising significantly to NZD 2,863 million in 2024. Gross margin improved markedly from 23.75% in 2022 to 40.51% in 2023 but declined to 35.03% in 2024, indicating some cost pressures despite revenue growth. Revenue by product/service reveals that wholesale electricity net of hedging was the largest contributor, increasing from NZD 1,071 million in 2022 to NZD 1,317 million in 2024, while mass market electricity revenue steadily grew from NZD 869 million in 2022 to NZD 1,017 million in 2024. Other segments such as C&I electricity fixed price and gas also showed moderate growth. Geographic revenue data was not provided, limiting regional analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from a strong 23.75% in 2022 to 8.36% in 2023 before a slight recovery to 11.81% in 2024, reflecting challenges in maintaining operating profitability despite revenue growth. Operating income dropped sharply from NZD 567 million in 2022 to NZD 177 million in 2023, then increased to NZD 338 million in 2024, but remained well below the 2022 level. Operating expenses rose from NZD 1,820 million in 2022 to NZD 2,188 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and indicating cost management issues. The increase in cost of goods sold from NZD 1,260 million in 2023 to NZD 1,860 million in 2024 also pressured margins, suggesting rising input costs or inefficiencies. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted dramatically from a negative (28.06%) in 2022 to positive rates of 28.25% in 2023 and 30.47% in 2024, which increased the tax burden and reduced net profitability. Income tax expense moved from a tax benefit of NZD (71) million in 2022 to expenses of NZD 50 million in 2023 and NZD 103 million in 2024, impacting net profit margins. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, Contact Energy Limited demonstrated growth in total assets, increasing from NZD 5,808 million in 2023 to NZD 6,208 million, driven by rises in both current assets (from NZD 593 million to NZD 652 million) and non-current assets (from NZD 5,215 million to NZD 5,556 million). However, total liabilities also increased significantly from NZD 3,004 million to NZD 3,589 million, with both current liabilities rising from NZD 780 million to NZD 919 million and non-current liabilities from NZD 2,224 million to NZD 2,670 million. Shareholders' equity declined from NZD 2,804 million to NZD 2,619 million, and retained earnings decreased slightly from NZD 813 million to NZD 773 million. The current ratio decreased from 76.03% to 70.95%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased markedly from 107.13% to 137.04%, reflecting a higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company’s financial health shows asset growth but with increased liabilities and leverage, and a modest decline in equity base, suggesting a more leveraged position with slightly reduced liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, Contact Energy Limited showed an increase in total assets to NZD 5,808 million from NZD 5,166 million in 2022, driven by growth in both current assets (from NZD 508 million to NZD 593 million) and non-current assets (from NZD 4,658 million to NZD 5,215 million). Total liabilities rose significantly by 29.1% to NZD 3,004 million, with current liabilities increasing moderately to NZD 780 million and non-current liabilities rising sharply to NZD 2,224 million. Shareholders' equity slightly decreased to NZD 2,804 million from NZD 2,840 million, reflecting a reduction in retained earnings from NZD 959 million to NZD 813 million. The current ratio improved modestly to 76.03%, indicating a slightly better liquidity position. However, the debt to equity ratio increased substantially to 107.13% from 81.90%, signaling a higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company expanded its asset base but increased its financial obligations, slightly compressing equity and increasing leverage risk. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Contact Energy Limited’s revenue increased substantially by 35.1% from NZD 2,118 million in 2023 to NZD 2,863 million in 2024. Gross profit rose from NZD 858 million to NZD 1,003 million, but the gross margin declined from 40.51% to 35.03%, indicating higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income improved significantly from NZD 177 million to NZD 338 million, with operating margin increasing from 8.36% to 11.81%, reflecting better control or leverage of operating expenses despite their absolute increase. Net profit nearly doubled from NZD 127 million to NZD 235 million, with net profit margin improving from 6.00% to 8.21%. Return on equity (ROE) increased from 4.50% to 8.67%, and return on assets (ROA) improved from 2.31% to 3.91%, both indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns for shareholders and asset utilization. The effective tax rate rose slightly from 28.25% to 30.47%, which marginally impacted net profitability. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved markedly in 2024, driven by strong revenue growth and improved operating efficiency despite margin pressure at the gross profit level. | Revenue declined by 11.3% to NZD 2,118 million in 2023 from NZD 2,387 million in 2022. Despite this, gross profit improved markedly by 51.3% to NZD 858 million due to a significant reduction in cost of goods sold from NZD 1,820 million to NZD 1,260 million, resulting in a strong gross margin increase from 23.75% to 40.51%. Operating income, however, decreased sharply to NZD 177 million from NZD 567 million, with operating margin falling from 23.75% to 8.36%, reflecting higher operating expenses relative to gross profit. Net profit declined by 30.2% to NZD 127 million, with net profit margin decreasing from 7.62% to 6.00%. Return on equity and return on assets were reported at 4.50% and 2.31% respectively, indicating modest profitability relative to equity and asset base. The effective tax rate normalized to 28.25% from a negative rate in 2022, reflecting a more typical tax expense. Overall, earnings quality shows mixed signals: improved gross profitability but compressed operating and net margins, with lower absolute net profit. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, Contact Energy Limited showed improved efficiency in 2024. Although operating expenses increased from NZD 1,613 million to NZD 2,188 million, the company managed to increase operating income substantially, indicating effective cost management relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover improved from 38.60% to 47.65%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased significantly from NZD 395 million to NZD 580 million, demonstrating stronger cash generation from core business activities. Inventories decreased from NZD 48 million to NZD 37 million, suggesting improved inventory management. Working capital dynamics show current assets increased less proportionally than current liabilities, as reflected in the lower current ratio, but cash flow from operations remains robust. Net cash from investing activities slightly decreased from NZD 618 million to NZD 595 million, indicating sustained investment levels. Overall, operational efficiency improved with better asset utilization, stronger cash flow generation, and controlled working capital despite higher absolute costs. | Operational efficiency in 2023 shows mixed results. Cost of goods sold decreased substantially, improving gross profit margins, indicating better cost control or favorable input costs. However, operating expenses remained high at NZD 1,613 million, only slightly lower than 2022, which contributed to a reduced operating income. Asset turnover was reported at 38.60%, suggesting efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue, although no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations slightly decreased to NZD 395 million from NZD 409 million, indicating stable but slightly reduced cash generation from core activities. Inventories decreased from NZD 58 million to NZD 48 million, which may reflect improved inventory management. Overall, while cost of goods sold was well controlled, operating expenses and cash flow from operations suggest room for improvement in operational efficiency. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators reveal increased leverage and some liquidity pressure in 2024. The debt to equity ratio rose sharply from 107.13% to 137.04%, indicating higher financial leverage and potential increased risk from debt servicing. However, interest expense slightly decreased from NZD 41 million to NZD 40 million, and interest coverage ratio improved dramatically from 431.71% to 845.00%, suggesting strong earnings relative to interest obligations and low immediate risk of default. The current ratio declined from 76.03% to 70.95%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity buffer. The effective tax rate increased from 28.25% to 30.47%, which could impact net profitability. No significant changes in interest expense or tax policy beyond this are evident. Overall, while leverage and liquidity ratios suggest elevated financial risk, strong interest coverage and cash flow generation mitigate immediate solvency concerns. Close monitoring of debt levels and liquidity is advisable. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 highlight increased leverage and interest burden. The debt to equity ratio rose significantly to 107.13%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing compared to equity. Interest expense increased to NZD 41 million from NZD 36 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased substantially to 431.71% from an extremely high 1575.00% in 2022, reflecting reduced buffer to cover interest payments despite still strong coverage. The current ratio improved slightly to 76.03%, suggesting adequate short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate normalized to 28.25%, removing the unusual tax benefit seen in 2022. The increase in non-current liabilities and interest expense, combined with reduced profitability, signals elevated financial risk and potential early warning signs related to debt servicing and capital structure sustainability. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking forward, Contact Energy Limited’s sustained investment activity is indicated by a slight decrease in net cash used in investing from NZD 618 million to NZD 595 million, reflecting ongoing capital expenditure or acquisitions. Net cash from operations increased substantially, supporting cash flow sustainability and the ability to fund investments and dividends. Dividends paid increased marginally from NZD 243 million to NZD 248 million, indicating a stable or slightly growing dividend policy, which may appeal to income-focused investors. Revenue growth was broad-based across key segments, notably wholesale electricity net of hedging increased from NZD 685 million to NZD 1,317 million, and mass market electricity revenue rose from NZD 936 million to NZD 1,017 million, suggesting strong demand and potential for continued growth. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional performance insights. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued financial performance improvement supported by strong operational cash flow, ongoing investment, and stable dividend distribution, though increased leverage warrants cautious monitoring. | Looking forward, Contact Energy Limited's investing activities intensified, with net cash from investing increasing to NZD 618 million from NZD 390 million, indicating significant capital expenditure or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing also rose sharply to NZD 195 million from NZD 1 million, suggesting increased borrowing or equity financing to fund investments. Dividends remained stable at NZD 243 million, reflecting a consistent dividend policy despite lower net profits. Revenue by product shows growth in mass market electricity and commercial & industrial fixed price segments, while wholesale electricity revenue declined, indicating a possible strategic shift or market dynamics. The company’s cash flow from operations remains robust, supporting investment and dividend payments. Overall, the company appears to be investing for future growth while maintaining shareholder returns, but increased leverage and lower profitability may require careful management to sustain financial performance. |
