# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's reported revenue shows a significant decline from 2022 to 2023, dropping from 173,712 USD to 13,410 USD, a decrease of approximately 92.3%. In 2024, revenue slightly increased to 24,063 USD, representing a 79.4% increase from 2023 but still drastically lower than 2022 levels. Due to the absence of Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit data for all years, gross margin performance cannot be assessed. Additionally, no data is available on revenue breakdown by product/service or geographic region, preventing analysis of revenue composition or regional shifts. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses have increased substantially over the period, rising from (2,353,412) USD in 2022 to (3,713,941) USD in 2023, an increase of about 57.9%, before decreasing to (2,583,863) USD in 2024, a 30.4% reduction from 2023 but still above 2022 levels. Despite the revenue decline, operating expenses remain extremely high, resulting in large operating losses. Operating income data is unavailable, but net profit figures indicate severe losses: (2,353,412) USD in 2022, worsening to (3,713,941) USD in 2023, then improving to (2,583,863) USD in 2024. The net profit margin is deeply negative and deteriorated from (1,354.78%) in 2022 to (27,695.31%) in 2023, before improving to (10,737.91%) in 2024, reflecting extreme inefficiency and cost management challenges relative to revenue. |
| External & One-Off Impact | No data is provided on income tax expense or effective tax rates for any year, limiting analysis of tax impact on profitability. There is no information on non-recurring items or unusual patterns, nor any external factors affecting profitability mentioned in the data. The absence of such data restricts insights into external or one-off influences on the company's financial performance. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a significantly stronger financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased from 27,008,562 USD to 35,540,560 USD, reflecting robust asset growth driven by both current assets, which rose markedly from 1,625,877 USD to 6,003,092 USD, and non-current assets, which increased from 25,382,685 USD to 29,537,468 USD. Total liabilities decreased from 1,503,868 USD to 1,028,090 USD, indicating effective liability management and a reduction in financial obligations. Shareholders' equity improved substantially from 25,504,693 USD to 34,512,470 USD, reinforcing a solid equity base. The current ratio surged from 115.77% to 692.97%, highlighting a significant enhancement in liquidity and short-term financial stability. The debt to equity ratio declined from 5.90% to 2.98%, suggesting a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the balance sheet strength and liquidity position improved markedly in 2024, positioning the company well for financial resilience. | In 2023, the company demonstrated an improved overall financial position with total assets increasing from USD 22,818,366 in 2022 to USD 27,008,562, reflecting significant asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from USD 19,491,917 to USD 25,382,685. Total liabilities decreased from USD 1,999,557 to USD 1,503,868, indicating effective liability management and a stronger balance sheet. Shareholders' equity increased substantially from USD 20,818,809 to USD 25,504,693, reinforcing the company's capital base. However, current assets declined from USD 3,326,448 to USD 1,625,877, which, combined with a decrease in current liabilities from USD 1,872,694 to USD 1,404,428, led to a lower current ratio of 115.77% in 2023 compared to 177.63% in 2022, suggesting reduced but still adequate liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved from 9.60% to 5.90%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 shows stronger equity and asset growth with controlled liabilities, though liquidity has moderated compared to the prior year. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue nearly doubled from 13,410 USD in 2023 to 24,063 USD in 2024, indicating strong top-line growth. However, profitability remains negative with net profit losses improving but still substantial, moving from (3,713,941) USD in 2023 to (2,583,863) USD in 2024. The net profit margin, while still negative, improved significantly from (27,695.31%) in 2023 to (10,737.91%) in 2024, reflecting better cost control or revenue scaling effects. Operating expenses decreased from (3,713,941) USD to (2,583,863) USD, supporting improved earnings quality. Return on equity and return on assets remain negative but improved from (16.03%) to (8.61%) and (14.91%) to (8.26%) respectively, indicating the company is moving towards profitability but has not yet achieved sustainable earnings. Gross and operating margins are unavailable, limiting margin analysis. Overall, while losses persist, the trend in profitability and earnings quality is positive in 2024. | The company’s profitability in 2023 deteriorated significantly compared to 2022. Revenue dropped sharply from USD 173,712 in 2022 to USD 13,410 in 2023, indicating a severe contraction in sales. Operating expenses increased markedly from USD (2,353,412) to USD (3,713,941), exacerbating losses. Net profit worsened from a loss of USD (2,353,412) in 2022 to a larger loss of USD (3,713,941) in 2023. The net profit margin, already negative at (1354.78%) in 2022, further deteriorated to (27,695.31%) in 2023, reflecting extremely poor earnings quality and unsustainable losses relative to revenue. Return on equity and return on assets were negative at (16.03%) and (14.91%) respectively, indicating that the company destroyed shareholder value and failed to generate returns from its asset base. Absence of gross profit and operating income data limits margin analysis, but the available data clearly shows worsening profitability and earnings quality in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses decreased significantly in 2024 compared to 2023, from (3,713,941) USD to (2,583,863) USD, indicating improved cost control. Asset turnover increased from 0.05% to 0.08%, showing better utilization of assets to generate revenue, though still at a low level. Net cash from operations remains negative but improved from (1,871,148) USD to (1,553,743) USD, suggesting ongoing operational cash flow challenges but with a positive trend. Working capital improved substantially as current assets increased and current liabilities decreased, contributing to a much higher current ratio of 692.97%. These factors collectively indicate enhanced operational efficiency, though the company still faces challenges in generating positive operating cash flow. | Operational efficiency declined in 2023 as evidenced by increased operating expenses and reduced revenue. The operating expense rose from USD (2,353,412) in 2022 to USD (3,713,941) in 2023 despite a drastic revenue decline, indicating poor cost control. Asset turnover was extremely low at 0.05%, suggesting inefficient use of assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations worsened from a negative USD (938,036) in 2022 to a deeper negative USD (1,871,148) in 2023, highlighting cash flow challenges from core business activities. Working capital, while positive, decreased as current assets fell more sharply than current liabilities, reducing liquidity available for operations. Overall, the company’s operational efficiency deteriorated in 2023 with higher costs, poor asset utilization, and negative operating cash flow. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage risk decreased in 2024 as evidenced by a reduction in the debt to equity ratio from 5.90% to 2.98%, indicating lower reliance on debt financing. Liquidity risk is substantially reduced with the current ratio increasing to 692.97%, reflecting strong short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased slightly from (6,666) USD to (8,745) USD, but interest coverage data is unavailable, limiting assessment of the company's ability to service debt from operating income. The effective tax rate is not provided, and income tax expense is unavailable, so tax-related risks cannot be assessed. Despite ongoing net losses, the company’s improved liquidity and reduced leverage mitigate some financial risks, but negative earnings and cash flow from operations remain areas of concern. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show mixed signals. Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio improved from 9.60% to 5.90%, reducing financial risk from excessive borrowing. Current ratio declined from 177.63% to 115.77%, indicating reduced but still adequate short-term liquidity. Interest expense slightly increased from USD (6,501) to USD (6,666), but interest coverage ratio is unavailable, limiting assessment of ability to service debt. The company reported no income tax expense in 2023, and effective tax rate data is unavailable, so tax-related risks cannot be assessed. The large and increasing net losses, combined with negative operating cash flows, represent significant operational and earnings risks. Overall, while leverage risk has decreased, liquidity and earnings risks remain elevated, signaling caution. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities, as reflected by net cash from investing, show a reduction in cash outflows from (7,168,021) USD in 2023 to (5,011,552) USD in 2024, suggesting a moderation in capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing increased significantly from 7,180,732 USD to 11,015,929 USD, indicating increased external financing or capital raising activities to support growth or liquidity. The net increase in cash turned positive in 2024 at 4,450,634 USD compared to a decrease in 2023, supporting cash flow sustainability. No dividends were paid in either year, implying retention of earnings or cash for reinvestment. Revenue growth and improved balance sheet metrics suggest positive market or segment trends, though geographic or product-specific data is unavailable. Overall, the company appears to be investing for growth with improving cash flow dynamics, but continued monitoring of operational profitability and cash flow generation will be critical for future financial performance. | The company’s future financial performance outlook based on 2023 data appears challenging. Net cash used in investing activities increased from USD (5,606,676) to USD (7,168,021), indicating substantial investment outflows which may support future growth but also strain cash resources. Net cash from financing activities turned positive to USD 7,180,732 in 2023 from a negative USD (85,613) in 2022, suggesting new financing inflows that may provide liquidity support. Despite these inflows, net cash decreased by USD (1,858,437) in 2023, reflecting ongoing cash burn. No dividends were paid in either year, consistent with conserving cash. Absence of revenue breakdown by product or geography limits market trend analysis. Given the worsening profitability, negative operating cash flow, and heavy investing outflows, the company faces sustainability challenges unless operational performance improves. However, increased financing inflows may provide a buffer for near-term liquidity and investment needs. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Astral Resources NL operates primarily as a mineral exploration and development company focused on gold projects in Australia. The Group's principal activities consist of exploration and evaluation programs at its 100% owned Mandilla and Feysville Gold Projects, with the objective of transitioning from an explorer to a producer. Revenue generation is minimal and primarily from other income sources such as government grants, GST refunds, and rental income, as the company is currently in the exploration and evaluation phase rather than production. The company funds its operations mainly through equity raisings, including placements and share purchase plans, as it does not have ready access to credit facilities. The business model is centered on advancing exploration projects to a stage where they can be developed into producing mines, thereby creating shareholder value through resource development and potential future gold production. | The company's primary business model is mineral exploration and development, focusing on exploration and evaluation programs at its 100% owned Mandilla and Feysville Gold Projects in Australia. It generates revenue primarily through interest income and potentially through the sale or disposal of exploration and evaluation assets, although no significant product sales or production revenue is reported as the company is transitioning from explorer to producer. The company funds its operations mainly through equity raisings, including placements and entitlement offers, and does not currently have access to credit facilities. It incurs expenses related to exploration activities, corporate costs, employee benefits, and share-based payments. The business model is centered on advancing exploration projects to resource definition and feasibility study stages to enhance shareholder value. |
| Market Position | Astral Resources NL is positioned as an exploration company in the Australian gold mining sector, focusing on the Kalgoorlie region. It is not yet a producer and thus does not have a market share in gold production. However, it holds a significant mineral resource base with a total Mineral Resource Estimate of approximately 1.4 million ounces of gold across its Mandilla and Feysville projects. Mandilla is described as one of the largest undeveloped free-milling open pit gold development projects in the Kalgoorlie region, indicating a strong potential competitive position upon development. The company is progressing through feasibility studies and resource definition drilling to advance towards production. It operates in a region with world-class deposits owned by major companies, suggesting it is a niche player with growth potential rather than a current market leader or challenger in gold production. Specific market share percentages or competitive rankings are not provided. | The company operates as a mineral exploration entity in Australia with a focus on the Mandilla and Feysville Gold Projects. It is currently in the exploration and development phase and is not yet a producer. The company is not described as a market leader, challenger, or niche player in terms of market share or competitive ranking, and no specific market share data is provided. The competitive advantage lies in its significant exploration efforts, including extensive drilling programs and substantial increases in mineral resource estimates (e.g., a 62% increase in contained gold ounces at Mandilla since January 2022). The company is progressing towards transitioning from an explorer to a producer, indicating a growth-oriented position but without explicit market share or competitive position data. |


# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |

| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices that could affect income or the value of financial instruments. However, the Group currently has little or no exposure to commodity price risk as it is at an early development stage. Market risk management aims to control exposures within acceptable parameters. The Group operates in the mineral exploration sector in Australia, where demand volatility, competition, and industry trends may impact business prospects. The risk of exploration failure is inherent and acknowledged, with uncertainty about achieving business strategy objectives. The Group's ability to raise capital through equity markets is critical to its ongoing operations and growth, with no guarantee of securing additional funding. The Group also monitors customer and market behavior through its business strategies focused on exploration and evaluation programs and progressing studies to advance projects. | The Group faces market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices that could affect income or the value of financial instruments.

The Company operates in the mineral exploration sector in Australia, with risks inherent in exploration failure and the uncertainty of achieving business objectives. Market risk management aims to control exposures within acceptable parameters. The Group's share price has shown volatility, and the ability to raise capital through equity markets is critical to ongoing operations. There is also risk related to competition, demand volatility, and industry trends inherent in the mineral exploration industry, although these are not explicitly detailed. The Group's strategy includes continuing exploration and evaluation programs and progressing studies to transition from explorer to producer, which may be impacted by market conditions. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include inherent risks in exploration activities such as land disturbance, waste disposal, and environmental impacts that could cause delays, additional costs, or penalties. The Group operates under significant environmental regulations in Western Australia and the Commonwealth, aiming to comply with all relevant legislation and maintain high environmental standards. There is a risk related to Native Title and Heritage rights, with the Company required to ensure tenure is adequately surveyed and considered before activities that disturb the environment. The Group has procedures to minimize environmental impacts but acknowledges some risks cannot be fully mitigated. Operational challenges also include managing exploration and evaluation activities, maintaining business continuity, and ensuring quality in product development. The Group's supply chain and technology system risks are not explicitly detailed. The Group also faces risks related to impairment of exploration and evaluation assets if commercial viability is not demonstrated or licenses expire. | Operational risks include the inherent risks of exploration failure, with no certainty that exploration objectives will be achieved. The Group's activities involve land disturbance and waste disposal, which carry environmental risks that could lead to delays, additional costs, or penalties. The Group has procedures to minimize environmental impacts but acknowledges that some risks cannot be fully mitigated. The Group also faces risks related to business continuity and day-to-day operations, including managing exploration programs and corporate overheads within available funds. There is a risk of impairment of exploration and evaluation assets if technical feasibility or commercial viability is not demonstrated. The Group's operations are subject to environmental regulations and heritage laws, including Native Title and Heritage rights, which pose compliance and operational risks. The Group manages operational risks through adherence to environmental legislation, maintaining adequate cash reserves, and the ability to curtail discretionary expenditures as needed. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks identified include credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk is low due to counterparties being reliable and cash invested only with major A+ rated Australian financial institutions. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash reserves from capital raisings and monitoring cash flows to meet liabilities as they fall due. The Group had sufficient cash reserves as of 30 June 2024 and secured a $25 million placement in September 2024 to fund operations through to the Final Investment Decision. The Group does not have credit standby facilities or other funding arrangements. Interest rate risk arises primarily from cash and interest-bearing liabilities, with no derivatives used to mitigate this risk. The Group manages capital risk by focusing on maintaining liquidity to meet exploration and corporate overheads, primarily through equity raisings. The Group's financial liabilities mainly consist of trade payables and lease liabilities, which are non-interest bearing or fixed. The Group's financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, dependent on successful capital raising and cash flow management. | Financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk is limited as the Group invests only with major Australian financial institutions rated A+ and has low exposure on trade and other receivables. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining sufficient cash reserves, monitoring cash flows, and raising capital through equity placements and share purchase plans. The Group had sufficient cash reserves at the reporting date but relies heavily on equity raisings for funding, with no credit standby facilities in place. Interest rate risk arises primarily from cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing liabilities; however, the Group does not use derivatives to mitigate this risk. The Group's capital risk management focuses on maintaining liquidity to meet exploration and overhead costs, with the ability to issue additional equity securities and curtail expenditures if necessary. The Group recognizes the risk that additional funding may dilute shareholdings and that debt financing may be restricted. The Group also has provisions for rehabilitation costs, which could materially change based on future estimates and regulatory changes. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks include adherence to environmental regulations under Commonwealth and Western Australian laws, with the Group aiming to meet the highest environmental care standards and currently unaware of any significant breaches. The Group is subject to Native Title and Heritage laws requiring proper tenure surveys and compliance, with some inherent risks that cannot be fully mitigated. The Group complies with statutory obligations related to financial reporting under Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001. There are risks related to legal and regulatory compliance in exploration activities, including potential penalties for environmental incidents such as incorrect waste disposal. The Group engages third parties where appropriate to ensure compliance with Native Title and Heritage requirements. No other specific legal or regulatory compliance risks or mitigation measures are detailed. | Compliance risks relate to adherence to environmental regulations under Commonwealth and Western Australian laws, including environmental care standards and waste disposal requirements.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces economic challenges primarily related to liquidity and capital requirements. The Company relies heavily on equity raisings as its primary source of funding due to limited access to credit facilities, which introduces uncertainty regarding the availability of future capital. Additional funding beyond current plans will be required for expanded exploration activities, with no guarantee of securing such funding, potentially leading to dilution of shareholdings or restrictions if debt financing is pursued. Market risks include fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices, which could impact income and financial instrument values, although the Group currently has little exposure to commodity price risk. Cost pressures and environmental compliance obligations also pose risks, including potential delays and additional costs from environmental incidents. The Group's ability to continue as a going concern depends on successfully raising capital and managing cash flows, with current cash reserves sufficient only through to the Final Investment Decision (FID). Economic uncertainties include risks of exploration failure and the inherent unpredictability of mineral exploration outcomes. | The Company faces economic challenges primarily related to liquidity and capital raising risks. The Group's ability to continue as a going concern depends on securing funds through equity markets and managing cash flows within available funds. The Group has limited access to credit facilities, relying mainly on equity raisings to fund exploration and corporate overheads. There is uncertainty regarding the availability of additional funding beyond current plans, which may require reducing the scope of future exploration programs. Market risks include fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices, which could affect income and financial instrument values. Inflation and cost pressures are implied through increased employee expenses and corporate costs. The Group also faces risks from environmental regulations and potential penalties related to exploration activities. Additionally, impairment risks exist for exploration assets if commercial viability is not demonstrated or if licenses expire without renewal. Macroeconomic uncertainties and market conditions could impact the Group's revenue and profitability, especially given its exploration stage and reliance on capital markets. |
