# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Astral Resources NL's revenue shows a significant decline from 173,712 USD in 2022 to 13,410 USD in 2023, followed by a moderate increase to 24,063 USD in 2024. Revenue is solely derived from mineral exploration and development for the years 2023 and 2024, with no geographic revenue breakdown available. Gross margin data is not provided, preventing direct analysis of profitability at the gross level. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin and operating income figures are not available for any year, limiting direct assessment of operating efficiency. However, the operating expense reported for 2023 is a substantial negative 4,521,973 USD, indicating high costs relative to revenue. The net profit margin is deeply negative across all years, worsening from (1,354.78%) in 2022 to (27,695.31%) in 2023, then improving to (10,737.91%) in 2024, reflecting ongoing operating inefficiencies and cost management challenges despite some revenue recovery in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remains consistently at -0.00% from 2022 through 2024, indicating no tax expense impact on profitability. No non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability are explicitly listed in the provided financial data, suggesting that the losses and margins are primarily driven by core operational performance rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Astral Resources NL demonstrated a significant strengthening in its financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased markedly from USD 27,008,562 to USD 35,540,560, driven by growth in both current assets (from USD 1,625,877 to USD 6,003,092) and non-current assets (from USD 25,382,685 to USD 29,537,468). Total liabilities decreased from USD 1,503,868 to USD 1,028,090, reflecting improved liability management. The current liabilities reduced substantially from USD 1,404,428 to USD 866,286, while non-current liabilities increased slightly from USD 99,440 to USD 161,804. Shareholders' equity rose significantly from USD 25,504,693 to USD 34,512,470, indicating enhanced net worth. The current ratio improved dramatically from 115.77% to 692.97%, signaling a very strong liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio halved from 5.90% to 2.98%, showing a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2024 is robust with strong asset growth, reduced liabilities, and improved liquidity and capital structure metrics. | In 2023, Astral Resources NL demonstrated an increase in total assets to USD 27,008,562 from USD 22,818,366 in 2022, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets from USD 19,491,917 to USD 25,382,685. Current assets, however, declined significantly from USD 3,326,448 to USD 1,625,877, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity resources. Total liabilities decreased from USD 1,999,557 in 2022 to USD 1,503,868 in 2023, with both current and non-current liabilities showing declines. Shareholders' equity increased substantially to USD 25,504,693 from USD 20,818,809, reflecting retained losses accumulation and asset growth. The current ratio fell from 177.63% to 115.77%, indicating a decrease in liquidity but still above 1, suggesting the company can cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio improved from 9.60% to 5.90%, showing a lower reliance on debt financing and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 shows asset growth and equity strengthening, but with reduced liquidity and continued negative retained earnings. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability remains a challenge for Astral Resources NL in 2024 despite revenue growth. Revenue increased substantially by approximately 79% from USD 13,410 in 2023 to USD 24,063 in 2024, driven solely by mineral exploration and development activities. However, the company reported a net loss of USD 2,583,863 in 2024, an improvement from the larger net loss of USD 3,713,941 in 2023. The net profit margin, while still negative, improved significantly from -27,695.31% in 2023 to -10,737.91% in 2024, indicating better earnings quality though still unprofitable. Income before taxes mirrored net loss figures, and no income tax expense was recorded in either year, consistent with losses. Interest expense increased slightly from USD 6,666 to USD 8,745, but remains low relative to equity. Return on equity improved from -16.03% to -8.61%, and return on assets improved from -14.91% to -8.26%, reflecting better but still negative returns. Gross and operating margins are unavailable, limiting margin analysis. Overall, while losses persist, the company’s profitability and earnings quality show meaningful improvement in 2024. | Astral Resources NL’s revenue declined sharply from USD 173,712 in 2022 to USD 13,410 in 2023, indicating a significant drop in top-line performance. Cost of goods sold and gross profit data are unavailable, limiting margin analysis. Operating expenses were substantial at negative USD 4,521,973 in 2023, contributing to a net loss of USD 3,713,941, which worsened compared to the 2022 net loss of USD 2,353,412. The net profit margin deteriorated drastically from -1354.78% in 2022 to -27,695.31% in 2023, reflecting extremely poor earnings quality and profitability. Return on equity and return on assets were negative at -16.03% and -14.91%, respectively, confirming unprofitable operations relative to equity and asset base. No income tax expense was recorded in either year, consistent with losses. Interest expense remained low and stable. Overall, profitability and earnings quality in 2023 were significantly impaired with steep revenue decline and large operating losses. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency shows mixed signals in 2024. Revenue nearly doubled, yet net cash from operations remains negative at USD (1,553,743), though improved from USD (1,871,148) in 2023, indicating ongoing operational cash burn but at a reduced rate. Operating expenses for 2024 are unavailable, limiting cost control assessment, but the improvement in net loss suggests some operational improvements. Asset turnover increased from 0.05% to 0.08%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue, though still very low, reflecting the capital-intensive nature of the business. Working capital improved significantly due to a large increase in current assets and a decrease in current liabilities, supporting operational liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities remains negative at USD (5,011,552), though less negative than 2023, indicating continued investment in long-term assets. Financing cash inflows increased substantially to USD 11,015,929, supporting liquidity and investment needs. Overall, operational efficiency is improving with better asset utilization and reduced operational cash outflows, but the company continues to operate at a cash deficit from operations. | Operational efficiency in 2023 appears weak. The company’s asset turnover ratio was very low at 0.05%, indicating poor utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations worsened to a negative USD 1,871,148 from negative USD 938,036 in 2022, showing increased cash outflows from core business activities. Working capital decreased as current assets dropped and current liabilities declined less proportionally, reflected in the reduced current ratio. Operating expenses were very high relative to revenue, suggesting poor cost control or high fixed costs. Cash flow from investing activities was negative USD 7,168,021, indicating significant investment outflows, while financing cash inflows of USD 7,180,732 suggest capital raising or debt issuance to support operations. The net decrease in cash was USD 1,858,437, an improvement from 2022 but still negative. Overall, operational efficiency is challenged by low revenue generation, high operating expenses, and negative operating cash flow. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for 2024 suggest reduced leverage and improved liquidity risk but ongoing operational and profitability risks. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 2.98% from 5.90%, indicating lower financial leverage and reduced solvency risk. The current ratio surged to 692.97%, reflecting very strong short-term liquidity and a comfortable buffer to meet current obligations. Interest expense increased slightly but remains minimal relative to equity, and interest coverage data is unavailable, limiting assessment of ability to service debt from earnings. The effective tax rate remained at -0.00%, consistent with losses and no tax expense. The company’s continued net losses and negative operating cash flow represent operational risks and potential sustainability concerns if losses persist. No dividends were paid in either year, consistent with loss-making status. No geographic or segment risks can be assessed due to unavailable data. Overall, financial risk from leverage and liquidity is low, but operational losses and negative cash flow pose ongoing risks. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show moderate leverage and liquidity risk. The debt to equity ratio improved to 5.90%, indicating low financial leverage and reduced solvency risk. The current ratio of 115.77% suggests the company maintains sufficient short-term assets to cover liabilities, though liquidity has declined from 2022. Interest expense remained low at USD 6,666, but interest coverage ratio is unavailable, limiting assessment of ability to service debt from earnings. The effective tax rate remained at zero, consistent with losses and no tax expense. The large negative retained earnings of USD 42,968,149 highlight accumulated losses, posing a risk to equity stability. The steep decline in revenue and negative operating cash flow raise concerns about ongoing operational viability. No dividends were paid, reflecting cash conservation. Overall, financial risk is moderate with low leverage but operational and earnings risks are elevated. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking forward, Astral Resources NL’s future financial performance will likely depend on sustaining revenue growth and improving operational cash flow. The company continues to invest heavily in non-current assets, as evidenced by negative net cash from investing activities of USD (5,011,552), though this is less than in 2023, suggesting a possible moderation in capital expenditures. Financing activities provided strong cash inflows of USD 11,015,929, indicating access to capital markets or financing sources to support growth and liquidity. The absence of dividends in 2024 and 2023 suggests a focus on reinvestment rather than shareholder returns at this stage. The significant increase in current assets and strong liquidity position provide a cushion for ongoing operations and investments. However, continued net losses and negative operating cash flow highlight the need for improved profitability and cash generation to ensure sustainability. No geographic or segment diversification data is available to assess growth drivers. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued investment-led growth with manageable financial risk, but profitability and cash flow improvements are critical for future financial stability. | Looking forward, Astral Resources NL’s future financial performance appears uncertain. The company invested heavily in non-current assets with net cash outflows from investing activities of USD 7,168,021, signaling ongoing capital expenditure likely related to mineral exploration and development. Financing cash inflows of USD 7,180,732 suggest recent capital raising to fund these investments and operations, which may support future growth. However, the steep revenue decline and negative operating cash flow raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. No dividends were declared, indicating a conservative dividend policy focused on reinvestment or debt reduction. Revenue is derived solely from mineral exploration and development, with no geographic revenue data available, limiting diversification insights. The company’s ability to convert investments into profitable operations and positive cash flow will be critical. Continued capital support and improved operational efficiency will be necessary to enhance future financial performance. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | Astral Resources NL operates primarily as a mineral exploration and development company focused on gold projects in Australia. The Group's principal activities consist of exploration and evaluation of mineral resources, specifically at its 100% owned Mandilla and Feysville Gold Projects. The company generates revenue mainly through government grants, GST refunds, and rental income, as indicated by trade and other receivables. However, the company is currently in the exploration and evaluation phase and has not reported significant operating revenue from mineral production or sales. The business model relies heavily on raising capital through equity placements to fund exploration and development activities, as the Group does not have ready access to credit facilities. The company aims to transition from an explorer to a producer by advancing projects through scoping and pre-feasibility studies and eventually developing mining operations. Key revenue generation is expected in the future from gold production once projects move into the production phase. | The company's primary business model is mineral exploration and development, focusing on exploration and evaluation programs at its 100% owned Mandilla and Feysville Gold Projects in Australia. It generates revenue primarily through interest income and potentially through the sale or disposal of exploration and evaluation assets, although no significant product sales or production revenue is reported as the company is transitioning from explorer to producer. The company funds its operations mainly through equity raisings and placements, as it does not have ready access to credit facilities. Key activities include extensive drilling programs and resource estimation to increase contained gold ounces, aiming to progress from exploration to production. |
| Market Position | Astral Resources NL is positioned as an exploration company in the Australian gold mining sector, focusing on the Kalgoorlie region. It is not currently a producer and thus does not hold a market share in gold production.

The Group operates in the mineral exploration sector in Australia, which is subject to market conditions and industry trends that may impact demand and competition. The risk of exploration failure is inherent due to the uncertain nature of exploration activities, with no certainty that business objectives will be achieved. The Group's share price has shown volatility, reflecting market conditions. The Group's ability to raise capital through equity placements and share purchase plans is critical to managing market risk and funding operations. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include the inherent risks of exploration failure, with no certainty that exploration objectives will be achieved. The Group's exploration activities involve environmental risks such as land disturbance and waste disposal, which could lead to delays, additional costs, or legislative penalties. The Company has procedures to minimize environmental impacts but acknowledges that some risks cannot be fully mitigated. The Group also faces risks related to business continuity and day-to-day operations, including managing commitments for minimum exploration expenditure and ensuring operational activities comply with environmental and heritage regulations. The Group relies on key personnel and management judgments in exploration and evaluation, which carry risks of estimation and operational execution. | Operational risks include the inherent risks of exploration failure, as exploration activities are inherently risky and uncertain. The Group's operations involve mechanised exploration which impacts the local environment, posing environmental risks such as land disturbance and waste disposal issues that could cause delays, additional costs, or penalties. The Group has implemented procedures to minimize environmental impacts and comply with environmental legislation. There are risks related to heritage and Native Title compliance, with inherent risks that cannot be fully mitigated. The Group also faces risks related to business continuity and managing day-to-day operations within the constraints of available funding. The Group's ability to continue exploration and development activities depends on securing sufficient funding and managing operational costs. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks include credit risk, which is currently low due to counterparties being reliable and cash held with A+ rated Australian financial institutions. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash reserves and monitoring cash flows; the Group had sufficient cash reserves as of 30 June 2024 and has raised approximately $25 million through a two-tranche share placement to fund operations through to Final Investment Decision (FID). Interest rate risk exists primarily on cash and interest-bearing liabilities, but the Group does not use derivatives to mitigate this risk. The Group's capital risk management focuses on maintaining liquidity to meet exploration and corporate overheads, with primary funding from equity raisings and no access to credit facilities. The Group has trade payables and lease liabilities with contractual maturities within normal terms. There is exposure to potential impairment of exploration and evaluation assets if commercial viability is not demonstrated. | Financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk is low as the Group limits exposure by investing only with major Australian financial institutions rated A+ and has no significant concentrations of credit risk. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash reserves from capital raisings and monitoring cash flows to meet liabilities as they fall due. The Group secured $3 million via a share placement and approximately $1.6 million via a Share Purchase Plan in 2023 to support liquidity. The Group has no credit standby facilities or further funding arrangements in place. Interest rate risk arises primarily from cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing liabilities; however, the Group does not use derivatives to mitigate this risk. The Group's capital management focuses on maintaining liquidity to meet exploration programs and overheads, primarily through equity raisings, as access to credit facilities is limited. The Group's going concern status depends on its ability to raise capital and manage cash flows effectively. |
