# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Astral Resources NL's revenue shows a sharp decline from 173,712 AUD in 2022 to 13,410 AUD in 2023, followed by a moderate increase to 24,063 AUD in 2024. The gross margin remains consistently around 100%, with 100.10% in 2023 and 100.05% in 2024, indicating that cost of goods sold closely matches revenue in these years. Revenue is solely derived from mineral exploration and development activities in Australia across all three years, with no diversification in product or geographic revenue streams. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin deteriorated significantly from an unavailable figure in 2022 to (27,695.31%) in 2023 and (10,737.91%) in 2024, reflecting substantial operating losses relative to revenue. Operating income was negative and worsened from (3,713,941) AUD in 2023 to (2,583,863) AUD in 2024 despite the revenue increase, indicating persistent operational inefficiencies. Operating expenses were extremely high and inconsistent, with a negative expense reported in 2022 (-3,675,949 AUD), then positive and matching operating income losses in 2023 and 2024, suggesting possible accounting anomalies or restructuring costs impacting cost management. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate dropped from 100.00% in 2022 to approximately 0.00% in both 2023 and 2024, which coincides with the transition from net profit of 2,353,412 AUD in 2022 to net losses of (3,713,941) AUD and (2,583,863) AUD in 2023 and 2024 respectively, indicating no tax expense due to losses. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability are listed in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Astral Resources NL demonstrated a significant strengthening in its financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased markedly from AUD 27,008,562 to AUD 35,540,560, driven by growth in both current assets (from AUD 1,625,877 to AUD 6,003,092) and non-current assets (from AUD 25,382,685 to AUD 29,537,468). Total liabilities decreased from AUD 1,503,868 to AUD 1,028,090, reflecting improved liability management. This reduction in liabilities alongside asset growth led to a substantial increase in shareholders' equity from AUD 25,504,693 to AUD 34,512,470. The current ratio improved dramatically from 115.77% to 692.97%, indicating a very strong liquidity position and excellent short-term financial health. The debt to equity ratio halved from 5.90% to 2.98%, showing a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the company’s balance sheet in 2024 reflects enhanced financial stability, strong liquidity, and a solid equity base. | In 2023, Astral Resources NL demonstrated an increase in total assets to AUD 27,008,562 from AUD 22,818,366 in 2022, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets (AUD 25,382,685 in 2023 vs AUD 19,491,917 in 2022). Total liabilities decreased to AUD 1,503,868 from AUD 1,999,557, reflecting a reduction in both current and non-current liabilities. Shareholders' equity increased significantly to AUD 25,504,693 from AUD 20,818,809, supported by higher retained earnings (AUD 42,968,149 in 2023 vs AUD 39,199,208 in 2022). Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 177.63% in 2022 to 115.77% in 2023, indicating a reduction in current assets relative to current liabilities but still maintaining a comfortable liquidity buffer. The debt to equity ratio improved to 5.90% from 9.60%, suggesting a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the company’s financial health shows asset growth and equity strengthening, with reduced liabilities and moderate liquidity contraction but still robust capital structure in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Astral Resources NL’s revenue nearly doubled in 2024, rising from AUD 13,410 to AUD 24,063, driven entirely by mineral exploration and development activities in Australia. Despite this revenue growth, the company remained unprofitable with a net loss of AUD 2,583,863, an improvement from the prior year’s loss of AUD 3,713,941. Gross profit turned positive at AUD 12,289 in 2024 compared to zero in 2023, reflecting improved cost of goods sold management (reduced from AUD 13,410 to AUD 11,774). However, operating expenses remained high at AUD 2,596,152, though lower than 2023’s AUD 3,713,941, resulting in a negative operating income of AUD 2,583,863. Margins remain negative but improved: gross margin stayed stable at approximately 100%, while operating and net profit margins improved significantly from around -27,695% to -10,738%. Return on equity and assets, though still negative, improved from -16.03% to -8.61% and -14.91% to -8.26%, respectively. The absence of income tax expense and a stable effective tax rate of zero reflect ongoing losses. Overall, while profitability remains negative, the company shows clear progress in reducing losses and improving earnings quality. | Astral Resources NL experienced a sharp decline in revenue from AUD 173,712 in 2022 to AUD 13,410 in 2023, all derived from mineral exploration and development in Australia. Cost of goods sold in 2023 matched revenue exactly, resulting in a gross profit of zero and an unusually high gross margin of 100.10%, which likely reflects accounting or classification nuances rather than operational profitability. Operating expenses surged dramatically to AUD 3,713,941 in 2023, leading to an operating loss of the same amount and a deeply negative operating margin of (27,695.31)%. Consequently, the net profit turned negative at (AUD 3,713,941) compared to a net profit of AUD 2,353,412 in 2022, resulting in a net profit margin of (27,695.31)%. Return on equity and return on assets were negative at (16.03)% and (14.91)% respectively, indicating poor earnings quality and significant losses relative to invested capital and assets. The effective tax rate dropped to zero from 100% in 2022, consistent with the loss position. Overall, 2023 was marked by severe profitability deterioration and negative earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 showed mixed results. Revenue growth outpaced asset growth, with asset turnover increasing from 0.05% to 0.08%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate sales. Cost control improved as cost of goods sold decreased in absolute terms despite higher revenue, contributing to positive gross profit. Operating expenses decreased by approximately 30%, from AUD 3,713,941 to AUD 2,596,152, signaling better expense management. Net cash from operations declined slightly from AUD 1,871,148 to AUD 1,553,743, suggesting some pressure on cash generation despite improved operational metrics. Working capital improved significantly due to a large increase in current assets and a decrease in current liabilities, supporting liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities decreased from AUD 7,168,021 to AUD 5,011,552, indicating reduced investment outflows. Net cash from financing increased substantially from AUD 7,180,732 to AUD 11,015,929, reflecting increased financing activities. Overall, the company improved cost control and asset utilization but faces challenges in sustaining operational cash flow growth. | Operational efficiency in 2023 deteriorated markedly. Despite generating positive net cash from operations of AUD 1,871,148, which improved from AUD 938,036 in 2022, the company’s revenue drastically declined, and operating expenses ballooned. Asset turnover was very low at 0.05, reflecting poor utilization of the significantly increased asset base. The large operating loss contrasts with positive operating cash flow, suggesting non-cash charges or working capital management contributed to cash generation. Current assets decreased to AUD 1,625,877 from AUD 3,326,448, while current liabilities also declined, supporting a current ratio of 115.77%. The absence of inventory data limits assessment of inventory management. Overall, cost control appears weak given the high operating expenses relative to revenue, but cash flow from operations shows some resilience, indicating mixed operational efficiency. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for 2024 suggest a reduced risk profile compared to 2023. The debt to equity ratio dropped from 5.90% to 2.98%, indicating lower leverage and reduced solvency risk. The current ratio surged to 692.97%, reflecting exceptional liquidity and a strong buffer against short-term obligations. Interest expense increased slightly from AUD 6,666 to AUD 8,745, but interest coverage remains extremely high at 29,546.75%, down from 55,714.69%, indicating ample capacity to meet interest obligations. The effective tax rate remained at zero, consistent with ongoing losses and no tax liabilities. No inventories data is available, which limits assessment of inventory risk. The company’s large negative operating and net margins, while improved, still represent operational risk. Overall, the company’s financial risk is low in terms of leverage and liquidity, but ongoing losses and negative profitability remain key risks. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a mixed picture. Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio improved to 5.90% from 9.60%, reducing financial risk from indebtedness. Liquidity, while lower than 2022, remains adequate with a current ratio of 115.77%. Interest expense was negative at (AUD 6,666), which may indicate interest income or accounting adjustments, and interest coverage is extremely high at 55,714.69%, suggesting no immediate risk from interest obligations. The effective tax rate dropped to zero from 100%, consistent with losses and no tax expense. However, the massive operating loss and negative profitability pose operational risks. The large increase in net cash from financing (AUD 7,180,732) may indicate increased external funding, which could introduce future risk if not managed prudently. No inventory data and the extreme margins suggest potential accounting or operational anomalies. Overall, financial risk from leverage and liquidity is low, but operational losses and unusual financial metrics warrant caution. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Astral Resources NL’s financial performance is likely to be influenced by its investment and financing activities. The company reduced net cash outflows from investing activities from AUD 7,168,021 to AUD 5,011,552, which may indicate a moderation in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions. Meanwhile, net cash from financing increased significantly to AUD 11,015,929, suggesting reliance on external funding to support operations and growth. The strong increase in cash reserves (net increase in cash of AUD 4,450,634) supports liquidity and operational flexibility. No dividends were paid in 2023 and data for 2024 is unavailable, implying a conservative dividend policy focused on reinvestment. Revenue growth in mineral exploration and development in Australia is robust, doubling year-over-year, which bodes well for future top-line expansion. However, sustained losses and negative margins highlight the need for continued cost control and operational improvements to achieve profitability. The company’s strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide a solid foundation for future growth, but careful management of financing and operational efficiency will be critical to improving financial outcomes. | Looking ahead, Astral Resources NL’s future financial performance appears challenged. The company invested heavily as indicated by net cash from investing of AUD 7,168,021, up from AUD 5,606,676 in 2022, signaling ongoing capital expenditure or asset acquisition likely in mineral exploration and development. Net cash from financing also increased substantially to AUD 7,180,732, suggesting reliance on external funding to support investment and operations. Despite negative profitability, positive net cash from operations (AUD 1,871,148) indicates some cash flow sustainability. No dividends were paid in 2023 or 2022, consistent with loss-making status and reinvestment focus. Revenue concentration remains solely in Australia and in mineral exploration, indicating geographic and segment concentration risk. The large asset base growth and financing activity imply expectations of future growth, but current operational losses and low asset turnover raise concerns about near-term profitability. The company’s ability to convert investments into profitable operations will be critical for future performance. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The company's primary business model is mineral exploration and development, focusing on exploration and evaluation activities at its 100% owned Mandilla and Feysville Gold Projects in Western Australia. Revenue generation is currently limited, with reported other income of $24,063 in 2024, reflecting the company's stage as an explorer transitioning to a producer. The company funds its operations primarily through equity raisings, including share placements and share purchase plans, as it does not have ready access to credit facilities. The business strategy includes progressing exploration programs, advancing the Mandilla Scoping Study to a Pre-Feasibility Study level, and reviewing opportunities to enhance shareholder value. The company aims to transition from an explorer to a gold producer, with plans to develop a standalone gold mining operation at Mandilla, including a 2.5 Mtpa processing facility producing 80 to 100 koz per year. The company incurs exploration and evaluation expenditure and corporate overheads, with no significant revenue from product sales or services at this stage. | The company's primary business model is mineral exploration and development. It operates a single operating segment focused on exploration activities at its 100% owned Mandilla and Feysville Gold Projects in Australia. The company generates revenue primarily through interest income and occasional proceeds from disposal of exploration and evaluation assets, but it is currently in a development stage with no significant commodity sales revenue. The company funds its operations mainly through equity raisings, including share placements, entitlement offers, and share purchase plans, as it does not have ready access to credit facilities. It incurs exploration expenditure and corporate overheads, and its financial sustainability depends on securing capital from equity markets and managing cash flows accordingly. |

However, explicit market position details are not disclosed in the provided context. |


# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risk from changes in market prices including commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices that could affect income or the value of financial instruments. However, the Group currently has little or no exposure to commodity price risk as it is at an early development stage. The Company also faces risks related to exploration failure inherent in mineral exploration activities, with uncertainty about achieving business objectives. The Group's capital raising activities, including recent equity placements, are critical to funding operations and managing market conditions. There is a risk that additional funding may not be secured, which could require reducing exploration programs and dilute shareholder value. | The Group faces market risk from changes in market prices including commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices which can affect income or the value of financial instruments. The Group is currently at a development stage with little or no exposure to commodity price risk. The risk of exploration failure is inherent due to the uncertain nature of exploration activities, with no certainty that business objectives will be achieved. Additional capital requirements beyond current plans may require equity raisings which could dilute shareholdings, and there is no guarantee that suitable funding will be secured. The Group operates in a competitive mineral exploration industry in Australia and must respond to industry trends and customer behavior to achieve its strategic objectives. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include the inherent risks of exploration failure, with no certainty that exploration objectives will be achieved. Environmental risks arise from mechanised exploration activities that may cause land disturbance and waste disposal issues, potentially leading to delays, remediation costs, and legislative penalties. The Company has procedures to minimize environmental impacts but acknowledges that some risks cannot be fully mitigated. Compliance with Native Title and Heritage laws also presents operational risks, with some inherent risk that cannot be fully mitigated. The Group manages day-to-day operational challenges including maintaining business continuity and managing exploration programs. | Operational risks include the inherent risks of exploration failure, land disturbance, and disposal of waste products which could lead to delays, additional remediation costs, and legislative penalties. The Group's exploration properties may be subject to native title claims, sacred sites, or Aboriginal interests that could impose exploration or mining restrictions and claims for compensation. The Group has procedures to minimize environmental impacts but acknowledges that some environmental risks cannot be fully mitigated. Business continuity depends on successful exploration and development activities at key projects such as Mandilla and Feysville. The Group also faces risks related to day-to-day operations including managing commitments for minimum exploration expenditure and maintaining adequate operational resources. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk is low due to counterparties being reliable and cash invested only with major Australian financial institutions rated A+. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash reserves from capital raisings and monitoring cash flows to meet liabilities as they fall due. The Group had sufficient cash reserves at the reporting date and recently raised approximately $25 million through a two-tranche share placement to fund operations through to final investment decision (FID). Interest rate risk arises primarily from cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing liabilities, but the Group does not use derivatives to mitigate this risk. The Group's capital management focuses on maintaining liquidity to meet exploration and corporate overheads, with equity raisings as the primary funding source due to limited access to credit facilities. | Financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by investing cash only with major Australian financial institutions rated A+ and by dealing with reliable counterparties for receivables, which are considered low risk. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash reserves from capital raisings and monitoring cash flows to meet liabilities as they fall due. The Group had sufficient cash reserves at the reporting date and secured additional funding through a $3 million placement and a $1.6 million Share Purchase Plan post year-end. Interest rate risk arises primarily from cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing liabilities; however, the Group does not use derivatives to mitigate this risk and changes in interest rates are not expected to materially affect profit or equity. The Group's capital management focuses on maintaining liquidity to meet exploration and corporate overheads, with equity raisings as the primary funding source due to limited access to credit facilities. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks relate to adherence to environmental laws and regulations in Western Australia and at the federal level, including risks of land disturbance and waste disposal during exploration. The Company aims to comply fully with environmental legislation and has procedures to minimize environmental impacts and penalties. The Group is also subject to Native Title and Heritage laws, requiring adequate surveying and compliance before activities that disturb the environment. While the Company engages third parties to ensure compliance, some risks inherent in exploration activities cannot be fully mitigated. There were no known significant breaches of environmental requirements as of the report date. | Compliance risks relate to adherence to environmental regulations under Commonwealth and Western Australian laws, including managing land disturbance and waste disposal during exploration activities.

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces economic challenges primarily related to liquidity and capital requirements. The Company relies heavily on equity raisings as its primary source of funding due to limited access to credit facilities, which introduces uncertainty regarding the availability of future funding. Additional funding beyond current plans will require equity raises that may dilute shareholdings, and debt financing, if pursued, could be subject to restrictions. The Company may need to reduce the scope of future exploration programs to maintain sufficient capital. Market risks include fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices, which can affect income and financial instrument values, although the Group currently has little exposure to commodity price risk. Inflation and recession risks are not explicitly mentioned, but cost pressures are implied through increased corporate and compliance costs. The Group also faces environmental regulatory risks that could lead to additional costs or delays. Overall, economic uncertainties include the ability to secure additional funding, manage liquidity, and navigate market price volatility and regulatory compliance costs. | The Group faces economic challenges primarily related to liquidity and capital requirements. The Company relies heavily on equity raisings as its primary source of funding due to limited access to credit facilities, which introduces uncertainty regarding the availability of additional funding needed for exploration activities beyond current plans. This reliance on capital markets exposes the Group to risks of dilution of shareholdings and potential restrictions if debt financing is pursued. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining cash reserves and monitoring cash flows, but working capital was relatively low at $221,449 as of 30 June 2023, down from $1,453,754 the previous year, indicating tighter liquidity. Market risks include fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, although the Group currently has little exposure to commodity price risk. Inflationary pressures and cost increases are implied through rising employee benefits and corporate costs. Additionally, environmental regulations and rehabilitation provisions pose potential cost uncertainties.
