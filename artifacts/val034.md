# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Ramsay Health Care Limited's revenue showed a consistent upward trend from AUD 13,312.4 million in 2022 to AUD 14,963.9 million in 2023, and further to AUD 16,660.2 million in 2024, reflecting strong growth momentum. Gross margin, however, displayed an unusual pattern with an exceptionally high 191.00% in 2022, likely due to an anomaly in cost of goods sold data, then normalized to 68.62% in 2023 and improved to 71.68% in 2024, indicating better cost control relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service highlights that patient revenue dominates, increasing from AUD 12,666.1 million in 2022 to AUD 16,038.5 million in 2024, while ancillary services and rental revenue also grew modestly. Geographically, Australia and France are the largest contributors, with Australia increasing from AUD 5,711.0 million in 2023 to AUD 6,061.6 million in 2024, and France from AUD 5,017.1 million in 2022 to AUD 5,764.2 million in 2024, showing strong regional market presence and expansion, especially in Australia and the UK where revenue also rose significantly from AUD 1,321.5 million in 2022 to AUD 2,360.8 million in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a slight decline from 6.96% in 2023 to 6.03% in 2024 after improving from 2.54% in 2022, indicating some pressure on operating profitability despite revenue growth. Operating income increased from AUD 338.5 million in 2022 to AUD 1,004.6 million in 2024, but this growth was outpaced by revenue increases, leading to margin compression. Operating expenses rose substantially from a negative anomaly of -859.9 million in 2022 to AUD 10,956.6 million in 2024, reflecting increased cost base likely due to business expansion and inflationary pressures. The cost management challenge is evident as operating expenses grew faster than operating income, suggesting the need for tighter cost controls to sustain margin improvements. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted dramatically from a negative 29.58% in 2022 to positive rates of 34.43% in 2023 and 31.54% in 2024, indicating a reversal from tax benefits or credits in 2022 to normal tax expense levels in subsequent years, which impacted net profitability. Non-recurring items are not explicitly listed in the provided data, but the negative cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2022 suggest possible one-off accounting adjustments or COVID-related support impacts. External factors explicitly mentioned include revenue from governments under COVID support contracts in 2022 amounting to AUD 138.4 million, which was absent in later years, indicating a reduction in pandemic-related financial support that may have influenced profitability dynamics. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, Ramsay Health Care Limited's total assets slightly decreased to AUD 20,894.0 million from AUD 21,030.2 million in 2023, driven by a reduction in both current and non-current assets. Total liabilities also declined notably from AUD 16,207.0 million to AUD 15,366.5 million, with decreases in both current and non-current liabilities, indicating some deleveraging. Shareholders' equity increased significantly to AUD 5,527.5 million from AUD 4,823.2 million, supported by a rise in retained earnings to AUD 2,500.2 million. The current ratio decreased from 102.24% to 92.64%, suggesting a slight reduction in short-term liquidity but still close to parity. The debt to equity ratio improved markedly from 336.02% to 278.00%, reflecting a stronger capital structure with less reliance on debt relative to equity. Overall, the company shows a stable financial position with improved equity base and reduced leverage, though liquidity tightened somewhat. | In 2023, Ramsay Health Care Limited showed an increase in total assets to AUD 21,030.2 million from AUD 19,514.5 million in 2022, reflecting asset growth of approximately 7.8%. Current assets rose to AUD 3,895.8 million, supporting liquidity, while non-current assets increased to AUD 17,134.4 million. Total liabilities increased to AUD 16,207.0 million from AUD 14,988.3 million, driven by rises in both current liabilities (AUD 3,810.4 million) and non-current liabilities (AUD 12,396.6 million). Shareholders' equity improved moderately to AUD 4,823.2 million, up from AUD 4,526.2 million, indicating retained earnings growth and equity strengthening. The current ratio improved to 102.24% from 87.67%, suggesting better short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio slightly increased to 336.02% from 331.15%, indicating a stable but high leverage position. Overall, the company maintained a solid capital structure with increased assets and equity, improved liquidity, but continued reliance on significant debt financing. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Ramsay Health Care's revenue increased robustly by approximately 11.3% to AUD 16,660.2 million in 2024 from AUD 14,963.9 million in 2023, driven primarily by higher patient revenue across all geographic regions. Gross profit rose by 16.3% to AUD 11,942.3 million, improving the gross margin from 68.62% to 71.68%, indicating better cost control or pricing power at the gross level. However, operating income slightly declined to AUD 1,004.6 million from AUD 1,041.3 million, causing the operating margin to fall from 6.96% to 6.03%, reflecting increased operating expenses outpacing revenue growth. Net profit more than doubled to AUD 881.4 million from AUD 365.5 million, lifting the net profit margin from 2.44% to 5.29%, supported by a lower effective tax rate (31.54% vs. 34.43%) and despite higher interest expenses. Return on equity improved significantly to 17.03% from 7.82%, and return on assets increased to 4.20% from 1.80%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of capital. | Revenue increased by 12.4% to AUD 14,963.9 million in 2023 from AUD 13,312.4 million in 2022, driven primarily by higher patient revenue and geographic expansion. Gross profit surged to AUD 10,267.8 million from AUD 1,198.4 million, but this is inconsistent with the cost of goods sold figure (2023 COGS reported as 4,696.1 million, positive, which may indicate data anomaly). Operating income improved significantly to AUD 1,041.3 million from AUD 338.5 million, with operating margin rising to 6.96% from 2.54%, reflecting better operational control or revenue mix. However, net profit slightly declined to AUD 365.5 million from AUD 379.2 million, resulting in a net profit margin decrease to 2.44% from 2.85%. Return on equity was 7.82% and return on assets 1.80%, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and asset base. The effective tax rate increased to 34.43% from a negative 29.58% in 2022, impacting net earnings. Interest expense decreased substantially, improving interest coverage to 392.35% from a negative 87.02%, enhancing earnings quality and financial stability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, Ramsay Health Care maintained stable cash flow from operations, increasing slightly to AUD 1,292.8 million from AUD 1,279.6 million in 2023, supporting ongoing business activities. Asset turnover improved to 79.48% from 73.81%, reflecting more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Inventories decreased marginally, indicating effective inventory management. Despite revenue growth, operating expenses rose by 13.7% to AUD 10,956.6 million, which outpaced gross profit growth and contributed to a slight decline in operating income. Working capital dynamics show an increase in current liabilities to AUD 4,180.3 million from AUD 3,810.4 million, while current assets slightly decreased, contributing to a lower current ratio. Net cash from investing activities turned positive to AUD 159.7 million from a negative AUD 713.8 million, suggesting asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. However, net cash from financing activities showed a significant outflow of AUD 1,450.1 million compared to AUD 242.4 million outflow in 2023, possibly reflecting debt repayments or other financing adjustments. Dividends paid decreased to AUD 158.3 million from AUD 236.8 million, indicating a more conservative payout. | Operational efficiency showed mixed signals in 2023. Net cash from operations increased markedly to AUD 1,279.6 million from AUD 715.5 million, indicating improved cash generation from core activities. Inventories rose slightly to AUD 388.6 million, consistent with business growth. Asset turnover was high at 73.81%, suggesting effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses increased to AUD 9,631.8 million from a negative 859.9 million in 2022, which appears inconsistent and may reflect data irregularities; however, operating margin improvement suggests cost control relative to revenue growth. Working capital remained stable with current liabilities and current assets increasing proportionally, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, cash flow from operations and asset utilization indicate enhanced operational efficiency despite some data inconsistencies in expense reporting. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show mixed signals in 2024. The debt to equity ratio improved to 278.00% from 336.02%, indicating reduced leverage and potentially lower financial risk. However, the current ratio declined to 92.64% from 102.24%, suggesting tighter liquidity and a potential short-term risk in meeting current obligations. Interest expense increased to AUD 346.6 million from AUD 265.4 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased to 289.84% from 392.35%, indicating reduced but still comfortable ability to cover interest payments from operating income. The effective tax rate decreased to 31.54% from 34.43%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax regulations. The increase in current liabilities alongside a decrease in current assets warrants monitoring for liquidity stress. Overall, while leverage and tax burden improved, the company faces moderate liquidity pressure and higher interest costs that require attention. | Financial risk indicators show a stable but leveraged position. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly to 336.02%, indicating high leverage which could pose refinancing or interest rate risks. However, interest expense decreased and interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 392.35%, signaling strong ability to service debt from operating income. The current ratio improved to 102.24%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. The effective tax rate rose to 34.43% from a negative rate, which may reflect changes in tax policy or deferred tax adjustments, potentially impacting cash flows. The net cash from financing activities was negative AUD 242.4 million, less negative than 2022, indicating reduced external financing or debt repayments. Overall, while leverage remains high, improved interest coverage and liquidity mitigate immediate financial risks, but the company should monitor debt levels and tax impacts closely. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Ramsay Health Care's positive net cash from investing activities in 2024 suggests potential asset sales or reduced capital expenditure, which may impact future growth but improve short-term cash flow. The significant net cash outflow from financing activities, including lower dividends, indicates a focus on deleveraging or restructuring capital, which could strengthen the balance sheet but may limit shareholder returns in the near term. Revenue growth across all geographic regions, especially in patient services, signals continued demand and expansion opportunities. The improved asset turnover and profitability metrics support sustainable earnings growth. However, tighter liquidity and increased interest expenses highlight the need for prudent financial management. The company appears positioned for stable future performance with cautious investment and financing strategies balancing growth and risk. | Investment activity in 2023 was significant with net cash used in investing activities at negative AUD 713.8 million compared to a positive AUD 30.0 million in 2022, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from operations increased substantially, supporting cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments decreased to AUD 236.8 million from AUD 371.0 million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash for investments or debt reduction. Revenue growth was driven by patient services and geographic expansion, notably in Australia, UK, France, and Nordics, indicating diversified revenue streams and growth opportunities. The improved operating margin and cash flow generation support positive future performance, but the company should balance investment spending with maintaining financial flexibility. Overall, Ramsay Health Care appears positioned for continued growth with prudent cash flow management and strategic investments. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Ramsay Health Care Limited faces market risks including economic environment volatility, competition, demand fluctuations, and industry trends. Key market risks include limited growth or inability to maintain earnings, wage and supply cost inflation, energy price inflation, changes in interest rates, and impacts from government policy and regulation such as changes to private health insurance affordability and government funding arrangements. The company also faces risks from emerging competitors, changing stakeholder expectations, and societal demographic shifts such as aging populations increasing demand for healthcare services. Climate change and extreme weather events pose physical and transition risks affecting energy costs, supply chains, and service delivery. Ramsay mitigates these risks through proactive government and industry engagement, monitoring economic conditions, negotiating with health funds and governments for price adjustments, and developing sustainability and transition plans including decarbonisation strategies and energy efficiency initiatives. | Ramsay Health Care Limited faces market risks including changes in government or health insurance funding, reduction in private health insurance membership due to economic factors such as unemployment or inflation, increased competition from new digitally-enabled lower cost competitors, changing patient and doctor expectations, and industry disruption through innovation and acquisitions. External trends such as demographic changes (aging populations), growth in demand for mental health services, and increased payor sophistication also impact market conditions. The Group mitigates these risks by maintaining strong relationships with government and private health insurers, monitoring government policy and regulation, engaging in innovation and digital strategies, and conducting comprehensive due diligence on acquisitions and developments. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include workforce challenges such as attracting and retaining skilled employees, workplace health and safety, and potential operational disruptions from strikes or industrial actions. Supply chain risks arise from geopolitical tensions, sanctions, inflation, modern slavery risks, and severe weather impacting availability and cost of supplies. Cybersecurity risks involve potential breaches affecting patient privacy and operational systems. Clinical quality and safety risks include reputational damage and financial loss from medical malpractice or failure to maintain accreditation. Relationships with doctors, who are often not employees, pose risks to patient referrals and service delivery. Climate-related physical risks such as extreme weather, heatwaves, flooding, and wildfire exposure may disrupt operations and require facility upgrades. Ramsay addresses operational risks through comprehensive risk management frameworks, workplace safety policies, supplier relationship management, alternate supply arrangements, global cybersecurity frameworks aligned with NIST standards, investment in technology and infrastructure, clinical governance frameworks, and business continuity and recovery plans. | Operational risks include workforce shortages, particularly in nursing and clinical staff, which may impact capacity utilization and operational continuity. Supply chain risks arise from geopolitical tensions, economic conditions, international sanctions, inflation, and severe weather events that may disrupt availability and cost of supplies. The Group also faces risks related to cybersecurity incidents that could disrupt service delivery or cause privacy breaches. Climate change poses physical risks to facilities and operations, including extreme weather events impacting hospital operations. Ramsay manages these risks through workforce strategies to attract and retain talent, workplace health and safety frameworks, global procurement strategies with alternate supply arrangements, a Global Cybersecurity Framework with prevention, detection and recovery controls, business continuity plans, and climate vulnerability assessments with transition planning. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks primarily relate to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. Interest rate risk arises from variable rate debt; Ramsay manages this through interest rate swap contracts covering approximately 84% of variable base interest loans to reduce cash flow variability. Foreign exchange risk is managed via foreign currency swaps and forward contracts to hedge exposure from operating activities and expected purchases. Credit risk stems from potential counterparty defaults, mitigated by dealing only with prime financial institutions and creditworthy debtors such as governments and health funds, with ongoing monitoring and impairment provisions.
