# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company experienced consistent revenue growth from AUD 13,312.4 million in 2022 to AUD 14,963.9 million in 2023 (12.4% increase), and further to AUD 16,660.2 million in 2024 (11.3% increase from 2023). Despite this growth, the gross margin slightly declined from 195.75% in 2023 to 190.48% in 2024, indicating a marginal increase in cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Revenue is solely from contracts with customers, showing a clear focus on this revenue stream. Geographically, revenue increased across all reported regions from 2023 to 2024: Australia grew by 6.1% (from AUD 5,711.0m to AUD 6,061.6m), UK by 21.6% (AUD 1,941.2m to AUD 2,360.8m), France by 8.9% (AUD 5,291.2m to AUD 5,764.2m), and Nordics by 8.3% (AUD 2,395.7m to AUD 2,593.6m). The UK region showed the strongest growth rate, suggesting expanding market presence or demand there. The distribution remains diversified with Australia and France as the largest contributors, but the UK and Nordics are growing faster proportionally. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin data is unavailable, limiting direct analysis of operating efficiency. However, net profit margin improved significantly from 2.44% in 2023 to 5.29% in 2024, more than doubling, which suggests improved operational profitability or cost control. Operating income figures are missing, but the net profit increased from AUD 365.5 million in 2023 to AUD 881.4 million in 2024, a 141% increase, despite a relatively modest revenue growth of 11.3%. This indicates enhanced cost management or other income improvements. Cost of goods sold increased from AUD 14,327.8 million in 2023 to AUD 15,074.5 million in 2024, a 5.2% increase, which is lower than revenue growth, supporting the improved gross margin trend. Overall, the company appears to be managing costs effectively relative to revenue growth, driving higher profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 34.43% in 2023 to 31.54% in 2024, which contributed positively to net profit growth by reducing tax expenses relative to pre-tax income. Income tax expense decreased from AUD 181.5 million in 2023 to AUD 121.3 million in 2024, despite higher profits, indicating tax efficiency improvements or changes in tax regulations. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability are not detailed, but the improved tax rate and strong regional revenue growth, especially in the UK, may reflect favorable market or regulatory conditions. The absence of operating expense and income details limits deeper insight into one-off impacts. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a stable overall financial position with total assets slightly decreasing from AUD 21,030.2 million in 2023 to AUD 20,894.0 million. Total liabilities decreased notably from AUD 16,207.0 million to AUD 15,366.5 million, indicating effective liability management. Shareholders' equity improved significantly by 14.6% from AUD 4,823.2 million to AUD 5,527.5 million, supported by a strong increase in retained earnings from AUD 1,786.7 million to AUD 2,500.2 million. Current assets slightly decreased while current liabilities increased, causing the current ratio to decline from 102.24% to 92.64%, suggesting a modest reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved from 336.02% to 278.00%, reflecting a stronger capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet strength improved with better equity cushioning and controlled liabilities despite a small dip in total assets. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid overall financial position with total assets increasing from AUD 19,514.5 million in 2022 to AUD 21,030.2 million, reflecting asset growth of approximately 7.8%. Both current assets and non-current assets grew, indicating ongoing investment in operational and long-term resources.

Shareholders' equity improved from AUD 4,526.2 million to AUD 4,823.2 million, supporting a stronger equity base. The current ratio improved from 87.67% to 102.24%, indicating enhanced liquidity and better short-term financial health.

Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth in assets and equity with manageable increases in liabilities, supporting a stable financial foundation in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 11.3% from AUD 14,963.9 million in 2023 to AUD 16,660.2 million in 2024, demonstrating solid top-line growth. Despite a rise in cost of goods sold from AUD 14,327.8 million to AUD 15,074.5 million, the net profit more than doubled from AUD 365.5 million to AUD 881.4 million, resulting in a net profit margin improvement from 2.44% to 5.29%. Income before taxes decreased from AUD 527.1 million to AUD 384.6 million, and income tax expense declined from AUD 181.5 million to AUD 121.3 million, lowering the effective tax rate from 34.43% to 31.54%. The return on equity surged from 7.82% to 17.03%, and return on assets increased from 1.80% to 4.20%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and improved profitability sustainability. However, interest expense increased from AUD 514.2 million to AUD 620.0 million, which may pressure future earnings if not managed. | Revenue increased significantly by 12.4% from AUD 13,312.4 million in 2022 to AUD 14,963.9 million in 2023, indicating strong top-line growth. However, net profit slightly declined from AUD 379.2 million to AUD 365.5 million, a decrease of about 3.6%, which, combined with a rise in income tax expense from AUD 159.3 million to AUD 181.5 million, contributed to a lower net profit margin of 2.44% in 2023 compared to 2.85% in 2022. The gross margin reported for 2023 is unusually high at 195.75%, which may reflect accounting or classification nuances given the negative cost of goods sold figure. Return on equity was 7.82% and return on assets was 1.80%, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and asset bases. Income before taxes remained stable, slightly increasing from AUD 523.2 million to AUD 527.1 million. Overall, while revenue growth was robust, profitability margins and net earnings slightly declined, suggesting some pressure on earnings quality despite stable pre-tax income. |
| Operational efficiency | The asset turnover ratio improved from 73.81% in 2023 to 79.48% in 2024, indicating more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations remained stable, slightly increasing from AUD 1,279.6 million to AUD 1,292.8 million, supporting operational cash flow consistency. Inventories decreased marginally from AUD 388.6 million to AUD 379.4 million, suggesting effective inventory management. The current ratio declined to 92.64%, reflecting tighter working capital management but potentially reduced liquidity. Operating margin data is unavailable, limiting margin cost control analysis. Overall, operational efficiency improved through better asset utilization and steady cash flow generation despite some liquidity tightening. | Operational efficiency shows mixed signals in 2023. The asset turnover ratio is reported at 73.81%, indicating high revenue generation relative to asset base, which suggests effective asset utilization. Net cash from operations increased substantially from AUD 715.5 million in 2022 to AUD 1,279.6 million in 2023, reflecting improved cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased slightly from AUD 376.8 million to AUD 388.6 million, which is consistent with revenue growth and does not indicate inventory buildup risk. Operating margin data is unavailable, limiting margin cost control analysis. The increase in current assets and current liabilities was moderate, with the current ratio improving, which supports efficient working capital management. Overall, the company improved cash flow generation and asset utilization in 2023, indicating enhanced operational efficiency despite limited margin data. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage decreased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio falling from 336.02% to 278.00%, reducing financial risk. However, current liabilities increased from AUD 3,810.4 million to AUD 4,180.3 million, while current assets slightly decreased, lowering the current ratio to 92.64%, which may signal short-term liquidity risk. Interest expense rose by 20.5% to AUD 620.0 million, which could strain interest coverage, though this metric is unavailable. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, which may benefit net profitability. The combination of higher interest costs and reduced liquidity warrants monitoring for potential financial stress, but overall leverage reduction is a positive risk indicator. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show some areas of concern. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly to 336.02%, indicating a high leverage level that has marginally worsened compared to 2022. Interest expense is significant at AUD 514.2 million, but interest coverage ratio data is unavailable, limiting assessment of the company's ability to service debt from operating income. The effective tax rate increased from 30.45% to 34.43%, which may impact net profitability. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio rising above 1.0 to 102.24%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. The increase in non-current liabilities suggests growing long-term obligations. Overall, while liquidity improved, the high leverage and substantial interest expense highlight financial risk areas that require monitoring, especially given the lack of interest coverage data. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities shifted positively with net cash from investing turning from an outflow of AUD (713.8) million in 2023 to an inflow of AUD 159.7 million in 2024, indicating possible asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing showed a significant outflow increase from AUD (242.4) million to AUD (1,450.1) million, possibly reflecting debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends decreased from AUD (236.8) million to AUD (158.3) million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. Revenue growth across all geographic regions, notably Australia and the UK, supports positive market expansion trends. The stable operational cash flow and improved equity base provide a solid foundation for sustainable future performance, though increased financing outflows and interest expenses require careful cash flow management. | Investment activities in 2023 show a significant cash outflow from investing activities of AUD (713.8) million compared to a positive inflow of AUD 30.0 million in 2022, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities improved to an outflow of AUD (242.4) million from AUD (1,410.9) million in 2022, suggesting reduced debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends paid decreased from AUD (371.0) million to AUD (236.8) million, which may indicate a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. The net increase in cash of AUD 323.4 million in 2023 contrasts with a decrease in 2022, supporting better liquidity going forward. Revenue by geographic region shows strong contributions from Australia (AUD 5,711.0 million) and France (AUD 5,291.2 million), with meaningful revenue from the UK and Nordics, indicating diversified market exposure. These factors combined suggest the company is investing for growth while maintaining cash flow sustainability and managing dividend payouts prudently, positioning it for stable future financial performance. |
