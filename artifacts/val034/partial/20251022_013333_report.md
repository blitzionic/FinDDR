# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company experienced consistent revenue growth from 2022 to 2024, with revenue increasing from AUD 13,312.4 million in 2022 to AUD 14,963.9 million in 2023 (12.4% growth), and further to AUD 16,660.2 million in 2024 (11.3% growth). Gross margin remained relatively stable between 2023 and 2024 at approximately 77.7%, a slight increase from 77.63% in 2023, but significantly lower than the anomalous 191.23% in 2022, which likely reflects data irregularities given the negative COGS in 2022. Revenue by product/service is solely from contracts with customers, showing a clear upward trend consistent with total revenue growth. Geographically, revenue distribution shows growth across all regions from 2023 to 2024: Australia increased from AUD 5,711.0 million to AUD 6,061.6 million (+6.1%), UK from AUD 1,941.2 million to AUD 2,360.8 million (+21.6%), France from AUD 5,291.2 million to AUD 5,764.2 million (+8.9%), and Nordics from AUD 2,395.7 million to AUD 2,593.6 million (+8.3%). The UK region shows the highest growth rate, indicating a strong market expansion or increased sales effectiveness there. Overall, revenue growth is broad-based with stable gross margins, suggesting effective cost control at the direct cost level despite the unusual 2022 data. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a decline from 4.25% in 2023 to a very low 0.07% in 2024, despite a large increase in operating income from AUD 636.1 million in 2023 to AUD 12,273 million in 2024, which appears inconsistent and likely reflects data anomalies. Operating expenses increased modestly from AUD 610.7 million in 2023 to AUD 673.8 million in 2024 (+10.3%), which is reasonable relative to revenue growth (+11.3%). The operating income to revenue relationship is distorted by the data irregularities, but the net profit margin improved from 1.99% in 2023 to 5.33% in 2024, indicating better bottom-line profitability. Cost management appears effective at the operating expense level, with expenses growing slower than revenue, but the extremely low operating margin in 2024 suggests possible issues in other operating costs or accounting classifications. Overall, operating efficiency shows mixed signals due to data inconsistencies but suggests improved net profitability and controlled operating expenses. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 34.43% in 2023 to 31.54% in 2024, a slight decrease, but both years show a positive tax rate compared to a negative effective tax rate of -29.58% in 2022, indicating a tax benefit or loss carryback in 2022. Income tax expense rose from AUD 181.5 million in 2023 to AUD 121.3 million in 2024, consistent with higher profitability. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported, but the negative COGS and operating expenses in 2022 suggest one-off accounting adjustments or restatements that distort comparability. External factors affecting profitability are not detailed, but the tax rate normalization and improved net profit margin in 2024 imply a return to more typical operational conditions after prior year anomalies. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company maintained a strong financial position with total assets slightly decreasing from AUD 21,030.2 million in 2023 to AUD 20,894.0 million. Total liabilities decreased notably from AUD 16,207.0 million to AUD 15,366.5 million, reflecting effective liability management. Shareholders' equity improved significantly by 14.6% to AUD 5,527.5 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from AUD 1,786.7 million to AUD 2,500.2 million. Current assets remained stable at around AUD 3,872.8 million, while current liabilities increased to AUD 4,180.3 million, causing the current ratio to decline from 102.24% to 92.64%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved from 336.02% to 278.00%, showing a healthier capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a solid equity base, controlled liabilities, and stable asset levels, though liquidity has slightly tightened in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid overall financial position with total assets increasing from AUD 19,514.5 million in 2022 to AUD 21,030.2 million, reflecting asset growth of approximately 7.8%. Both current assets and non-current assets grew, indicating ongoing investment and asset base expansion. Total liabilities also increased from AUD 14,988.3 million to AUD 16,207.0 million, a rise of about 8.1%, with current liabilities slightly increasing and non-current liabilities growing more significantly. Shareholders' equity improved from AUD 4,526.2 million to AUD 4,823.2 million, supporting a stronger equity base. The current ratio improved from 87.67% to 102.24%, indicating enhanced liquidity and better short-term financial health. The debt to equity ratio slightly increased from 331.15% to 336.02%, suggesting a marginally higher leverage but still maintaining a consistent capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth in assets and equity with manageable increases in liabilities, supporting a stable financial foundation in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 11.3% to AUD 16,660.2 million in 2024, indicating strong top-line growth. Gross profit surged dramatically to AUD 12,946.8 million from AUD 1,536.9 million in 2023, which appears to be an anomaly given the cost of goods sold also increased modestly; however, the gross margin remained stable at approximately 77.7%. Operating income rose sharply to AUD 12,273 million from AUD 636.1 million, but the operating margin dropped significantly from 4.25% to 0.07%, suggesting a possible data inconsistency or extraordinary items affecting operating expenses. Net profit increased to AUD 888.7 million from AUD 298.1 million, improving the net profit margin from 1.99% to 5.33%, reflecting better bottom-line profitability. Return on equity more than doubled to 17.17%, and return on assets improved to 4.24%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate decreased slightly to 31.54%, supporting net profitability. Overall, profitability improved substantially with higher revenue and net income, though operating margin data suggests caution in interpretation. | Revenue increased by 12.4% from AUD 13,312.4 million in 2022 to AUD 14,963.9 million in 2023, indicating strong top-line growth. Gross profit rose from AUD 1,167.8 million to AUD 1,536.9 million, improving gross margin from an unusually high 191.23% in 2022 to a more sustainable 77.63% in 2023, suggesting a normalization or correction in cost of goods sold reporting. Operating income more than doubled from AUD 298.4 million to AUD 636.1 million, with operating margin improving from 2.24% to 4.25%, reflecting better cost control or operational leverage. However, net profit declined from AUD 379.2 million to AUD 298.1 million, causing net profit margin to decrease from 2.85% to 1.99%. This decline is influenced by a higher effective tax rate rising from a negative 29.58% in 2022 to 34.43% in 2023 and increased income tax expense. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 6.38% and 1.47% respectively, indicating moderate profitability and earnings sustainability. Overall, while revenue and operating profitability improved, net profitability was pressured by tax and interest expenses, affecting earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased moderately from AUD 610.7 million to AUD 673.8 million, which is controlled relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover improved from 73.81% to 79.48%, indicating more efficient use of assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations increased slightly to AUD 1,292.8 million, supporting operational cash flow stability. Inventories decreased marginally to AUD 379.4 million, suggesting effective inventory management. Despite a slight decline in the current ratio, working capital appears sufficient to support operations. The operating margin's sharp decline to 0.07% contrasts with improved net margins, which may indicate non-operating income or cost structure changes. Overall, operational efficiency shows positive trends in asset utilization and cash flow, with controlled cost increases relative to revenue. | The company improved operational efficiency in 2023 as evidenced by the operating margin increasing to 4.25% from 2.24% in 2022, indicating better cost control and expense management. The asset turnover ratio was 73.81%, showing effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased significantly from AUD 715.5 million to AUD 1,279.6 million, reflecting strong cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased slightly from AUD 376.8 million to AUD 388.6 million, which is consistent with revenue growth and does not indicate overstocking. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supported by the current ratio rising to 102.24%. These factors collectively suggest enhanced operational efficiency and effective management of working capital and cash flows in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage decreased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio falling from 336.02% to 278.00%, reducing financial risk. However, current liabilities increased, and the current ratio declined to 92.64%, indicating tighter liquidity. Interest expense rose from AUD 265.4 million to AUD 346.6 million, while income before taxes decreased to AUD 384.6 million from AUD 527.1 million, resulting in a sharp drop in interest coverage ratio from 239.68% to 3.54%, signaling increased difficulty in covering interest obligations from operating earnings. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, which marginally reduces tax-related risk. The combination of higher interest expense and lower income before taxes suggests elevated financial risk and potential early warning signs regarding debt servicing capacity despite improved leverage ratios. | Leverage remained high with the debt to equity ratio slightly increasing to 336.02% in 2023 from 331.15% in 2022, indicating continued reliance on debt financing. However, interest coverage improved dramatically from a negative (76.71%) in 2022 to a positive 239.68% in 2023, suggesting a significant reduction in interest expense burden relative to operating income and a much stronger ability to meet interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased substantially to 34.43% from a negative rate in 2022, which may indicate changes in tax policy or adjustments that could impact net profitability. Liquidity improved as shown by the current ratio exceeding 1 at 102.24%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. Overall, while leverage remains elevated, improved interest coverage and liquidity ratios reduce immediate financial risk, but the higher tax rate and sustained high debt levels warrant monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities shifted positively with net cash from investing turning from an outflow of AUD (713.8) million in 2023 to an inflow of AUD 159.7 million in 2024, indicating possible asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing showed a significant outflow of AUD (1,450.1) million compared to AUD (242.4) million previously, which may reflect debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends decreased to AUD (158.3) million from AUD (236.8) million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy. Revenue growth across all geographic regions—Australia, UK, France, and Nordics—indicates broad-based market expansion, supporting future growth prospects. The stable operational cash flow and improved equity position provide a solid foundation for sustainable financial performance. However, the reduced liquidity and interest coverage warrant monitoring. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued growth with prudent investment and financing strategies in 2024. | Investment activities in 2023 show a significant cash outflow from investing activities of AUD (713.8) million compared to a positive AUD 30.0 million in 2022, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities was an outflow of AUD (242.4) million, less negative than 2022's (1,410.9) million, suggesting reduced debt repayment or dividend payments. Dividends paid decreased from AUD (371.0) million to AUD (236.8) million, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. The company’s revenue by geographic region in 2023 shows diversified income streams with Australia (AUD 5,711.0 million), France (AUD 5,291.2 million), UK (AUD 1,941.2 million), and Nordics (AUD 2,395.7 million), supporting geographic diversification and growth potential. The strong operational cash flow and ongoing investments suggest sustainable cash flow generation and potential for future growth, though the company should balance investment with maintaining financial flexibility. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Group faces market risks including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, and liquidity risk. Interest rate risk arises from fluctuations in market interest rates affecting the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments, primarily long-term debt with floating rates. Foreign exchange risk relates to changes in currency rates impacting operating activities and financial instruments. Macroeconomic factors such as wage, supply cost, and energy price inflation, as well as changes in interest rates, can materially impact financial performance. Competition, innovation, and industry disruption may affect growth strategy. Changes in government policy and regulation, including funding arrangements and private health insurance affordability, pose risks. Climate change and extreme weather events may disrupt operations and supply chains, impacting costs and service delivery. Customer expectations and payor sophistication also influence market dynamics. The Group mitigates these risks through hedging strategies (interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts), monitoring economic conditions, maintaining strong relationships with payors and governments, and developing transition plans for sustainability and climate resilience. | The Group faces market risks including changes in government or health insurance funding, reductions in private health insurance membership due to economic factors such as unemployment or inflation, and increased competition from new digitally-enabled lower cost competitors. External trends such as demographic changes (aging population), changing patient and doctor expectations, technological change including digitisation, clinical innovation, and increased payor sophistication also impact demand and competitive positioning. Macroeconomic risks include inflationary pressures on wages, supply costs, and energy prices, as well as interest rate changes affecting costs. The Group mitigates these risks through ongoing monitoring of government policy and regulation, maintaining strong relationships with funders, investing in innovation and facilities, and engaging in proactive dialogue with stakeholders. The Group also undertakes comprehensive due diligence for acquisitions and developments to manage risks related to competition and industry disruption. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include workforce challenges such as attracting and retaining talent, workplace safety, and potential industrial actions. Supply chain risks arise from geopolitical tensions, sanctions, inflation, modern slavery risks, and climate-related disruptions like severe weather. Cybersecurity risks involve potential breaches affecting information systems and patient privacy. Business continuity risks stem from pandemics, extreme weather, and other disruptions. Clinical quality and safety risks include reputational damage and financial loss from medical malpractice or accreditation failures. Relationships with doctors impact patient referrals and service quality. The Group addresses these risks through comprehensive clinical governance frameworks, workplace health and safety policies, global cybersecurity frameworks aligned with NIST standards, supplier relationship management, alternate supply arrangements, and business continuity planning. Investments in technology, infrastructure, and innovation support operational resilience. | Operational risks include workforce shortages, particularly in nursing and clinical staff, which impact capacity utilisation and service delivery.
