# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Ramsay Health Care Limited's revenue showed a consistent upward trend from AUD 13,312.4 million in 2022 to AUD 14,963.9 million in 2023, reaching AUD 16,660.2 million in 2024. Correspondingly, the gross profit increased from AUD 10,204.6 million in 2022 to AUD 11,616.2 million in 2023 and further to AUD 12,946.8 million in 2024, with gross margin slightly improving from 76.65% in 2022 to 77.63% in 2023 and 77.71% in 2024, indicating stable cost control relative to revenue growth. Revenue by product/service shifted focus with 2024 showing AUD 16,660.2 million from contracts with customers dominating, while other income sources like government grants and sale of development assets decreased compared to 2023. Geographically, revenue expanded across all regions with Australia growing from AUD 5,711.0 million in 2023 to AUD 6,061.6 million in 2024, UK from AUD 1,941.2 million to AUD 2,360.8 million, France from AUD 5,291.2 million to AUD 5,764.2 million, and Nordics from AUD 2,395.7 million to AUD 2,593.6 million, reflecting broad-based regional growth. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed a slight decline from 6.85% in 2022 to 6.69% in 2023 and further to 5.99% in 2024, despite revenue growth, indicating some pressure on operating profitability. Operating income remained relatively flat at AUD 912.2 million in 2022, AUD 1,001.4 million in 2023, and slightly decreased to AUD 997.6 million in 2024, while revenue increased significantly, suggesting rising operating expenses. Operating expenses surged from AUD 4,603.6 million in 2022 to AUD 9,279.4 million in 2023 and further to AUD 10,261.1 million in 2024, more than doubling from 2022 to 2024, which points to increased cost pressures or investments that have not yet translated into proportional operating income growth. This cost escalation is a key factor in the declining operating margin despite strong revenue and gross profit growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 30.45% in 2022 to 34.43% in 2023 before decreasing to 31.54% in 2024, which impacted net profitability. Net profit margin improved from 2.85% in 2022 to 2.44% in 2023 and then significantly to 5.29% in 2024, driven by a substantial increase in net profit from AUD 379.2 million in 2022 and AUD 365.5 million in 2023 to AUD 881.4 million in 2024, despite the tax rate fluctuations. Non-recurring items are implied in the other income categories such as government grants and net profit on disposal of non-current assets and acquisitions, which notably decreased from AUD 290.2 million in government grants in 2023 to AUD 99.6 million in 2024, and net profit on disposal dropped from AUD 60.3 million in 2023 to AUD 7.1 million in 2024, indicating less one-off income contributing to 2024 results. No explicit external factors affecting profitability beyond these items are listed. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, Ramsay Health Care Limited's total assets slightly decreased to AUD 20,894.0 million from AUD 21,030.2 million in 2023, driven by a reduction in both current and non-current assets. Total liabilities also declined notably from AUD 16,207.0 million to AUD 15,366.5 million, with a sharper decrease in non-current liabilities (from AUD 12,396.6 million to AUD 11,186.2 million) despite an increase in current liabilities (from AUD 3,810.4 million to AUD 4,180.3 million). Shareholders' equity improved significantly by 14.6% to AUD 5,527.5 million, supported by a rise in retained earnings to AUD 2,500.2 million. The current ratio decreased to 92.64% from 102.24%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved markedly from 336.02% to 278.00%, reflecting a healthier capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company shows a stable financial position with improved equity base and reduced leverage, though liquidity tightened somewhat in 2024. | In 2023, Ramsay Health Care Limited demonstrated growth in total assets, increasing from AUD 19,514.5 million in 2022 to AUD 21,030.2 million, driven by rises in both current assets (from AUD 3,285.5 million to AUD 3,895.8 million) and non-current assets (from AUD 16,229.0 million to AUD 17,134.4 million). Total liabilities also increased from AUD 14,988.3 million to AUD 16,207.0 million, with current liabilities slightly rising and non-current liabilities growing more significantly. Shareholders' equity improved notably by approximately 22.7%, from AUD 3,933.5 million to AUD 4,823.2 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings. The current ratio improved from 0.88 to 1.02, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 381.04% to 336.02%, reflecting a modest reduction in leverage and a stronger equity base. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 shows asset growth, improved liquidity, and a more balanced capital structure, though liabilities remain substantial relative to equity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Ramsay Health Care's revenue increased by 11.3% to AUD 16,660.2 million in 2024, driven by growth across all geographic regions, notably the UK (+21.6%) and Australia (+6.2%). Gross profit rose by 11.5% to AUD 12,946.8 million, maintaining a stable gross margin of 77.71%, slightly up from 77.63% in 2023. Operating income remained nearly flat at AUD 997.6 million, causing the operating margin to decline from 6.69% to 5.99%. Despite this, net profit more than doubled to AUD 881.4 million, lifting the net profit margin to 5.29% from 2.44%, supported by a lower effective tax rate (31.54% vs. 34.43%) and a significant reduction in income tax expense. Return on equity surged to 17.03% from 8.35%, and return on assets improved to 4.20% from 1.80%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. However, income before taxes decreased, and interest expense increased, suggesting some pressure on pre-tax profitability. | Revenue increased by 12.4% from AUD 13,312.4 million in 2022 to AUD 14,963.9 million in 2023, driven by growth across all geographic regions, notably Australia and the UK. Gross profit rose by 13.9% to AUD 11,616.2 million, improving the gross margin from 76.65% to 77.63%, indicating effective cost of goods sold management relative to revenue. However, operating expenses doubled from AUD 4,603.6 million to AUD 9,279.4 million, which compressed the operating margin slightly from 6.85% to 6.69%. Operating income increased modestly to AUD 1,001.4 million. Net profit declined marginally by 3.6% to AUD 365.5 million, with net profit margin decreasing from 2.85% to 2.44%. The effective tax rate increased from 30.45% to 34.43%, negatively impacting net earnings. Return on equity and assets were 8.35% and 1.80% respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to invested capital and assets. Earnings quality appears pressured by rising operating expenses and higher tax burden despite revenue growth. |
| Operational efficiency | Operationally, Ramsay Health Care showed moderate improvement in asset utilization with asset turnover increasing to 79.48% from 73.81%, reflecting better revenue generation from assets. Cost of goods sold rose in line with revenue, maintaining gross margin stability. Operating expenses increased by 10.6% to AUD 10,261.1 million, slightly outpacing revenue growth, which contributed to a marginal decline in operating income. Net cash from operations increased slightly to AUD 1,292.8 million, supporting operational cash flow stability. Inventories decreased marginally, indicating effective inventory management. Working capital dynamics show an increase in current liabilities against a slight decrease in current assets, which may pressure short-term operational liquidity. Overall, the company maintained solid operational efficiency with improved asset turnover and stable cash flow from operations despite rising costs. | Operational efficiency shows mixed results in 2023. The company increased revenue significantly, with an asset turnover ratio of 0.7381 indicating efficient use of assets to generate sales. However, operating expenses surged disproportionately, more than doubling, which suggests challenges in cost control. Inventories increased slightly, consistent with higher operations. Net cash from operations improved substantially from AUD 715.5 million to AUD 1,279.6 million, reflecting stronger cash generation from core activities. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supporting liquidity. Despite strong operational cash flow, net cash from investing activities was negative at AUD (713.8) million, indicating significant investment outflows. Net cash from financing activities was negative but reduced in magnitude compared to 2022, with dividends paid decreasing from AUD (371.0) million to AUD (218.7) million. Overall, while cash flow from operations and asset utilization improved, cost control remains a concern given the sharp rise in operating expenses. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators reveal mixed signals in 2024. The debt to equity ratio improved significantly to 278.00% from 336.02%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. However, the current ratio declined to 92.64% from 102.24%, suggesting tighter liquidity and potential short-term solvency concerns. Interest expense increased by 20.6% to AUD 620.0 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased to 160.90% from 194.75%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest obligations from operating income. The effective tax rate decreased to 31.54%, which may positively impact net profitability but also indicates tax environment changes. The increase in current liabilities alongside reduced current assets warrants monitoring for liquidity risk. Overall, while leverage risk has diminished, liquidity and interest coverage metrics suggest moderate financial risk that requires attention. | Financial risk indicators reveal some areas of concern in 2023. Although the debt to equity ratio improved to 336.02% from 381.04%, the company remains highly leveraged. Interest expense increased significantly from AUD 389.0 million to AUD 514.2 million, while interest coverage ratio declined from 234.50% to 194.75%, indicating reduced ability to cover interest costs from operating income. The effective tax rate rose to 34.43%, increasing the tax burden. Current ratio improved to above 1.0, reducing short-term liquidity risk. The increase in non-current liabilities and higher interest expense suggest elevated financial risk, particularly if operating income growth does not keep pace. The modest decline in net profit and compressed margins further highlight potential earnings volatility. Overall, leverage and interest cost pressures warrant monitoring as early warning signs. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Ramsay Health Care's net cash from investing turned positive to AUD 159.7 million from a negative AUD 713.8 million in 2023, indicating reduced capital expenditure or asset sales that may support cash flow sustainability. Net cash from financing surged to AUD 1,450.1 million from a negative AUD 242.4 million, possibly reflecting new debt or equity financing, which could fund growth or restructure liabilities. Dividends paid decreased to AUD 134.9 million from AUD 218.7 million, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy to preserve cash. Revenue growth across all geographic segments, especially the UK and Australia, signals positive market expansion. The stable operational cash flow and improved equity base support future financial stability. However, increased interest expenses and tighter liquidity highlight the need for prudent financial management. Overall, the company appears positioned for sustainable growth with cautious investment and financing strategies. | Looking ahead, Ramsay Health Care’s substantial investment outflows in 2023 (net cash from investing at AUD (713.8) million) suggest ongoing capital expenditure or acquisitions that may support future growth. The strong net cash from operations (AUD 1,279.6 million) indicates cash flow sustainability to fund these investments and reduce reliance on external financing, as net cash from financing outflows decreased. Dividend payments were reduced, possibly reflecting a more conservative payout policy to preserve cash. Geographic revenue growth in Australia, UK, France, and Nordics points to diversified market expansion. The increase in other income from government grants and asset disposals may provide additional non-operating cash sources. However, rising operating expenses and financial leverage could constrain future profitability. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued growth supported by operational cash flow and investments, but cost management and financial risk mitigation will be critical to sustaining performance. |

Credit risk relates to potential counterparty default on financial assets, mitigated by dealing only with prime financial institutions with high credit ratings and monitoring credit exposures. Liquidity risk involves the ability to meet financial liabilities as they fall due, managed by maintaining a balance between funding continuity and flexibility through bank overdrafts, loans, bonds, and leases, with ongoing cash flow forecasting and management reporting. Capital structure risks include constrained capacity to execute strategy, increased funding costs, and reduced availability of funding, mitigated by a capital management plan ensuring a strong balance sheet, diverse capital sources, and Treasury policies for risk management. Hedging instruments are accounted for under strict criteria to manage fair value and cash flow risks. Sensitivity analyses are performed for interest rate and foreign currency movements to assess impacts on profit and equity. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks relate to regulatory compliance, legal requirements, and environmental regulations.
