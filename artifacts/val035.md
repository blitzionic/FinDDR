## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Inflation and rising interest rates have increased some costs in all markets including wages and salaries.

We are looking forward to launching multiple variants of NovoSorb MTX, including a particulate variant that will drive its adoption as a soft tissue reconstruction platform of choice for clinicians. | The biotechnology sector is highly volatile, significantly driven by market sentiment and inherently high risk. Companies such as PolyNovo are dependent on the success of their research projects and their ability to attract funding to support these activities. The Group faces competition from both existing industry participants and new disruptive market entrants, which may challenge its market position. Additionally, the rapid advancements in technology pose a risk to maintaining competitive advantage. |
