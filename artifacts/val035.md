# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 saw a significant increase from $41,890.603 to $66,535.017, representing a growth of approximately 58.9%. The growth continued into 2024, with revenue reaching $104,763, marking an increase of about 57.3% from 2023. The gross margin data is not available, but the net profit margin improved from 2.85% in 2022 to 7.40% in 2023, and further to 5.02% in 2024, indicating a fluctuating profitability despite increasing revenues. In terms of product revenue, commercial product sales rose from $59,578,531 in 2023 to $92,042,000 in 2024, while BARDA revenue increased from $5,662,938 to $11,150,000 in the same period. Geographically, revenue from the United States increased from $51,763,960 in 2023 to $79,836,000 in 2024, while Australia and New Zealand saw growth from $4,769,010 to $6,560,000, and other countries increased from $8,708,499 to $16,796,000, indicating a strong performance in the U.S. market and growth in international regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin data is not available, but the relationship between operating income and revenue can be inferred from net profit trends. The company reported a net profit of -$1,192.532 in 2022, which improved to -$4,924.539 in 2023, and then turned positive with a net profit of $5,261 in 2024. This indicates a significant turnaround in operational performance, suggesting improved cost management and operational efficiency despite the lack of specific operating margin figures. The increase in revenue alongside the reduction in net losses and eventual profitability suggests that the company is effectively managing its costs relative to its revenue growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate saw a dramatic increase from 3.62% in 2022 to 0.17% in 2023, and then spiked to 207.48% in 2024, indicating potential one-off tax adjustments or unusual tax circumstances affecting profitability. The income tax expense shifted from $41.608 in 2022 to $8.559 in 2023, and then to -$3,550 in 2024, which may reflect tax credits or adjustments related to prior periods. These fluctuations in the effective tax rate and income tax expense could significantly impact net profit figures, particularly the substantial negative tax expense in 2024, which may require further investigation to understand its implications on overall profitability. |

The positive net cash from operations indicates improved cash flow sustainability. Future investment activities should focus on expanding market presence and enhancing operational efficiency to maintain profitability. The company may consider a dividend policy as profitability stabilizes. | In 2023, the company faced significant challenges, with a net loss and negative cash flow from operations.
