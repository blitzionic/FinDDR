# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue showed a sharp decline from 41,890,603 AUD in 2022 to 66,535,017 AUD in 2023, then a drastic drop to 104,763 AUD in 2024, indicating a severe contraction in sales in 2024. Despite this, gross margin percentages remained consistently above 100% across all years (2022: 105.26%, 2023: 106.66%, 2024: 105.23%), suggesting cost of goods sold was reported as negative or there were accounting anomalies, as gross profit figures are not provided. Revenue by product/service in 2024 was dominated by commercial product sales at 92,042,000 AUD, with BARDA revenue at 11,150,000 AUD, both showing growth compared to 2023 (59,578,531 AUD and 5,662,938 AUD respectively), which conflicts with the overall revenue drop, indicating possible data inconsistency or reclassification. Geographically, the United States remained the largest market, increasing from 51,763,960 AUD in 2023 to 79,836,000 AUD in 2024, with Australia and New Zealand and other countries also showing growth, suggesting a shift towards stronger international sales despite overall revenue decline. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin data is unavailable for all years, limiting direct margin trend analysis. Operating expenses in 2024 were 94,852 AUD, significantly lower than 66,320,456 AUD in 2023, aligning with the revenue drop, indicating cost cutting or scale reduction. The relationship between operating income and revenue cannot be fully assessed due to missing operating income figures. Cost management appears to have been aggressive in 2024, with operating expenses drastically reduced, but the net profit margin improved to 5.02% in 2024 from negative margins in prior years (2023: -7.40%, 2022: -2.85%), indicating improved operational efficiency or one-off effects despite the revenue collapse. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed extreme volatility: 3.62% in 2022, near zero at -0.17% in 2023, and a highly negative -207.48% in 2024, reflecting unusual tax benefits or adjustments in 2024. Income tax expense swung from a positive 8,559 AUD in 2023 to a negative (3,550) AUD in 2024, contributing to net profit turnaround. Non-recurring items are not explicitly detailed but the large swings in tax and net profit margins suggest significant one-off impacts or accounting adjustments. External factors affecting profitability likely include the drastic revenue decline and cost structure changes, possibly due to market conditions or strategic shifts, but no explicit external events are provided. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a significantly smaller scale of reported figures compared to 2023, with total assets at AUD 108,720 thousand versus AUD 92,620,649 thousand in 2023, indicating a drastic reduction in asset base. Current assets decreased to AUD 79,295 thousand from AUD 67,354,225 thousand, while non-current assets also declined to AUD 29,425 thousand from AUD 25,266,424 thousand. Total liabilities decreased to AUD 36,596 thousand from AUD 27,237,507 thousand, with current liabilities at AUD 23,247 thousand and non-current liabilities at AUD 13,349 thousand. Shareholders' equity stands at AUD 72,124 thousand, up from AUD 65,383,142 thousand in 2023, reflecting a relative improvement in equity position despite the overall scale reduction. The current ratio decreased from 531.72% in 2023 to 341.10% in 2024, indicating a decline in liquidity but still a strong current asset coverage of current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio increased from 41.66% to 50.74%, suggesting a higher leverage level relative to equity. Overall, the financial position in 2024 is on a much smaller scale but shows a relatively balanced capital structure with moderate leverage and strong liquidity, albeit reduced from the prior year. | In 2023, the company demonstrated significant asset growth with total assets increasing from AUD 55,376,482 thousand in 2022 to AUD 92,620,649 thousand, reflecting a strong expansion in asset base. Current assets saw a substantial rise to AUD 67,354,225 thousand from AUD 16,189,509 thousand, indicating improved liquidity. Non-current assets also increased to AUD 25,266,424 thousand from AUD 18,782,021 thousand, showing ongoing investment in long-term resources. Total liabilities increased to AUD 27,237,507 thousand from AUD 17,256,444 thousand, but the growth in shareholders' equity was more pronounced, rising to AUD 65,383,142 thousand from AUD 17,715,086 thousand, which strengthened the equity position considerably. The current ratio improved markedly to 531.72% from 208.73%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 41.66% from 97.41%, reflecting a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the balance sheet strength improved with robust asset growth, controlled liability expansion, and a strong equity base supporting financial health in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company’s revenue in 2024 is AUD 104,763 thousand, a substantial decrease from AUD 66,535,017 thousand in 2023, indicating a major contraction in reported revenue scale. Cost of goods sold is AUD 5,479 thousand, higher proportionally relative to revenue compared to 2023. Gross profit and operating income are not available for 2024, limiting margin analysis. However, net profit turned positive at AUD 5,261 thousand in 2024 compared to a net loss of AUD (4,924,539) thousand in 2023, reflecting a significant improvement in earnings quality and profitability. The net profit margin improved from a negative (7.40%) in 2023 to a positive 5.02% in 2024. Return on equity improved from a negative (11.85%) to a marginally positive 0.02%, and return on assets improved from (6.65%) to 0.01%, indicating a shift from losses to slight profitability but on a much smaller asset base. The effective tax rate is negative at (207.48%) in 2024, reflecting a tax benefit or adjustments impacting net income positively. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved markedly in 2024 despite the smaller scale of operations. | Revenue increased significantly by approximately 59% from AUD 41,890,603 thousand in 2022 to AUD 66,535,017 thousand in 2023, driven by commercial product sales and BARDA revenue. Despite this revenue growth, the company reported a net loss of AUD 4,924,539 thousand in 2023, which worsened compared to a net loss of AUD 1,192,532 thousand in 2022. The net profit margin deteriorated from -2.85% to -7.40%, indicating that profitability did not keep pace with revenue growth. Gross margin slightly improved to 106.66% from 105.26%, suggesting stable cost of goods sold relative to revenue. However, operating expenses were very high at AUD 66,320,456 thousand, nearly matching revenue, which likely contributed to the net loss. Return on equity was negative at -11.85% and return on assets was also negative at -6.65%, reflecting poor earnings quality and lack of profitability sustainability in 2023. The effective tax rate turned negative to -0.17% from 3.62%, influenced by a small income tax benefit despite losses. Overall, earnings quality remains weak despite revenue growth, with losses deepening and margins under pressure. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses in 2024 are AUD 94,852 thousand, which is a much smaller absolute figure compared to AUD 66,320,456 thousand in 2023, consistent with the reduced scale of operations. Operating margin data is unavailable, but the net profit margin of 5.02% suggests some operational efficiency gains. Asset turnover dropped sharply from 89.91% in 2023 to 0.23% in 2024, indicating a significant decline in revenue generated per unit of asset, likely due to the large reduction in asset base and revenue scale. Net cash from operations turned positive at AUD 3,683 thousand in 2024 compared to a negative cash flow of AUD (6,612,528) thousand in 2023, showing improved cash generation from core operations. Working capital remains strong given the current ratio of 341.10%, though it is lower than the prior year. Overall, operational efficiency appears improved in terms of cash flow and profitability, but asset utilization has deteriorated significantly. | The company’s operational efficiency in 2023 shows mixed signals. The asset turnover ratio was very high at 89.91, indicating strong revenue generation relative to asset base, which is a positive sign of asset utilization. However, operating expenses were extremely high at AUD 66,320,456 thousand, nearly equal to revenue, which suggests poor cost control and low operating margin, although exact operating margin data is unavailable. Net cash from operations was negative at AUD (6,612,528) thousand, worsening from a negative AUD (2,057,034) thousand in 2022, indicating operational cash flow challenges and potential working capital inefficiencies. Inventories increased to AUD 4,530,285 thousand from AUD 2,535,293 thousand, which may indicate buildup of stock or slower inventory turnover. Overall, while asset utilization appears strong, cost control and cash flow from operations are areas of concern for operational efficiency in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased in 2024 with the debt to equity ratio rising to 50.74% from 41.66% in 2023, indicating higher financial risk relative to equity. Liquidity remains strong with a current ratio of 341.10%, though it declined from 531.72% in 2023, suggesting some reduction in short-term liquidity buffer. Interest expense is minimal at AUD (721) thousand in 2024 compared to AUD (714,163) thousand in 2023, reflecting lower debt levels or interest rates. Interest coverage ratio is not available, limiting assessment of ability to service debt from operating income. The effective tax rate is highly negative at (207.48%), which may indicate tax credits or adjustments but also introduces volatility risk in earnings. Overall, financial risk is moderate with increased leverage but strong liquidity and improved earnings, though the negative tax rate and lack of interest coverage data warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show some improvement in leverage but ongoing liquidity and profitability risks. The debt to equity ratio decreased significantly to 41.66% from 97.41%, indicating reduced financial leverage and lower risk from debt burden. The current ratio improved substantially to 531.72% from 208.73%, suggesting strong short-term liquidity and ability to cover current liabilities. Interest expense increased to AUD (714,163) thousand from AUD (315,366) thousand, which may pressure earnings given the negative operating results, but interest coverage ratio data is unavailable to fully assess coverage risk. The effective tax rate turned negative to -0.17%, reflecting tax benefits from losses but also signaling volatile tax expense. Negative net profits and negative returns on equity and assets highlight earnings risk and sustainability concerns. Overall, leverage and liquidity risks have improved, but profitability and cash flow risks remain significant financial risk factors in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show net cash used in investing of AUD (1,490) thousand in 2024, a reduction from AUD (848,768) thousand in 2023, indicating lower capital expenditure or asset purchases. Net cash from financing is negative at AUD (3,170) thousand in 2024 compared to a large positive inflow in 2023, suggesting reduced external financing or debt repayment. The net decrease in cash of AUD (977) thousand in 2024 contrasts with a large increase in 2023, indicating tighter cash flow management. No dividend data is available for 2024. Revenue by product/service shows growth in commercial product sales to AUD 92,042,000 and BARDA revenue to AUD 11,150,000, both higher than 2023, indicating positive market or segment trends. Geographic revenue also increased across all regions, with the United States revenue rising to AUD 79,836,000, Australia and New Zealand to AUD 6,560,000, and other countries to AUD 16,796,000, suggesting geographic expansion or stronger sales performance. Overall, future financial performance appears supported by improved revenue streams and controlled investment, but cash flow sustainability and financing strategies should be closely managed. | Investment activities in 2023 show a shift with net cash from investing turning negative at AUD (848,768) thousand compared to a positive AUD 5,858,471 thousand in 2022, indicating increased investment outflows or reduced asset sales. Net cash from financing was strongly positive at AUD 48,064,381 thousand versus a negative AUD (5,388,314) thousand in 2022, suggesting significant capital raising or financing inflows supporting growth. The large net increase in cash of AUD 40,603,085 thousand reflects strong financing inflows and improved liquidity. No dividend payments were reported, consistent with ongoing losses and cash conservation. Revenue concentration in 2023 was primarily from commercial product sales (AUD 59,578,531 thousand) and BARDA revenue (AUD 5,662,938 thousand), with geographic revenue mainly from the United States (AUD 51,763,960 thousand), followed by Australia and New Zealand and other countries, indicating a strong US market focus. Given the negative operating cash flow and net losses, future performance depends on improving profitability and operational cash flow, while the strong financing inflows provide runway for growth and investment. The company’s geographic and product revenue diversification may support future growth if cost control and earnings improve. |
