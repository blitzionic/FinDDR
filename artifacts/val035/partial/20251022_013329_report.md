# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's reported revenue shows a significant discrepancy in 2022 (AUD 41,890,603k) compared to 2023 (AUD 66,535k) and 2024 (AUD 104,763k), indicating a likely data inconsistency or restatement. Focusing on 2023 to 2024, revenue grew by approximately 57.4% (from AUD 66,535k to AUD 104,763k), reflecting strong top-line growth. Gross margin data is incomplete for 2024, but 2023 shows an anomalous negative gross margin of -92,556.32%, which is inconsistent with the positive gross profit of AUD 61,715,417k and cost of goods sold of AUD 61,648,882k, suggesting data errors. In 2022, gross margin was a healthy 104.41%. Revenue by product/service in 2024 is dominated by commercial product sales at AUD 92,042k (87.9% of total revenue), with BARDA revenue contributing AUD 11,150k (10.6%), both showing strong growth from 2023 (commercial sales AUD 59,578.5k and BARDA AUD 5,662.9k). Geographically, the US market is the largest contributor, increasing from AUD 51,763.96k in 2023 to AUD 79,836k in 2024 (54.5% growth), while Australia and New Zealand and other countries also show growth, indicating successful geographic expansion and diversification. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin data is only available for 2022 and 2023, with 2022 at -2.75% and 2023 showing an anomalous -7,414.29%, likely due to data inconsistencies. Operating income was negative in both years: AUD -1,150,924k in 2022 and AUD -4,933,098k in 2023, despite positive gross profit in 2023, indicating high operating expenses (AUD 66,648,515k in 2023 vs AUD 41,192,931k in 2022). This suggests deteriorating operating efficiency and cost management challenges in 2023. Operating income data for 2024 is not available, but net profit margin improved to a positive 5.02% in 2024 from a negative -7.40% in 2023, implying improved operational performance or cost control in 2024. The relationship between operating income and revenue indicates that despite revenue growth, operating losses persisted in 2023, highlighting the need for better expense management. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shows unusual negative values in 2024 (-207.48%) and near zero in 2023 (-0.18%), compared to -3.62% in 2022, indicating tax benefits or credits impacting profitability, possibly from loss carrybacks or adjustments. Income tax expense was negative in 2024 (AUD -3,550k), suggesting tax refunds or credits, which positively affected net profit. Non-recurring items are not explicitly detailed, but the large swings in tax rates and net profit margins suggest one-off tax impacts or adjustments. External factors such as geographic revenue shifts and increased BARDA revenue may reflect government contracts or grants influencing profitability. Overall, tax effects and possible one-off items materially influenced net profitability, especially in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a stronger financial position compared to 2023, with total assets increasing from 92,621 to 108,720 thousand AUD, reflecting asset growth of approximately 17.4%. Both current assets and non-current assets grew, indicating investment in both short-term liquidity and long-term resources. Total liabilities rose from 27,238 to 36,596 thousand AUD, an increase of about 34.4%, driven primarily by a significant rise in current liabilities from 12,668 to 23,247 thousand AUD, while non-current liabilities slightly decreased. Shareholders' equity improved from 65,383 to 72,124 thousand AUD, showing enhanced net worth and capital base. The current ratio decreased from 531.69% to 341.10%, indicating a reduction in liquidity but still a strong ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio increased from 41.66% to 50.74%, suggesting a higher leverage but still moderate relative to equity. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth in assets and equity with manageable increases in liabilities, maintaining a solid financial foundation. | In 2023, the company reported total assets of AUD 92,621 thousand, with current assets comprising AUD 67,354 thousand and non-current assets AUD 25,267 thousand. Total liabilities stood at AUD 27,238 thousand, split between current liabilities of AUD 12,668 thousand and non-current liabilities of AUD 14,570 thousand. Shareholders' equity was AUD 65,383 thousand, indicating a solid equity base relative to liabilities, reflected in a debt to equity ratio of 41.66%. The current ratio was 531.69%, suggesting very strong liquidity and an ability to cover short-term obligations comfortably. Retained earnings were negative at AUD (121,378) thousand, which may reflect accumulated losses or distributions exceeding earnings historically. Overall, the balance sheet shows a strong liquidity position and moderate leverage, but the negative retained earnings highlight past profitability challenges or accounting adjustments affecting equity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company’s profitability improved markedly in 2024. Revenue surged from 66,535 to 104,763 thousand AUD, a 57.5% increase, driven by higher commercial product sales and BARDA revenue. Net profit turned positive at 5,261 thousand AUD compared to a net loss of 4,924 thousand AUD in 2023, indicating a significant turnaround in earnings quality. Income before taxes also improved from a loss of 4,933 thousand AUD to a positive 1,711 thousand AUD. The net profit margin improved from a negative 7.40% to a positive 5.02%, reflecting better cost management or revenue quality despite unavailable gross and operating profit data for 2024. Return on equity and return on assets were reported at 7.65% and 5.23% respectively, indicating reasonable returns on invested capital and assets, supporting earnings sustainability. However, the effective tax rate was highly negative at -207.48%, likely due to tax benefits or adjustments, which may affect earnings quality assessment. | The 2023 income statement reveals a complex picture. Revenue was AUD 66,535 thousand, with commercial product sales contributing AUD 59,578,531 and BARDA revenue AUD 5,662,938. Cost of goods sold was extremely high at AUD 61,648,882, resulting in a gross profit of AUD 61,715,417, which appears inconsistent given the revenue figure and may indicate data anomalies. Operating expenses were AUD 66,648,515, leading to an operating loss of AUD (4,933,098). Net profit was a small loss of AUD (4,924), a significant improvement from the 2022 net loss of AUD (1,192,532). Margins are distorted with reported gross margin at (92,556.32%) and operating margin at (7,414.29%), likely due to data inconsistencies. The net profit margin is reported as (7.40%), which conflicts with the net loss figure and revenue. Return on equity and return on assets are unavailable, limiting assessment of earnings sustainability. The effective tax rate was minimal and negative at (0.18%), consistent with losses. Overall, profitability remains weak with operating losses, but net loss has improved substantially compared to 2022. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency indicators for 2024 show mixed signals. The asset turnover ratio was very high at 104.07, suggesting excellent utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, operating margin and cost control metrics are unavailable for 2024, limiting detailed margin analysis. Net cash from operations improved dramatically from a large outflow of 6,612,528 thousand AUD in 2023 to a positive inflow of 3,683 thousand AUD in 2024, indicating improved cash generation from core business activities. Inventories doubled from 4,530 to 8,972 thousand AUD, which may imply increased stock levels to support higher sales or potential inventory management challenges. Working capital increased as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, though the current ratio declined, suggesting tighter short-term liquidity management. Overall, operational efficiency appears to have improved with better cash flow and asset utilization, but cost control details are lacking. | Operating expenses exceeded operating income, with an operating loss of AUD (4,933,098) in 2023, indicating challenges in cost control. The net cash from operations was negative at AUD (6,612,528), worsening from the 2022 negative cash flow of AUD (2,057,034), signaling operational cash burn. Asset turnover and other asset utilization ratios are unavailable, limiting efficiency analysis. Inventories were AUD 4,530 thousand, but without turnover data, inventory management efficiency cannot be assessed. The large negative operating cash flow despite positive gross profit suggests working capital or non-cash adjustments impacting cash generation. Overall, operational efficiency appears strained with high operating expenses and negative operating cash flow. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show some areas of concern. The debt to equity ratio increased to 50.74% from 41.66%, indicating higher leverage and potential increased financial risk. Current liabilities nearly doubled, which could pressure liquidity despite a still strong current ratio of 341.10%. Interest expense remained stable at around 720 thousand AUD, but interest coverage data for 2024 is unavailable, limiting assessment of the company’s ability to service debt from operating income. The effective tax rate was significantly negative at -207.48%, which may reflect tax credits or adjustments but could also indicate volatility in tax obligations. The net cash from financing activities turned negative at (3,170) thousand AUD compared to a large inflow in 2023, suggesting reduced external financing or debt repayment. These factors combined suggest moderate financial risk with increased leverage and some tax-related volatility, warranting monitoring. | Leverage is moderate with a debt to equity ratio of 41.66%, indicating manageable financial risk from debt. The current ratio of 531.69% reflects strong liquidity, reducing short-term solvency risk. Interest expense was low at AUD 714, and interest coverage ratio is reported as (690,910.08%), an anomalous figure likely due to negative operating income and low interest expense, thus not reliable. The effective tax rate was negative at (0.18%), consistent with losses and minimal tax burden. The negative retained earnings of AUD (121,378) thousand may signal accumulated losses, posing a risk to equity stability. Overall, liquidity and leverage risks appear low, but profitability and retained earnings deficits present underlying financial risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company’s future financial performance outlook appears positive based on 2024 data. Investment activities showed a small net cash outflow of (1,490) thousand AUD, down from a larger outflow in 2023, indicating more controlled or reduced capital expenditures. The positive net cash from operations and absence of dividends suggest cash flow sustainability and potential for reinvestment. Revenue growth was strong across all geographic regions, especially in the United States (from 51,763,960 to 79,836,000 thousand AUD) and other countries (from 8,708,499 to 16,796,000 thousand AUD), indicating expanding market presence and diversification. Commercial product sales and BARDA revenue both increased significantly, supporting growth prospects. The increase in shareholders' equity and retained earnings (less negative) also supports a stable capital base for future growth. Overall, the data points to continued expansion and improving financial health, with manageable investment and financing activities aligned with growth strategies. | Net cash from investing activities was negative at AUD (848,768), indicating investment outflows, a decrease from positive investing cash flow in 2022. Net cash from financing activities was strongly positive at AUD 48,064,381, a reversal from negative financing cash flow in 2022, suggesting significant capital inflows or financing events supporting liquidity. The net increase in cash was AUD 40,603,085, a substantial improvement over 2022. No dividends were paid in 2023, consistent with the loss position. Revenue concentration is notable in the United States (AUD 51,763,960), with smaller contributions from Australia/New Zealand and other countries, indicating geographic revenue diversification but heavy reliance on the US market. The large financing inflows and investment outflows suggest the company is funding growth or restructuring. Cash flow sustainability depends on improving operational cash generation. Overall, future performance may improve if operational losses are controlled and investment supports growth in key markets. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Company faces market risks including increased competition which may lead to loss of market share, and the risk that products may be superseded by medical advancements resulting in alternative treatments. Demand volatility is inherent given the nature of the medical device category, though the Company has demonstrated strong sales growth across multiple geographies. Inflation and rising interest rates have increased costs such as wages and salaries. The Company mitigates these risks by strategic product development, continuous review of product roadmaps, expanding into new markets (e.g., Japan, China, India), and investing in clinical education and professional programs to drive adoption. The Company also monitors market dynamics and customer behavior to adapt its offerings. | The Group faces market risks including demand volatility and competition inherent in the biotechnology sector, which is highly volatile and speculative. Risks arise from the success of research projects, the ability to attract funding, and the commercialisation of drugs and medical devices. Market growth depends on surgeon acceptance, clinical outcomes, and regulatory approvals. Inflation and rising interest rates have increased costs such as wages and salaries across all markets. The Group operates in multiple geographic markets with exposure to foreign currency fluctuations impacting sales and costs. The Group mitigates foreign currency risk by maintaining cash and equivalents in multiple currencies and matching receivables and payables in those currencies. The Group also faces risks from rapid advancements in technology and uncertainty of patent protection and proprietary rights. The Group actively expands into new markets and product indications to manage growth risks. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include concentration of manufacturing at a single site which could disrupt supply if the site becomes inoperative. The Company mitigates this by constructing a third manufacturing facility, implementing a business continuity plan, maintaining business interruption insurance, and considering additional manufacturing sites in different jurisdictions. Reliance on suppliers for key materials poses risks of delay and disruption; mitigation includes close collaboration with suppliers, inventory management, and diversification of suppliers. Product liability risks exist related to product quality failures that could lead to injury, litigation, recall, and reputational harm; mitigated by rigorous quality control, clinical collaboration, and product liability insurance. Intellectual property risks from hacking or employee disclosure are managed through confidentiality agreements, limited and monitored system access, and legal counsel support. The Company also faces risks in product development and clinical trial processes inherent in pharmaceutical and medical product development. | Operational risks include challenges in research, development, and commercialisation of medical devices, which may materially impact financial performance and asset values.
