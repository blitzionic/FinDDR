# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Telstra Group Limited's revenue showed a steady increase from AUD 21,277 million in 2022 to AUD 22,702 million in 2023, and further to AUD 22,928 million in 2024, indicating consistent top-line growth. The gross margin remained stable at approximately 87.43% in 2023 and 2024, slightly down from 87.55% in 2022, reflecting strong cost control relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service reveals Mobile as the largest contributor, growing from AUD 9,470 million in 2022 to AUD 10,722 million in 2024. Fixed - C&SB and Fixed - Enterprise segments showed slight declines over the period, while International revenue nearly doubled from AUD 1,501 million in 2022 to AUD 2,578 million in 2024, highlighting growth in offshore markets. Geographically, Australian customer revenue increased from AUD 20,028 million in 2022 to AUD 20,793 million in 2024, while offshore customer revenue rose significantly from AUD 1,249 million to AUD 2,135 million, indicating expanding international presence. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 14.94% in 2023 to 13.30% in 2024 after an increase from 13.62% in 2022 to 14.94% in 2023, suggesting some pressure on operating profitability despite revenue growth. Operating income rose from AUD 2,898 million in 2022 to AUD 3,392 million in 2023 but then decreased to AUD 3,049 million in 2024, while operating expenses increased steadily from AUD 14,758 million in 2022 to AUD 15,938 million in 2024. This indicates that cost management challenges emerged in 2024, with operating expenses growing faster than revenue, impacting operating income and margin negatively. The consistent increase in operating expenses despite stable gross margins suggests rising overhead or administrative costs. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 26.88% in 2022 to 28.36% in 2023 before declining to 27.46% in 2024, which slightly compressed net profit margins from 8.49% in 2023 to 7.07% in 2024. Income tax expense followed a similar pattern, rising from AUD 667 million in 2022 to AUD 812 million in 2023, then decreasing to AUD 677 million in 2024. Non-recurring items were only explicitly noted in 2022 and 2023 with one-off nbn DA & connection revenues of AUD 378 million and AUD 72 million respectively, absent in 2024, which may have contributed to the higher net profit margin in 2022 and 2023. No other external factors explicitly affecting profitability were listed in the provided data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, Telstra Group Limited's total assets increased slightly to AUD 45,550 million from AUD 45,029 million in 2023, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets (AUD 39,443 million vs. AUD 38,296 million). Current assets declined to AUD 6,107 million from AUD 6,733 million, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity resources. Total liabilities rose to AUD 28,198 million from AUD 27,213 million, with current liabilities increasing notably to AUD 11,526 million from AUD 10,092 million, while non-current liabilities decreased slightly. Shareholders' equity decreased to AUD 17,352 million from AUD 17,816 million, reflecting retained earnings decline. The current ratio fell from 66.72% to 52.98%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased from 152.74% to 162.51%, indicating a higher leverage position and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company shows stable asset growth but with increased leverage and reduced liquidity in 2024 compared to 2023. | In 2023, Telstra Group Limited demonstrated growth in total assets, increasing from AUD 41,628 million in 2022 to AUD 45,029 million, driven by rises in both current assets (from AUD 6,260 million to AUD 6,733 million) and non-current assets (from AUD 35,368 million to AUD 38,296 million). Total liabilities also increased from AUD 24,652 million to AUD 27,213 million, with current liabilities rising modestly and non-current liabilities growing more significantly. Shareholders' equity improved from AUD 16,976 million to AUD 17,816 million, reflecting retained earnings growth. The current ratio improved slightly from 64.55% to 66.72%, indicating a marginally better liquidity position. However, the debt to equity ratio increased from 145.22% to 152.74%, suggesting a higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company maintained a solid financial base with asset growth and equity strengthening, but with increased leverage and liabilities that warrant monitoring. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue grew modestly by 0.99% to AUD 22,928 million in 2024 from AUD 22,702 million in 2023. Gross profit increased slightly to AUD 20,045 million, maintaining a stable gross margin of 87.43%. However, operating income declined by 10.1% to AUD 3,049 million, causing the operating margin to drop from 14.94% to 13.30%. Net profit decreased by 15.8% to AUD 1,622 million, with net profit margin falling from 8.49% to 7.07%. Return on equity declined from 11.08% to 9.22%, and return on assets decreased from 4.45% to 3.58%, indicating reduced earnings efficiency relative to equity and assets. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 27.46% from 28.36%. Overall, while revenue and gross profit remained stable, profitability and earnings quality weakened in 2024 due to higher operating expenses and interest costs. | Telstra's revenue increased by approximately 6.6% from AUD 21,277 million in 2022 to AUD 22,702 million in 2023, supported notably by growth in mobile and international segments. Gross profit rose from AUD 18,629 million to AUD 19,849 million, though the gross margin slightly declined from 87.55% to 87.43%, indicating stable cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income improved by 17.1% to AUD 3,392 million, with operating margin increasing from 13.62% to 14.94%, reflecting better operational control or higher-margin revenue mix. Net profit increased by 14.2% to AUD 1,928 million, with net profit margin improving from 7.93% to 8.49%. Return on equity was reported at 11.08% and return on assets at 4.45%, indicating reasonable profitability relative to equity and asset base. The effective tax rate increased from 26.88% to 28.36%, slightly reducing net income but consistent with higher income before taxes. Overall, profitability improved with higher revenues and margins, supported by efficient cost management and earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased by 3.8% to AUD 15,938 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and contributing to margin compression. Cost of goods sold rose marginally by 1.05% to AUD 2,883 million. Asset turnover declined from 52.40% to 50.63%, indicating slightly less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations improved by 3.6% to AUD 7,049 million, reflecting solid cash generation despite lower net profits. Inventories decreased to AUD 518 million from AUD 546 million, suggesting tighter inventory management. Net cash used in investing activities reduced to AUD (4,990) million from AUD (5,951) million, indicating lower capital expenditure or asset purchases. Net cash used in financing activities increased to AUD (1,942) million from AUD (969) million, driven by higher dividend payments (AUD 2,022 million vs. AUD 1,964 million). Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals with improved cash flow from operations but rising costs and slightly reduced asset utilization. | Operating expenses increased from AUD 14,758 million to AUD 15,356 million, a 4% rise, which is lower than the revenue growth rate, indicating improved cost control. Cost of goods sold increased by 7.8%, slightly above revenue growth, but gross margin remained stable. Asset turnover was reported at 52.40%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased from AUD 7,249 million to AUD 6,802 million, a decline of about 6.1%, which may reflect changes in working capital or operational cash flow timing. Inventories increased from AUD 476 million to AUD 546 million, and current liabilities rose, suggesting some working capital expansion. Despite the decrease in operational cash flow, the company maintained positive cash generation. Overall, operational efficiency improved in cost control relative to revenue, with strong asset utilization, though cash flow from operations showed a slight decline. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased as evidenced by the rise in debt to equity ratio from 152.74% to 162.51%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. The current ratio declined significantly from 66.72% to 52.98%, highlighting potential liquidity pressure in meeting short-term obligations. Interest expense increased by 14.7% to AUD 767 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased from 507.03% to 397.52%, signaling reduced ability to cover interest payments comfortably. The effective tax rate slightly decreased, which may marginally improve net income but does not offset other risks. The increase in current liabilities and reduced current assets further accentuate liquidity risk. These factors collectively suggest elevated financial risk in 2024, warranting close monitoring of leverage and liquidity positions. | Leverage increased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio rising from 145.22% to 152.74%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased from AUD 522 million to AUD 669 million, and interest coverage ratio decreased from 555.17% to 507.03%, though still very strong, suggesting the company comfortably covers interest obligations despite higher debt costs. The current ratio improved slightly, indicating stable short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate increased, which could impact net profitability. Net cash from financing activities was negative at AUD (969) million, indicating debt repayments or dividend payments exceeding new borrowings. No explicit early warning signs such as liquidity distress or interest coverage concerns are evident, but the rising leverage and interest expense warrant monitoring for potential financial risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity appears to moderate with net cash used in investing activities decreasing to AUD (4,990) million from AUD (5,951) million, potentially indicating a more cautious capital expenditure approach. Net cash from operations remains strong at AUD 7,049 million, supporting cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments increased slightly to AUD 2,022 million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower net profits. Revenue growth in key segments such as Mobile (up to AUD 10,722 million) and International (up to AUD 2,578 million) suggests geographic and product diversification opportunities. However, declines in Fixed - C&SB and Fixed - Enterprise revenues may require strategic focus. The increase in offshore customer revenue and numbers indicates potential growth outside Australia. Overall, the company is positioned to sustain cash flows and dividends but must address profitability pressures and leverage to ensure robust future financial performance. | Investment activity intensified in 2023, with net cash used in investing activities increasing significantly from AUD (3,395) million to AUD (5,951) million, indicating substantial capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Dividends increased slightly from AUD (1,888) million to AUD (1,964) million, reflecting a stable or slightly more generous dividend policy, supported by improved profitability. Revenue growth was driven by mobile and international segments, with offshore customer revenue increasing substantially from AUD 1,249 million to AUD 2,074 million, suggesting geographic diversification and growth opportunities outside Australia. The increase in InfraCo Fixed and Amplitel revenues also indicates strengthening infrastructure and tower assets. Despite a slight decline in net cash from operations, the company appears to be investing heavily for future performance while maintaining shareholder returns. Cash flow sustainability will depend on operational cash flow recovery and managing financing needs amid increased investing outflows. |
