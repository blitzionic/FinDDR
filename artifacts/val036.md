# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 was 3.18%, increasing from $21,277m to $22,702m. The growth continued into 2024, with revenue reaching $22,928m, marking a 1.00% increase from 2023. The gross margin slightly decreased from 87.55% in 2022 to 87.43% in both 2023 and 2024, indicating stable cost management relative to revenue. In terms of product/service revenue, the Mobile segment showed significant growth from $9,470m in 2022 to $10,722m in 2024, while the Fixed - C&SB segment remained relatively stable. Geographic revenue distribution indicates a strong reliance on Australian customers, whose revenue increased from $20,028m in 2022 to $20,793m in 2024, while offshore revenue saw a notable increase from $1,249m to $2,135m, reflecting a growing international presence. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin trends show a decline from 14.94% in 2023 to 13.30% in 2024, despite an increase in operating income from $3,392m in 2023 to $3,049m in 2024. This suggests that while operating income increased, it did not keep pace with revenue growth, indicating potential inefficiencies or rising operating expenses, which increased from $15,356m in 2023 to $15,938m in 2024. The operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased, reflecting a need for improved cost management strategies to enhance operational performance. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 26.88% in 2022 to 27.46% in 2024, which may have impacted net profit margins, which decreased from 9.03% in 2023 to 7.80% in 2024. Non-recurring items were not specified, but the overall increase in tax expense from $667m in 2022 to $677m in 2024 indicates a growing tax burden. External factors such as market competition and economic conditions may also be influencing profitability, particularly in the offshore segment, which has shown significant growth but may face challenges in sustaining this momentum. |

| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | In FY24, Telstra faced economic challenges including increased cost of living pressures and inflationary pressures, which have made it tougher to meet cost reduction ambitions. The company is operating in a near constant state of global geopolitical and economic uncertainty, compounded by two major regional conflicts and numerous elections, which may impact overall economic conditions in Australia. These factors could affect revenue and profitability, as they are interconnected with other existing risks. | Changing financial conditions are contributing to key external macroeconomic uncertainties today, including weaker than anticipated economic growth, persistent high inflation, a tight labour market, persistent supply disruptions, and a decline in nonessential spending within households due to living cost pressures. These factors have been elevated to a 'Top Risk' for FY24, impacting revenue and profitability. The company is proactively monitoring demand uncertainty and adjusting operating plans and budgets as needed, including potential price increases in mobile plans in line with CPI to mitigate economic pressures. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The telecommunications and technology sectors are experiencing ongoing disruption and challenges, with significant competitive pressures from both established players and new entrants. Telstra's Enterprise business faced substantial challenges in FY24, prompting a strategic reset to streamline its product portfolio and improve focus. The company is also responding to technological acceleration and market dynamics through innovation and investment in core business areas, indicating a need to adapt to competitive threats and industry dynamics. | The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, with significant pressures from both established players and new entrants, including satellite operators and Low Earth Orbit satellite services. The company faces risks from declining pricing and market share if it fails to adapt to technological changes and competitive dynamics. Key competition risks include innovation and disruptive technologies that may cause market discontinuity, as well as the growth strategies of hyperscalers that could disintermediate the company from end-customers. Effective innovation and significant investments are required to maintain market position, but there is no guarantee these investments will yield the desired results. |
