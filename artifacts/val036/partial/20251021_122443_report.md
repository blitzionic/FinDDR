# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, total revenue increased from AUD 21,277m to AUD 22,928m, representing a compound growth of approximately 3.8% over two years. The growth from 2022 to 2023 was 6.7%, while from 2023 to 2024 it was modest at 1.0%. Gross margin remained stable and high, at 87.55% in 2022 and 87.43% in both 2023 and 2024, indicating consistent cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. By product/service, Mobile revenue showed steady growth from AUD 9,470m in 2022 to AUD 10,722m in 2024 (+13.2%), reflecting strong demand or market share gains. Fixed - C&SB and Fixed - Enterprise segments experienced slight declines over the period (C&SB from AUD 4,486m to 4,355m; Enterprise from AUD 3,729m to 3,537m), indicating potential competitive pressures or market shifts. Fixed - Active Wholesale declined from AUD 477m to AUD 366m, a notable contraction. International revenue nearly doubled from AUD 1,501m in 2022 to AUD 2,578m in 2024 (+71.7%), signaling successful expansion or increased offshore sales. InfraCo Fixed and Amplitel showed moderate growth, while Other revenue increased significantly from AUD 755m to AUD 1,262m (+67.1%). Geographically, Australian customer revenue grew steadily from AUD 20,028m to AUD 20,793m (+3.8%), while offshore customer revenue surged from AUD 1,249m to AUD 2,135m (+70.9%), consistent with the international product revenue trend and indicating a strategic focus on offshore markets. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 13.62% in 2022 to 13.30% in 2024, with a peak at 14.94% in 2023. Operating income rose from AUD 2,898m in 2022 to AUD 3,392m in 2023 (+17.0%) but then decreased to AUD 3,049m in 2024 (-10.1% from 2023). Despite revenue growth, operating income did not sustain its upward trajectory, suggesting rising operating expenses or efficiency challenges. Operating expenses increased steadily from AUD 14,758m in 2022 to AUD 15,938m in 2024 (+8.0%), outpacing revenue growth and contributing to margin compression. The ratio of operating income to revenue decreased, reflecting less efficient conversion of sales into operating profit. This indicates cost management effectiveness weakened slightly, with expenses growing faster than revenue, pressuring profitability despite stable gross margins. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 26.88% in 2022 to 28.36% in 2023 before slightly declining to 27.46% in 2024. This fluctuation modestly impacted net profit margins, which decreased from 8.53% in 2022 to 7.80% in 2024, following a peak of 9.03% in 2023. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data, suggesting profitability trends are driven by operational factors rather than one-off events. External factors influencing profitability include the significant growth in offshore revenue, which may expose the company to foreign exchange risks or regulatory environments affecting tax and operating costs. The steady increase in income tax expense from AUD 667m in 2022 to AUD 677m in 2024, despite fluctuating pre-tax profits, also suggests external tax environment impacts. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a modest increase in total assets to AUD 45,550 million from AUD 45,029 million in 2023, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets (AUD 39,443 million vs. AUD 38,296 million). Current assets declined to AUD 6,107 million from AUD 6,733 million, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity resources. Total liabilities increased to AUD 28,198 million from AUD 27,213 million, with current liabilities rising significantly to AUD 11,526 million from AUD 10,092 million, while non-current liabilities decreased slightly. Shareholders' equity decreased to AUD 17,352 million from AUD 17,816 million, reflecting retained earnings decline and possibly dividend payouts. The current ratio dropped from 66.72% to 52.98%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased to 162.51% from 152.74%, indicating higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet shows asset growth but with increased liabilities and reduced equity, suggesting a moderate weakening in financial position and liquidity in 2024 compared to 2023. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing by 8.1% from AUD 41,628 million in 2022 to AUD 45,029 million. This growth was driven by increases in both current assets (7.5%) and non-current assets (8.3%). Total liabilities rose by 10.4% to AUD 27,213 million, with current liabilities increasing by 4.1% and non-current liabilities by 14.5%. Shareholders' equity improved by 4.9% to AUD 17,816 million, reflecting retained earnings growth. The current ratio improved slightly from 64.55% to 66.72%, indicating a modest enhancement in liquidity. However, the debt to equity ratio increased from 145.22% to 152.74%, suggesting a higher leverage position. Overall, the balance sheet shows asset growth and equity strengthening, but with a rising reliance on debt financing. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased slightly by 1% to AUD 22,928 million in 2024 from AUD 22,702 million in 2023. Cost of goods sold rose marginally, maintaining a stable gross margin of 87.43%. However, operating income declined by 10.1% to AUD 3,049 million, and net profit decreased by 12.8% to AUD 1,788 million. Operating margin fell from 14.94% to 13.30%, and net profit margin declined from 9.03% to 7.80%, indicating margin compression. Return on equity dropped from 11.79% to 10.17%, and return on assets decreased from 4.73% to 3.95%, reflecting lower profitability and earnings quality. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 27.46% from 28.36%, providing minor tax relief. Overall, while revenue growth was positive, profitability and earnings quality weakened in 2024 due to higher operating expenses and lower net income margins. | Revenue increased by 6.7% to AUD 22,702 million in 2023, supported notably by growth in Mobile (+8.3%) and International (+61.8%) segments, and offshore customer revenue rising by 66%. Cost of goods sold increased by 7.7%, slightly outpacing revenue growth, resulting in a marginal decline in gross margin from 87.55% to 87.43%. Operating income grew by 17% to AUD 3,392 million, improving the operating margin from 13.62% to 14.94%, reflecting better cost control relative to revenue. Net profit rose by 13.1% to AUD 2,051 million, with net profit margin improving from 8.53% to 9.03%. Return on equity was 11.79% and return on assets 4.73%, indicating reasonable earnings quality and sustainability. The effective tax rate increased to 28.36%, slightly reducing net profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased by 3.8% to AUD 15,938 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth, which contributed to a decline in operating margin. Asset turnover decreased to 50.63% from 52.40%, indicating less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations improved to AUD 7,049 million from AUD 6,802 million, showing stronger cash generation despite lower profitability. Inventories decreased slightly to AUD 518 million from AUD 546 million, suggesting tighter inventory management. The current ratio decline and increased current liabilities may pressure working capital management. Overall, operational efficiency weakened in terms of margin and asset utilization, but cash flow from operations improved, supporting operational liquidity. | Operating expenses increased by 4.1% to AUD 15,356 million, a slower pace than revenue growth, contributing to improved operating margin. Asset turnover was 52.40%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations declined by 6.1% to AUD 6,802 million, suggesting some pressure on cash generation despite higher earnings. Inventories increased by 14.7%, which may indicate higher working capital requirements. The current ratio improved slightly, supporting liquidity. Overall, the company maintained good cost control and asset utilization but experienced a slight decline in operational cash flow. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased as evidenced by the rise in debt to equity ratio to 162.51% from 152.74%, indicating higher financial risk. Interest expense increased to AUD 696 million from AUD 630 million, while interest coverage ratio declined to 438.07% from 538.41%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest costs comfortably. The current ratio fell to 52.98% from 66.72%, signaling potential liquidity risk. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, which marginally reduces tax burden risk. The increase in current liabilities and decrease in current assets heighten short-term liquidity risk. Overall, the company faces elevated financial risk in 2024 due to higher leverage, reduced interest coverage, and weaker liquidity indicators. | Leverage increased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio rising to 152.74% from 145.22%, driven by a 10.4% increase in total liabilities. Interest expense rose by 19.5% to AUD 630 million, while interest coverage ratio slightly declined from 549.91% to 538.41%, still indicating strong ability to cover interest costs. The effective tax rate increased, which could impact net income sustainability. The slight decline in net cash from operations and increased investing outflows raise concerns about cash flow adequacy. Overall, while liquidity remains adequate, the rising leverage and interest costs warrant monitoring for potential financial risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a reduction in net cash used for investing to AUD (4,990) million from AUD (5,951) million, indicating a moderation in capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing activities shows increased outflows at AUD (1,942) million compared to AUD (969) million, driven likely by higher dividend payments (AUD 2,022 million vs. AUD 1,964 million) and possibly debt repayments. The net increase in cash was positive at AUD 117 million versus a decrease in 2023, suggesting improved cash flow sustainability. Revenue growth in key segments such as Mobile and InfraCo Fixed and increased offshore customer revenue indicate potential growth areas. However, margin compression and increased leverage may constrain future profitability. The company appears to maintain a stable dividend policy despite earnings pressure, supported by strong operating cash flows. Overall, future financial performance may see moderate growth with cautious investment and sustained shareholder returns amid margin and leverage challenges. | Investment activities intensified in 2023, with net cash used in investing increasing significantly to AUD (5,951) million from AUD (3,395) million, indicating aggressive capital expenditure or acquisitions. Financing cash flow was negative at AUD (969) million, and dividends increased to AUD (1,964) million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite higher investment outflows. Revenue growth in international markets and offshore customers suggests geographic expansion opportunities. However, the decline in net cash from operations and increased leverage may pressure future cash flow sustainability. The company appears positioned for growth but must balance investment with maintaining strong cash flow and managing debt levels. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Telstra faces market risks including ongoing disruption and challenges in the telecommunications and technology sectors, evolving market dynamics, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical risks such as regional conflicts and multiple elections. Customer demand for connectivity is rising rapidly, and there is heightened expectation from customers, stakeholders, governments, and industry partners. The company also faces risks from technological acceleration and competition, requiring continuous innovation and investment. Extreme weather events and climate change pose risks to infrastructure and operations, impacting power supplies and service continuity. Supply chain risks include managing supplier compliance and resilience, which can affect service delivery and reputation. Failure to meet ESG expectations and regulatory changes also present risks. Telstra manages these risks through technological innovation, strategic investments, maintaining network leadership, and a robust Supplier Risk Framework, while actively monitoring geopolitical and economic conditions. | The telecommunications industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, which may adversely impact earnings and assets. Significant competition exists in fixed broadband services over the nbn™ network, mobile and fixed businesses, and other segments such as Network Applications & Services, Data & Connectivity, and International.
