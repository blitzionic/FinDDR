# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Telstra Group Limited's revenue showed a steady increase from AUD 21,277 million in 2022 to AUD 22,702 million in 2023, and further to AUD 22,928 million in 2024, indicating consistent top-line growth. The gross margin remained stable at approximately 87.43% in 2023 and 2024, slightly down from 87.55% in 2022, reflecting strong cost control relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service reveals Mobile as the largest contributor, growing from AUD 9,470 million in 2022 to AUD 10,722 million in 2024. Fixed - C&SB and Fixed - Enterprise segments showed slight declines or stability, while International revenue nearly doubled from AUD 1,501 million in 2022 to AUD 2,578 million in 2024, highlighting growth in offshore markets. Geographically, Australian customer revenue increased modestly from AUD 20,028 million in 2022 to AUD 20,793 million in 2024, while offshore customer revenue rose significantly from AUD 1,249 million to AUD 2,135 million, indicating expanding international presence. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 14.94% in 2023 to 13.30% in 2024 after rising from 13.62% in 2022 to 14.94% in 2023, suggesting some pressure on operating profitability despite revenue growth. Operating income increased from AUD 2,898 million in 2022 to AUD 3,392 million in 2023 but then decreased to AUD 3,049 million in 2024, indicating a dip in operating profit in the latest year. Operating expenses rose steadily from AUD 14,758 million in 2022 to AUD 15,356 million in 2023 and AUD 15,938 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and contributing to margin compression. This suggests challenges in cost management, with operating expenses increasing by approximately AUD 1,180 million over three years, which may be linked to investments or inflationary pressures. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 26.88% in 2022 to 28.36% in 2023 before slightly decreasing to 27.46% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability in 2023. Income tax expense rose from AUD 667 million in 2022 to AUD 812 million in 2023, then decreased to AUD 677 million in 2024, reflecting these rate changes. Non-recurring items were explicitly listed only in 2022 and 2023 as 'One-off nbn DA & connection' revenues of AUD 378 million and AUD 72 million respectively, with none reported in 2024, indicating a reduction in one-off revenue contributions. No other external factors explicitly affecting profitability were provided in the data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, Telstra Group Limited's total assets increased slightly to AUD 45,550 million from AUD 45,029 million in 2023, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets (AUD 39,443 million vs. AUD 38,296 million). Current assets declined to AUD 6,107 million from AUD 6,733 million, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity resources. Total liabilities rose to AUD 28,198 million from AUD 27,213 million, with current liabilities increasing notably to AUD 11,526 million from AUD 10,092 million, while non-current liabilities decreased marginally. Shareholders' equity decreased to AUD 14,922 million from AUD 15,407 million, reflecting retained earnings decline and net profit reduction. The current ratio fell from 66.72% to 52.98%, signaling a weakening liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio increased from 176.63% to 188.97%, indicating a higher leverage and more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the company shows stable asset base growth but with increased leverage and reduced liquidity in 2024 compared to 2023. | In fiscal 2023, Telstra Group Limited demonstrated growth in total assets, increasing from AUD 41,628 million in 2022 to AUD 45,029 million, driven by rises in both current assets (from AUD 6,260 million to AUD 6,733 million) and non-current assets (from AUD 35,368 million to AUD 38,296 million). Total liabilities also increased notably from AUD 24,652 million to AUD 27,213 million, with current liabilities rising modestly and non-current liabilities increasing more substantially. Shareholders' equity, however, declined from AUD 16,976 million to AUD 15,407 million, indicating a contraction in net book value despite retained earnings slightly increasing. The current ratio improved slightly from 64.55% to 66.72%, suggesting a marginally better liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio worsened significantly from 145.22% to 176.63%, reflecting increased leverage and a heavier reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Overall, the company’s financial health shows asset growth and maintained liquidity but with increased leverage and a reduction in equity base, signaling a more aggressive capital structure in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue for 2024 increased modestly to AUD 22,928 million from AUD 22,702 million in 2023, a 1% growth. Gross profit rose slightly to AUD 20,045 million, maintaining a stable gross margin of 87.43%. However, operating income declined to AUD 3,049 million from AUD 3,392 million, causing the operating margin to drop from 14.94% to 13.30%. Net profit decreased significantly to AUD 1,622 million from AUD 1,928 million, with net profit margin falling from 8.49% to 7.07%. Return on equity and return on assets also declined to 10.70% and 3.58% respectively, down from 11.91% and 4.45%, indicating reduced earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 27.46% from 28.36%, and interest expense increased, contributing to lower income before taxes and net profit. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 despite stable revenue growth, reflecting margin compression and higher costs. | Telstra's revenue increased by approximately 6.7% from AUD 21,277 million in 2022 to AUD 22,702 million in 2023, driven primarily by growth in mobile services and offshore customer revenue. Gross profit rose from AUD 18,629 million to AUD 19,849 million, maintaining a stable gross margin around 87.4%, slightly down from 87.55%. Operating income improved by 17% to AUD 3,392 million, with operating margin increasing from 13.62% to 14.94%, indicating better operational profitability. Net profit increased by 14.2% to AUD 1,928 million, with net profit margin improving from 7.93% to 8.49%. Return on equity was reported at 11.91% and return on assets at 4.45%, both indicating reasonable returns on invested capital. The effective tax rate increased from 26.88% to 28.36%, slightly reducing after-tax profitability. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved in 2023, supported by revenue growth, margin expansion, and solid returns on equity and assets. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased to AUD 15,938 million from AUD 15,356 million in 2023, outpacing revenue growth and pressuring operating income. Cost of goods sold rose marginally to AUD 2,883 million from AUD 2,853 million, keeping gross margin stable. Asset turnover declined to 50.63% from 52.40%, indicating slightly less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations improved to AUD 7,049 million from AUD 6,802 million, showing strong cash generation despite lower profitability. Inventories decreased to AUD 518 million from AUD 546 million, suggesting tighter inventory management. Working capital dynamics show increased current liabilities and decreased current assets, which may impact short-term operational liquidity. Overall, Telstra demonstrated solid cash flow from operations and some inventory control, but rising operating expenses and reduced asset turnover point to challenges in operational efficiency. | Operating expenses increased from AUD 14,758 million to AUD 15,356 million, a rise of about 4%, which is lower than the revenue growth rate, contributing to improved operating margins. Cost of goods sold increased proportionally with revenue, maintaining gross margin stability. Asset turnover was reported at 52.40%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased from AUD 7,249 million to AUD 6,802 million, a decline of about 6%, which may reflect changes in working capital or operational cash flow timing. Inventories increased slightly from AUD 476 million to AUD 546 million, and current liabilities rose modestly, suggesting stable working capital management. Despite the decrease in operational cash flow, the company maintained positive cash generation from core operations. Overall, Telstra showed reasonable cost control and asset utilization, though operational cash flow softened somewhat in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio rising to 188.97% from 176.63%, indicating higher financial risk. The current ratio declined to 52.98% from 66.72%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity and potential pressure on meeting current obligations. Interest expense increased to AUD 696 million from AUD 630 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased to 438.07% from 538.41%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest costs comfortably. The effective tax rate slightly decreased, which may marginally improve net income but does not offset other risk factors. The increase in current liabilities and decrease in current assets further heighten liquidity risk. These factors combined suggest elevated financial risk and warrant close monitoring of leverage and liquidity positions. | Financial risk indicators show increased leverage with the debt to equity ratio rising sharply from 145.22% to 176.63%, indicating higher financial risk due to greater reliance on debt. Interest expense increased significantly from AUD 444 million to AUD 630 million, while interest coverage ratio declined from 652.70% to 538.41%, though still very strong, indicating the company comfortably covers interest obligations despite higher debt costs. The effective tax rate increased, which could pressure net income. Liquidity improved slightly as reflected by the current ratio increase from 64.55% to 66.72%, mitigating short-term liquidity risk. However, the decline in shareholders' equity and increased liabilities suggest a need for monitoring capital structure and solvency. No other explicit risks such as tax rate volatility or unusual expenses are evident from the data. Overall, financial risk has increased due to higher leverage and interest costs but remains manageable given strong interest coverage and liquidity. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity, as reflected by net cash from investing, decreased to AUD 4,990 million from AUD 5,951 million, indicating a reduction in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions. Net cash from financing turned positive at AUD 1,942 million compared to a negative AUD 969 million in 2023, suggesting increased financing inflows, possibly from debt or equity issuance. Dividends increased slightly to AUD 2,022 million from AUD 1,964 million, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower net profits. Revenue growth was driven mainly by increases in Mobile (AUD 10,722 million vs. AUD 10,258 million), International (AUD 2,578 million vs. AUD 2,429 million), InfraCo Fixed, Amplitel, and Other segments, while Fixed - C&SB and Fixed - Enterprise segments declined. Geographic revenue remained predominantly Australian customers with slight growth offshore. The combination of strong operational cash flow, stable dividend policy, and selective investment suggests moderate sustainability of financial performance, but margin pressures and increased leverage may constrain future profitability and growth potential. | Investment activity intensified in 2023, with net cash used in investing activities rising from AUD 3,395 million to AUD 5,951 million, indicating significant capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities turned negative at AUD (969) million compared to a positive AUD 3,971 million in 2022, reflecting possible debt repayments or changes in financing strategy. Dividends increased slightly from AUD 1,888 million to AUD 1,964 million, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns despite higher investment outflows. Revenue growth was driven by mobile and offshore segments, with offshore customer revenue increasing substantially from AUD 1,249 million to AUD 2,074 million, signaling geographic expansion opportunities. The decline in one-off nbn DA & connection revenue may indicate reduced non-recurring income, emphasizing the importance of core segment growth. Cash flow sustainability may be pressured by increased investing outflows and reduced operational cash flow, but dividend policy remains stable. Overall, Telstra appears focused on growth investments and geographic diversification, with a balanced approach to shareholder returns and financing. |
