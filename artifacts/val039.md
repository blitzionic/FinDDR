| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | 本集團的業務經營主要以香港為基地，任何對環球和本地經濟氣氛帶來之不利變化均可影響其整體業務表現。在全球經濟復甦緩慢、本地證券及地產市場疲弱，以及高息環境的拖累下，消費者情緒低迷，對旅遊及消費的意欲大減，本集團表現亦因此受到負面影響。儘管香港政府推出的活動可能帶來好處，管理層認為，與經濟前景相關的風險水平於報告年度大致上維持不變。 | The Group's business activities are primarily concentrated in Hong Kong, where local social stability and the government's removal of COVID-19 restrictions are beneficial for operations.

Despite these challenges, there was no significant change in the economic and political outlook that warranted an adjustment to the risk level during the reporting year. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | 儘管本年度訪港旅客數目上升及本地勞工市場改善，但零售市場因消費模式的轉變（如旅客來港目的的改變及電子商貿的普及）而面臨巨大挑戰。國際廣場租戶的業務前景尚未明朗，且在高息環境下，消費行為趨向保守，投資態度亦更為審慎，導致租戶面臨困難和違約風險持續。整體租金下調及出租率下跌的壓力與去年相比大致相若。 | The pace of retail market recovery remains unclear, particularly due to the adverse impacts of rising interest rates and banking crises. The difficulties faced by tenants in iSQUARE persist, and the risk of tenant defaults remains.
