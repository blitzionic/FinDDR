# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from 398,675 million USD in 2022 to 334,697 million USD in 2023, a decrease of approximately 16.07%, followed by a slight increase to 339,247 million USD in 2024, a 1.37% growth from 2023 but still 14.94% below 2022 levels. Gross margin showed a downward trend, decreasing from 31.88% in 2022 to 31.31% in 2023 and further to 29.53% in 2024, indicating rising cost pressures or pricing challenges. Revenue by product/service reveals mixed trends: Upstream revenue fell sharply by 24.3% from 41,097 million GBP in 2022 to 31,165 million GBP in 2023 but rebounded strongly by 55.4% to 48,416 million GBP in 2024, surpassing 2022 levels. Energy Products revenue declined steadily from 147,135 million GBP in 2022 to 127,672 million GBP in 2023 and further to 125,386 million GBP in 2024, a total drop of 14.8%. Chemical Products revenue decreased from 19,881 million GBP in 2022 to 16,074 million GBP in 2023 and remained flat at 16,058 million GBP in 2024, a 19.2% decline from 2022. Specialty Products revenue showed a slight decline from 8,764 million GBP in 2022 to 8,633 million GBP in 2023 and further to 8,274 million GBP in 2024, a 5.6% decrease overall. Geographically, revenue from the United States decreased from 149,225 million GBP in 2022 to 127,374 million GBP in 2023 but increased to 138,657 million GBP in 2024, partially recovering but still 7.1% below 2022. Non-U.S. revenue declined consistently from 249,450 million GBP in 2022 to 207,323 million GBP in 2023 and further to 200,590 million GBP in 2024, a 19.6% total decrease. This indicates a stronger recovery in the U.S. market compared to international markets, which continue to face challenges. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses decreased from 53,131 million USD in 2022 to 47,355 million USD in 2023, a 10.9% reduction, but rose again to 50,237 million USD in 2024, a 6.1% increase from 2023, indicating some volatility in cost control. Operating margin data is not provided, but the net profit margin declined from 13.98% in 2022 to 10.76% in 2023 and further to 9.93% in 2024, reflecting deteriorating profitability relative to revenue. Operating income figures are unavailable, but the decline in net profit margin alongside decreasing gross margin suggests operating efficiency challenges, possibly due to rising costs or lower pricing power. The relationship between operating income and revenue likely weakened over the period, as revenue fell and margins compressed. Overall, cost management showed initial improvement in 2023 but weakened in 2024, contributing to margin erosion. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 25.95% in 2022 to 29.23% in 2023 and slightly decreased to 28.26% in 2024, indicating a higher tax burden in recent years which negatively impacted net profitability. Income tax expense decreased from 20,176 million USD in 2022 to 15,429 million USD in 2023 and further to 13,810 million USD in 2024, consistent with lower pre-tax profits. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability likely include market conditions impacting revenue declines, especially in non-U.S. regions and certain product lines, as well as cost pressures reflected in declining gross margins. The tax rate increase may reflect changes in tax regulations or geographic profit mix. Overall, external and one-off impacts appear to have exerted downward pressure on net profit margins. |
