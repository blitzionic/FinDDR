# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from 398,675 million USD in 2022 to 334,697 million USD in 2023, a decrease of approximately 16.07%, followed by a slight increase to 339,247 million USD in 2024, a 1.37% growth from 2023 but still 14.94% below 2022 levels. Gross margin has steadily declined from 31.88% in 2022 to 31.31% in 2023 and further to 29.53% in 2024, indicating increasing cost pressures or pricing challenges. Revenue by product shows a consistent decline across all categories: Energy Products revenue dropped from 147,135 million GBP in 2022 to 125,386 million GBP in 2024 (a 14.77% decrease), Chemical Products fell from 19,881 million GBP to 16,058 million GBP (19.25% decrease), and Specialty Products slightly decreased from 8,764 million GBP to 8,274 million GBP (5.58% decrease). Geographically, revenue from the United States decreased from 149,225 million GBP in 2022 to 138,657 million GBP in 2024 (7.13% decrease), while Non-U.S. revenue declined more sharply from 249,450 million GBP to 200,590 million GBP (19.56% decrease), indicating a more pronounced revenue contraction outside the U.S. market. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses decreased from 53,131 million USD in 2022 to 47,155 million USD in 2023, then slightly increased to 50,237 million USD in 2024, reflecting some cost management efforts but with a slight rebound in 2024. Operating margin data is not provided, but net profit margin declined from 13.98% in 2022 to 10.76% in 2023 and further to 9.93% in 2024, indicating deteriorating profitability relative to revenue. The operating income figures are unavailable, but the relationship between operating expenses and revenue suggests that while costs were somewhat controlled in 2023, the overall profitability was pressured by declining revenues and gross margins. The net profit also decreased from 55,740 million USD in 2022 to 33,680 million USD in 2024, a 39.57% reduction, underscoring challenges in operational efficiency and profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 25.95% in 2022 to 29.23% in 2023 and slightly decreased to 28.26% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability by increasing tax expenses relative to pre-tax income. Income tax expense decreased from 20,176 million USD in 2022 to 15,429 million USD in 2023 and further to 13,810 million USD in 2024, consistent with lower pre-tax profits. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns provided. External factors such as significant revenue declines in Non-U.S. markets and overall market pressures likely contributed to the reduced profitability and margin compression observed over the period. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a strong overall financial position with total assets increasing significantly from 376,317 million USD in 2023 to 453,475 million USD, reflecting robust asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from 279,708 million USD to 361,485 million USD. Total liabilities also increased from 163,779 million USD to 182,869 million USD, but at a slower pace relative to equity, which grew substantially from 212,538 million USD to 270,606 million USD. This improvement in equity, alongside a reduction in the debt to equity ratio from 77.06% to 67.58%, indicates enhanced balance sheet strength and more conservative leverage. However, current assets decreased slightly from 96,609 million USD to 91,990 million USD, while current liabilities rose from 65,316 million USD to 70,307 million USD, causing the current ratio to decline from 147.91% to 130.84%, signaling a modest reduction in short-term liquidity. Overall, the company’s capital structure improved with stronger equity backing and manageable liability growth, supporting a solid financial foundation in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a stable and slightly improved financial position compared to 2022. Total assets increased modestly from 369,067 million USD to 376,317 million USD, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets (from 271,436 million USD to 279,708 million USD), while current assets slightly decreased. Total liabilities decreased from 166,594 million USD to 163,779 million USD, reflecting effective liability management. Shareholders' equity strengthened, rising from 202,473 million USD to 212,538 million USD, supported by an increase in retained earnings from 432,860 million USD to 453,927 million USD. Liquidity improved as indicated by the current ratio increasing from 141.40% to 147.91%, suggesting enhanced short-term financial stability. The debt to equity ratio declined from 82.28% to 77.06%, indicating a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects solid asset growth, prudent liability management, and a stronger equity base in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased modestly by 1.37% from 334,697 million USD in 2023 to 339,247 million USD in 2024. Despite this top-line growth, net profit declined by 6.5% from 36,010 million USD to 33,680 million USD, reflecting pressure on profitability. The net profit margin decreased from 10.76% to 9.93%, and the gross margin contracted from 31.31% to 29.53%, indicating rising cost of goods sold (up 4%) outpacing revenue growth. Operating expenses also increased by 6.5%, from 47,155 million USD to 50,237 million USD, further compressing margins. Return on equity declined from 17.35% to 13.94%, and return on assets fell from 9.66% to 8.12%, suggesting reduced earnings quality and lower efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets. The effective tax rate slightly decreased from 29.23% to 28.26%, providing some tax relief. Overall, profitability weakened in 2024 with margin compression and lower returns, raising concerns about earnings sustainability without operational improvements. | The company experienced a decline in revenue in 2023, falling from 398,675 million USD in 2022 to 334,697 million USD, a significant decrease. Correspondingly, cost of goods sold also decreased from 271,568 million USD to 229,914 million USD, maintaining a relatively stable gross margin which slightly declined from 31.88% to 31.31%. Operating expenses reduced from 53,131 million USD to 47,155 million USD, but net profit dropped substantially from 55,740 million USD to 36,010 million USD, causing the net profit margin to decline from 13.98% to 10.76%. Income before taxes decreased from 77,753 million USD to 52,783 million USD, and the effective tax rate increased from 25.95% to 29.23%, further compressing net earnings. Return on equity was 17.35% and return on assets was 9.66% in 2023, indicating moderate profitability and earnings sustainability despite the revenue contraction. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with lower revenues and net profits, though margins remained relatively stable and returns on capital stayed positive. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed signs of deterioration in 2024. The asset turnover ratio declined from 89.81% to 81.77%, indicating less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Operating expenses rose by 6.5%, outpacing revenue growth of 1.37%, which suggests cost control challenges. Inventories decreased slightly from 25,120 million USD to 23,524 million USD, which may reflect tighter inventory management. Net cash from operations remained relatively stable but slightly decreased from 55,369 million USD to 55,022 million USD, indicating steady but not improved cash generation from core operations. Working capital pressure is evident as current liabilities increased while current assets decreased, contributing to a lower current ratio. Overall, the company’s operational efficiency weakened in 2024 due to rising costs and declining asset utilization, which may impact future profitability if not addressed. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed results. The company managed to reduce operating expenses from 53,131 million USD to 47,155 million USD, reflecting some cost control efforts. The asset turnover ratio was 0.8981 (89.81%), indicating that the company generated approximately 0.9 USD in revenue for every 1 USD of assets, which suggests moderate asset utilization. However, net cash from operations declined significantly from 76,797 million USD in 2022 to 55,369 million USD in 2023, indicating reduced cash generation from core business activities. Working capital remained relatively stable with current assets slightly decreasing and current liabilities also decreasing, supporting a healthy current ratio of 147.91%. Inventories increased slightly from 24,435 million USD to 25,120 million USD, which may warrant monitoring for inventory management efficiency. Overall, while cost control improved, the decline in operational cash flow and moderate asset turnover suggest some challenges in operational efficiency in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators present a mixed picture in 2024. Leverage decreased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio falling from 77.06% to 67.58%, reducing financial risk related to debt burden. However, interest expense increased from 849 million USD to 996 million USD, which could pressure interest coverage, though the exact interest coverage ratio is unavailable. Liquidity risk increased slightly as the current ratio declined from 147.91% to 130.84%, reflecting tighter short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate decreased marginally, which slightly improves net income but does not materially affect risk. The decline in net profit and operating margins, combined with increased interest expense, suggests some earnings vulnerability. The negative net cash flow from financing activities increased from (34,297) million USD to (42,789) million USD, indicating higher outflows possibly related to debt repayments or dividends, which could strain liquidity. Overall, while leverage risk has moderated, liquidity and earnings risks have increased, warranting close monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a moderate risk profile with some areas to monitor. The debt to equity ratio improved to 77.06% from 82.28% in 2022, indicating reduced leverage and a more conservative capital structure. The current ratio increased to 147.91%, reflecting strong liquidity and ability to cover short-term obligations. Interest expense slightly increased from 798 million USD to 849 million USD, but interest coverage ratio data is unavailable, limiting assessment of interest burden sustainability. The effective tax rate rose from 25.95% to 29.23%, which could impact net profitability and cash flows. The decline in net cash from operations and the modest net increase in cash (only 1,903 million USD in 2023 versus 22,863 million USD in 2022) may signal tighter liquidity conditions. No significant spikes in liabilities or unusual financing activities were noted. Overall, the company maintains manageable financial risk but should monitor interest costs and cash flow trends closely. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities remained consistent with net cash used in investing slightly increasing from (19,274) million USD to (19,938) million USD, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions supporting future growth. Dividends increased from (14,941) million USD to (16,704) million USD, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns but potentially limiting internal cash retention. Net cash from operations remained stable, but the net decrease in cash of (8,381) million USD in 2024 versus a net increase in 2023 suggests tighter cash flow sustainability. Revenue by geographic region shows growth in the United States from 127,374 million GBP to 138,657 million GBP, while non-U.S. revenue declined slightly, indicating a possible geographic shift or concentration risk. Product segment revenues declined slightly across Energy, Chemical, and Specialty Products, signaling potential challenges in market demand or pricing. Overall, the company is investing for growth and maintaining dividends but faces cash flow pressures and mixed market trends that may impact future financial performance. | Investment activities in 2023 intensified as net cash used in investing increased from (14,742) million USD to (19,274) million USD, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Net cash from financing activities improved slightly from (39,114) million USD to (34,297) million USD, with dividends remaining stable at approximately (14,941) million USD, suggesting a consistent dividend policy. The modest net increase in cash of 1,903 million USD despite significant investing outflows points to potential pressure on liquidity. Revenue declines were observed across all major product lines and geographic regions, with Energy Products revenue falling from 147,135 million GBP to 127,672 million GBP and U.S. revenue decreasing from 149,225 million GBP to 127,374 million GBP, indicating possible market or demand challenges. These trends suggest cautious future performance with potential headwinds, but ongoing investments and stable dividend payments reflect management's commitment to growth and shareholder returns. Monitoring market conditions and operational cash flow sustainability will be critical for future financial health. |
