# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from 398,675 million USD in 2022 to 334,697 million USD in 2023, a decrease of approximately 16.07%, followed by a slight increase to 339,247 million USD in 2024, a 1.36% growth from 2023 but still 14.94% below 2022 levels. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) followed a similar trend, decreasing from 271,568 million USD in 2022 to 229,914 million USD in 2023 (-15.29%) and then rising to 239,063 million USD in 2024 (+3.95%). Gross profit declined from 127,107 million USD in 2022 to 104,783 million USD in 2023 (-17.55%) and further to 100,184 million USD in 2024 (-4.39%). Correspondingly, gross margin decreased steadily from 31.88% in 2022 to 31.31% in 2023 and 29.53% in 2024, indicating margin compression likely due to rising costs or pricing pressures. Revenue by product/service shows notable shifts: Upstream U.S. revenue dropped sharply from £14,579m in 2022 to £9,500m in 2023 (-34.86%) but rebounded to £22,929m in 2024 (+141.36% from 2023). Upstream Non-U.S. revenue declined consistently from £30,585m in 2022 to £16,074m in 2023 (-47.44%) and further to £14,202m in 2024 (-11.63%). Energy Products revenue decreased from £117,824m in 2022 to £103,868m in 2023 (-11.84%) and slightly to £101,325m in 2024 (-2.45%). Energy Products Non-U.S. also declined from £188,153m in 2022 to £164,515m in 2023 (-12.56%) and £159,531m in 2024 (-3.05%). Chemical and Specialty Products revenues similarly trended downward or remained flat. Geographically, U.S. revenue decreased from £149,225m in 2022 to £127,374m in 2023 (-14.66%) but increased to £138,657m in 2024 (+8.82%). Non-U.S. revenue declined from £249,450m in 2022 to £207,323m in 2023 (-16.87%) and further to £200,590m in 2024 (-3.29%). Key markets like the UK, Singapore, and France saw consistent revenue declines over the period, indicating possible regional challenges or strategic shifts. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income decreased from 73,360 million USD in 2022 to 56,868 million USD in 2023 (-22.47%) and further to 49,823 million USD in 2024 (-12.36%). Operating margin followed a similar downward trend from 18.40% in 2022 to 16.99% in 2023 and 14.69% in 2024, reflecting reduced operational profitability relative to revenue. Operating expenses decreased from 53,747 million USD in 2022 to 47,915 million USD in 2023 (-10.88%) but increased to 50,361 million USD in 2024 (+5.07%), indicating some cost control in 2023 but a slight rise in 2024. The ratio of operating income to revenue declined, suggesting that cost management was insufficient to offset revenue declines and margin pressures. Overall, the company experienced deteriorating operating efficiency with shrinking margins and operating income despite some expense management efforts. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 25.95% in 2022 to 29.23% in 2023 and slightly decreased to 28.26% in 2024. This rise in tax rate in 2023 likely contributed to lower net profit margins, which fell from 14.44% in 2022 to 11.16% in 2023 and further to 10.34% in 2024. Income tax expense decreased from 20,176 million USD in 2022 to 15,429 million USD in 2023 (-23.53%) and to 13,810 million USD in 2024 (-10.52%), consistent with lower pre-tax profits. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the data provided. External factors such as regional revenue declines, especially in Non-U.S. markets and key countries like the UK, Singapore, and France, may have negatively impacted profitability. The fluctuations in upstream segment revenues, particularly the sharp rebound in Upstream U.S. in 2024, suggest possible market or regulatory influences affecting segment performance. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated significant asset growth with total assets increasing from $376,317 million in 2023 to $453,475 million, driven primarily by a rise in non-current assets from $279,708 million to $361,485 million. Total liabilities also increased from $163,779 million to $182,869 million, with both current liabilities and non-current liabilities rising. Despite this, the equity position strengthened markedly, with shareholders' equity growing from $212,538 million to $270,606 million and retained earnings increasing from $453,927 million to $470,903 million. The current ratio declined from 147.91% to 130.84%, indicating a slight reduction in liquidity but still maintaining a comfortable level above 1. The debt to equity ratio improved from 77.06% to 67.58%, reflecting better liability management and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet shows robust growth in assets and equity, with manageable increases in liabilities and a solid liquidity position. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a stable overall financial position with total assets increasing modestly from 369,067 million USD in 2022 to 376,317 million USD, indicating asset growth primarily driven by non-current assets rising from 271,436 million USD to 279,708 million USD. Current assets slightly decreased from 97,631 million USD to 96,609 million USD. Total liabilities decreased from 166,594 million USD to 163,779 million USD, reflecting effective liability management, particularly a reduction in current liabilities from 69,045 million USD to 65,316 million USD, though non-current liabilities slightly increased from 97,549 million USD to 98,463 million USD. Shareholders' equity strengthened, rising from 202,473 million USD to 212,538 million USD, supported by an increase in retained earnings from 432,860 million USD to 453,927 million USD. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio increasing from 141.40% to 147.91%, and the debt to equity ratio decreased from 82.28% to 77.06%, indicating a more conservative capital structure and enhanced balance sheet strength. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased modestly by approximately 1.36% from $334,697 million in 2023 to $339,247 million in 2024. However, gross profit declined from $104,783 million to $100,184 million, resulting in a gross margin contraction from 31.31% to 29.53%. Operating income decreased from $56,868 million to $49,823 million, with operating margin falling from 16.99% to 14.69%. Net profit also declined from $37,354 million to $35,063 million, and net profit margin decreased from 11.16% to 10.34%. Return on equity dropped from 18.00% to 14.51%, and return on assets fell from 10.02% to 8.45%, indicating reduced earnings efficiency and profitability. The effective tax rate slightly decreased from 29.23% to 28.26%, providing some tax relief. Overall, profitability and earnings quality weakened in 2024, with margin compressions and lower returns despite revenue growth. | The company experienced a decline in revenue from 398,675 million USD in 2022 to 334,697 million USD in 2023, a significant decrease impacting profitability. Correspondingly, gross profit decreased from 127,107 million USD to 104,783 million USD, with gross margin slightly contracting from 31.88% to 31.31%. Operating income fell from 73,360 million USD to 56,868 million USD, and operating margin declined from 18.40% to 16.99%, reflecting margin pressure. Net profit dropped substantially from 57,577 million USD to 37,354 million USD, with net profit margin decreasing from 14.44% to 11.16%. Return on equity was reported at 18.00% and return on assets at 10.02% in 2023, indicating moderate earnings quality and reasonable returns relative to equity and assets despite the revenue decline. The effective tax rate increased from 25.95% to 29.23%, which further compressed net earnings. Interest expense slightly increased from 798 million USD to 849 million USD but remained low relative to income, supporting earnings sustainability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased from $47,915 million in 2023 to $50,361 million in 2024, contributing to a reduced operating margin. Asset turnover declined from 89.81% to 81.77%, indicating less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from $55,369 million to $55,022 million, suggesting consistent cash generation despite lower profitability. Inventories decreased marginally from $24,626 million to $23,604 million, which may reflect improved inventory management. The current ratio's decline to 130.84% suggests a slight tightening in working capital liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency weakened due to higher costs and lower asset utilization, though cash flow from operations remained steady. | Operational efficiency showed some challenges in 2023. Operating expenses decreased from 53,747 million USD to 47,915 million USD, indicating cost control efforts. However, the operating margin declined, suggesting that cost reductions did not fully offset revenue decreases. Asset turnover was reported at 89.81%, reflecting the company's ability to generate revenue from its asset base, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations declined significantly from 76,797 million USD in 2022 to 55,369 million USD in 2023, indicating reduced cash generation capacity. Working capital management appears stable with inventories nearly flat (24,435 million USD to 24,626 million USD) and current liabilities decreasing, supporting liquidity. Overall, while cost control was evident, lower revenue and cash flow from operations suggest operational efficiency pressures. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators improved with the debt to equity ratio decreasing from 77.06% to 67.58%, signaling reduced financial risk from debt. However, interest expense increased from $849 million to $996 million, and interest coverage ratio declined from 6698.23% to 5002.31%, though still indicating very strong ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, reducing tax burden risk. The current ratio's decline to 130.84% suggests a moderate reduction in short-term liquidity buffer. The net cash from financing activities showed a larger outflow, increasing from $(34,297) million to $(42,789) million, which may indicate higher debt repayments or dividend payments. Overall, financial risk remains low with strong coverage ratios and improved leverage, but liquidity and financing cash flow trends warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show moderate leverage and liquidity risk. The debt to equity ratio improved to 77.06% from 82.28%, indicating reduced leverage. The current ratio increased to 147.91%, reflecting strong short-term liquidity. Interest coverage remains extremely high at 6,698.23%, down from 9,192.98% in 2022, indicating ample ability to cover interest expenses despite a slight increase in interest expense from 798 million USD to 849 million USD. The effective tax rate rose to 29.23% from 25.95%, which could signal increased tax burden risk. The decline in net cash from operations and net cash from financing activities (less negative at -34,297 million USD vs. -39,114 million USD) suggests cautious financing and liquidity management. No immediate financial distress signals are evident, but the decline in cash flow and profitability warrants monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities remained consistent with net cash used in investing slightly increasing from $(19,274) million to $(19,938) million, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions. Dividend payments increased from $(14,941) million to $(16,704) million, reflecting a commitment to returning value to shareholders but also higher cash outflows. Revenue by product shows growth in Upstream U.S. from £9,500m to £22,929m, while other segments like Energy Products and Specialty Products saw slight declines or stability, suggesting a shift or focus in product mix. Geographically, U.S. revenue increased from £127,374m to £138,657m, while Non-U.S. revenue declined slightly, indicating stronger domestic market performance. The net decrease in cash of $(8,381) million in 2024 compared to a net increase in 2023 signals potential cash flow pressures. Overall, the company is investing steadily and maintaining dividends, with growth concentrated in U.S. markets and upstream segments, but cash flow sustainability should be closely managed. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 with net cash used in investing increasing from -14,742 million USD to -19,274 million USD, indicating ongoing or expanded capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Despite lower net cash from operations, the company maintained dividend payments at approximately -14,941 million USD, consistent with 2022, suggesting a stable dividend policy and commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue declines across all major product lines and geographic regions, notably in Upstream U.S. (from £14,579m to £9,500m) and Non-U.S. segments, indicate potential challenges in market demand or pricing. The company’s asset base growth and investment outflows suggest a focus on long-term growth, but near-term revenue and cash flow pressures may impact performance. Continued monitoring of operational improvements and market conditions will be critical for future financial sustainability. |

These product innovations and technology features emphasize ExxonMobil’s strategy to continuously introduce differentiated, high-performance products that meet evolving market demands and support sustainability goals. | In 2023, ExxonMobil launched new high-performance polymer products through the startup of a 400 thousand metric tons per year performance polymers line in Baytown, Texas, producing Vistamaxx™ and Exact™ plastomers. These innovative materials enable improved automotive parts, construction materials, personal care products, and solar panels. The company also entered the linear alpha olefins market with the startup of a 350 thousand metric tons per year unit in Baytown producing Elevexx™ branded products, used in plastic packaging and high-performance engine and industrial oils. These product launches demonstrate ExxonMobil's commitment to introducing differentiated products that cater to evolving market demands. Additionally, the company is investing in a large petrochemical complex in China focused on high-performance polyethylene and polypropylene products, which will enhance market presence and serve domestic demand more efficiently. The Singapore Resid Upgrade project, expected to start in 2025, will introduce upgraded fuel oil products to strengthen ExxonMobil's lubricant and diesel offerings. These initiatives reflect strategic innovation and market differentiation through advanced product features and expanded manufacturing capacity. |
