Overall, Exxon Mobil demonstrated stable financial health with a solid equity base, manageable liabilities, and improved liquidity in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased modestly by 1.37% to $339,247 million in 2024 from $334,697 million in 2023. However, gross profit declined to $100,184 million from $104,783 million, resulting in a lower gross margin of 29.53% compared to 31.31% in 2023. Operating income decreased to $49,273 million from $55,068 million, with operating margin falling to 14.52% from 16.45%. Net profit also declined to $35,063 million from $37,354 million, with net profit margin dropping to 10.34% from 11.16%. Return on equity decreased to 14.97% from 18.68%, and return on assets declined to 8.45% from 10.02%, indicating reduced profitability and earnings quality. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 28.26% from 29.23%. Overall, despite revenue growth, profitability margins and returns weakened in 2024, suggesting margin pressure and lower earnings efficiency. | Exxon Mobil's revenue declined by approximately 16% to $334,697 million in 2023 from $398,675 million in 2022, with all major product segments showing decreases, notably Upstream revenue dropping from $41,676 million to $25,574 million. Gross profit fell to $104,783 million from $127,107 million, and gross margin slightly decreased to 31.31% from 31.88%. Operating income declined more sharply to $55,068 million from $73,356 million, with operating margin contracting to 16.45% from 18.40%. Net profit dropped significantly to $37,354 million from $57,577 million, resulting in a net profit margin decline to 11.16% from 14.44%. Despite lower profitability, Exxon Mobil achieved a return on equity of 18.68% and return on assets of 10.02% in 2023, indicating efficient use of equity and assets to generate earnings. The effective tax rate increased to 29.23% from 25.95%, which partially contributed to the reduced net income. Overall, profitability and earnings quality weakened in 2023 due to lower revenues and margins but remained solid given the returns on equity and assets. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost of goods sold increased to $239,063 million from $229,914 million, outpacing revenue growth and contributing to margin compression. Operating expenses rose slightly to $50,911 million from $49,715 million, indicating controlled but increased operating costs. Asset turnover declined to 81.77% from 89.81%, reflecting less efficient utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations remained relatively stable at $55,022 million compared to $55,369 million in 2023, showing consistent cash generation capability. Inventories decreased slightly to $19,444 million from $20,528 million, which may indicate improved inventory management. Overall, operational efficiency shows some deterioration in asset utilization and margin control, but stable operational cash flow and working capital management. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed results. Cost of goods sold decreased to $229,914 million from $271,568 million, reflecting cost control aligned with lower revenue. Operating expenses also declined to $49,715 million from $53,751 million, indicating effective expense management. The asset turnover ratio was 89.81%, demonstrating strong asset utilization relative to revenue. Net cash from operations decreased significantly to $55,369 million from $76,797 million, reflecting lower profitability and possibly working capital changes. Inventories remained stable at approximately $20,528 million. Despite lower cash from operations, Exxon Mobil maintained positive operating cash flow, supporting ongoing operations. Cash flow from investing activities was negative at $19,274 million, higher than the prior year, indicating increased investment outlays. Financing cash flow was negative $34,297 million, slightly improved from 2022, with dividends stable at about $14,941 million. Overall, Exxon Mobil maintained operational efficiency through cost control and asset utilization but faced pressure on cash flow generation in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage decreased as evidenced by a lower debt to equity ratio of 69.35% compared to 79.97% in 2023, reducing financial risk. However, interest expense increased to $996 million from $849 million, and interest coverage ratio declined to 4947.09% from 6486.22%, though still extremely high, indicating strong ability to cover interest obligations. The current ratio decreased to 130.84% from 147.91%, signaling a slight reduction in liquidity but still comfortable short-term coverage. The effective tax rate decreased marginally to 28.26% from 29.23%, which does not indicate significant tax risk changes. The net cash from financing activities showed a larger outflow of $42,789 million compared to $34,297 million, potentially reflecting increased debt repayments or dividend payments, which could impact liquidity. Overall, financial risk remains low with strong interest coverage and improved leverage, but attention to increased interest expense and financing outflows is warranted. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest moderate risk with some early warning signs. The debt to equity ratio improved to 79.97% from 85.41%, indicating reduced leverage. The current ratio increased to 147.91%, reflecting strong liquidity and ability to cover short-term obligations. Interest expense slightly increased to $849 million from $798 million, but interest coverage ratio remained extremely high at 6486.22%, down from 9192.48%, indicating ample earnings to cover interest costs despite the decline. The effective tax rate rose to 29.23% from 25.95%, which could pressure net income if sustained. The decline in net cash from operations and net profit margin may signal operational risks affecting cash flow sustainability. No significant increases in liabilities or liquidity stress are evident, but the reduced profitability and cash flow warrant monitoring. Overall, Exxon Mobil's financial risk remains low to moderate with strong coverage ratios but some caution due to profitability and cash flow trends. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity remained robust with net cash used in investing increasing slightly to $(19,938) million from $(19,274) million, indicating continued capital expenditure. Net cash from financing activities showed a larger negative cash flow of $(42,789) million compared to $(34,297) million, driven in part by increased dividends paid of $(16,704) million versus $(14,941) million, suggesting a commitment to shareholder returns. Revenue by segment shows growth in Upstream revenue to $37,131 million from $25,574 million, while Energy Products revenue declined slightly to $260,856 million from $268,383 million, indicating a strategic shift or market dynamics affecting segments differently. Geographic revenue shows growth in the United States to $138,657 million from $127,374 million, while Non-U.S. revenue declined to $200,590 million from $207,323 million, which may influence future geographic focus. Stable operational cash flow and continued investment suggest sustainability of cash flows, but margin pressures and increased financing outflows may moderate growth. Overall, Exxon Mobil appears positioned for continued investment and shareholder returns with some segment and geographic shifts influencing future performance. | Exxon Mobil's future financial performance appears cautiously optimistic but challenged by lower revenue and profitability in 2023. Increased net cash used in investing activities ($19,274 million vs. $14,742 million) suggests ongoing capital expenditures and investment in growth or maintenance, which may support future earnings. Stable dividend payments around $14,941 million indicate a commitment to shareholder returns, supported by positive though reduced operating cash flow. Revenue declines across all major product segments and geographic regions, especially in Upstream and Non-U.S. markets, may constrain near-term growth. However, the strong asset base, improved equity, and manageable liabilities provide a solid foundation. The company’s ability to sustain cash flow and manage costs will be critical. Segment and geographic revenue declines highlight potential areas for strategic focus or risk mitigation. Overall, Exxon Mobil is positioned to maintain financial stability with ongoing investments and dividends but faces headwinds that may temper growth and profitability in the near term. |
