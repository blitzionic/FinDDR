# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Exxon Mobil's revenue declined from $398,675 million in 2022 to $334,697 million in 2023 and further to $339,247 million in 2024, indicating a significant drop in 2023 with a slight recovery in 2024. Correspondingly, the gross margin decreased from 31.92% in 2022 to 31.33% in 2023 and further to 29.53% in 2024, reflecting pressure on profitability at the gross profit level. In 2024, revenue was predominantly driven by the Upstream segment at $339,136 million, with Energy Products contributing $260,856 million, Chemical Products $22,896 million, and Specialty Products $18,253 million. Geographically, U.S. revenue was $138,657 million in 2024, down from $149,225 million in 2022, while Non-U.S. revenue decreased from $249,450 million in 2022 to $200,590 million in 2024, indicating a contraction in both domestic and international markets over the period. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined steadily from 18.27% in 2022 to 16.83% in 2023 and further to 14.67% in 2024, signaling reduced operating profitability. Operating income decreased from $72,854 million in 2022 to $56,323 million in 2023 and then to $49,773 million in 2024, while revenue also declined, but operating expenses remained relatively stable at $54,411 million in 2022, $48,450 million in 2023, and $50,411 million in 2024. This suggests that cost management efforts were only partially effective as operating expenses did not decrease proportionally with revenue, contributing to margin compression. The ratio of operating income to revenue confirms this trend, with operating income falling faster than revenue, highlighting challenges in maintaining operating efficiency amid declining sales. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 25.95% in 2022 to 29.23% in 2023 and slightly decreased to 28.26% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability as income tax expense remained substantial ($20,176 million in 2022, $15,429 million in 2023, and $13,810 million in 2024) despite declining pre-tax income. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, indicating that the observed profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance and tax rate fluctuations rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In fiscal 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation demonstrated a significant increase in total assets, rising from $376,317 million in 2023 to $453,475 million, driven primarily by a substantial growth in non-current assets from $279,708 million to $361,485 million. Total liabilities also increased from $163,779 million to $182,869 million, with both current liabilities and non-current liabilities rising. Shareholders' equity grew markedly from $204,802 million to $263,705 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from $453,927 million to $470,903 million. The current ratio declined from 147.91% to 130.84%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity but remaining above 1. The debt to equity ratio improved from 79.97% to 69.35%, reflecting a stronger capital structure with relatively lower leverage. Overall, Exxon Mobil's financial health in 2024 shows robust asset growth and equity strengthening, with manageable increases in liabilities and a solid liquidity position. | In 2023, Exxon Mobil Corporation demonstrated a stable and slightly improved financial position compared to 2022. Total assets increased modestly from $369,067 million to $376,317 million, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets (from $271,436 million to $279,708 million), while current assets slightly decreased. Total liabilities decreased from $166,594 million to $163,779 million, with reductions in both current liabilities (from $69,045 million to $65,316 million) and a slight increase in non-current liabilities (from $97,549 million to $98,463 million). Shareholders' equity rose from $195,049 million to $204,802 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from $432,860 million to $453,927 million. The current ratio improved from 141.40% to 147.91%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 85.41% to 79.97%, reflecting a modest reduction in leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, Exxon Mobil maintained a solid financial health profile with increased equity base, controlled liabilities, and improved liquidity in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Exxon Mobil's revenue increased modestly from $334,697 million in 2023 to $339,247 million in 2024. However, gross profit declined from $104,873 million to $100,184 million, resulting in a decrease in gross margin from 31.33% to 29.53%. Operating income fell from $56,323 million to $49,773 million, with operating margin contracting from 16.83% to 14.67%. Net profit decreased from $36,010 million to $33,680 million, and net profit margin declined from 10.76% to 9.93%. Return on equity dropped from 18.01% to 14.38%, and return on assets decreased from 9.66% to 8.12%, indicating reduced profitability and earnings quality. The effective tax rate slightly decreased from 29.23% to 28.26%, contributing to a marginally lower tax burden. Overall, while revenue grew slightly, profitability metrics and margins weakened in 2024, signaling pressure on earnings quality. | Exxon Mobil's profitability in 2023 declined compared to 2022. Revenue decreased by approximately 16% from $398,675 million to $334,697 million. Correspondingly, gross profit fell from $127,265 million to $104,873 million, with the gross margin slightly contracting from 31.92% to 31.33%. Operating income dropped from $72,854 million to $56,323 million, and the operating margin decreased from 18.27% to 16.83%. Net profit declined significantly by about 35% from $55,740 million to $36,010 million, with the net profit margin falling from 13.98% to 10.76%. Income before taxes also decreased from $77,753 million to $52,783 million, while the effective tax rate increased from 25.95% to 29.23%, which negatively impacted net earnings. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 18.01% and 9.66%, respectively, indicating reasonable returns despite the profit decline. Overall, earnings quality weakened in 2023 due to lower revenues and higher tax rates, though profitability remained solid. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost of goods sold increased from $229,824 million in 2023 to $239,063 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and contributing to the decline in gross profit. Operating expenses rose from $48,450 million to $50,411 million, indicating higher operating costs. Asset turnover decreased from 89.81% to 81.77%, reflecting less efficient utilization of assets to generate sales. Net cash from operations remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from $55,369 million to $55,022 million, suggesting steady operational cash generation despite margin pressures. Inventories decreased from $20,528 million to $19,444 million, which may indicate improved inventory management or reduced stock levels. Overall, Exxon Mobil experienced some erosion in operational efficiency in 2024, with higher costs and lower asset turnover, but maintained stable cash flow from operations. | Operational efficiency in 2023 showed mixed results. Cost of goods sold decreased from $271,410 million to $229,824 million, reflecting cost control aligned with lower revenue. Operating expenses also declined from $54,411 million to $48,450 million, indicating effective expense management. Asset turnover was reported at 89.81%, suggesting strong utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations dropped significantly from $76,797 million in 2022 to $55,369 million in 2023, indicating reduced cash generation capacity. Inventories remained stable, increasing slightly from $20,434 million to $20,528 million, which suggests consistent inventory management. Working capital, inferred from current assets and liabilities, remained healthy with a current ratio improvement. Cash flow from investing activities showed increased outflows (from -$14,742 million to -$19,274 million), indicating higher investment spending. Financing cash outflows decreased slightly. Overall, Exxon Mobil maintained operational efficiency with controlled costs and strong asset utilization, but cash flow from operations weakened notably in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators improved as the debt to equity ratio declined from 79.97% in 2023 to 69.35% in 2024, reducing financial risk. However, interest expense increased from $849 million to $996 million, and interest coverage ratio decreased from an extremely high 6634.04% to 4997.29%, though still indicating very strong ability to cover interest obligations. The current ratio fell from 147.91% to 130.84%, signaling a slight reduction in liquidity but remaining healthy. The effective tax rate decreased marginally, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment but does not indicate increased risk. No other explicit risk indicators are present. Overall, Exxon Mobil's financial risk profile in 2024 shows reduced leverage and strong interest coverage, with minor liquidity tightening but no immediate warning signs. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 suggest a moderate risk profile with some early warning signs. The debt to equity ratio improved to 79.97% from 85.41%, indicating reduced leverage. Interest expense increased slightly from $798 million to $849 million, but interest coverage ratio remained extremely high at 6634.04%, down from 9129.57% in 2022, still reflecting a very strong ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate rose from 25.95% to 29.23%, which could pressure net profitability. Liquidity improved as shown by the current ratio increase to 147.91%. However, the significant decline in net cash from operations and the reduced net profit margin may signal potential cash flow stress if trends continue. No drastic changes in liabilities or equity suggest no immediate solvency concerns. Overall, Exxon Mobil's financial risk remains low to moderate, but the decline in operational cash flow and profitability warrants monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Exxon Mobil's net cash from investing activities slightly increased in outflow from $(19,274) million in 2023 to $(19,938) million in 2024, indicating sustained investment activity likely aimed at growth or asset expansion. Net cash from financing activities showed a larger outflow, increasing from $(34,297) million to $(42,789) million, driven in part by higher dividend payments rising from $(14,941) million to $(16,704) million, reflecting a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. The net decrease in cash of $(8,381) million in 2024 contrasts with a net increase in 2023, suggesting tighter cash flow management may be needed. Segment revenue data for 2024 shows strong contributions from Upstream ($339,136 million), Energy Products ($260,856 million), Chemical Products ($22,896 million), and Specialty Products ($18,253 million), indicating diversified revenue streams. Geographic revenue remains heavily weighted towards non-U.S. markets ($200,590 million) compared to U.S. ($88,067 million). These factors suggest Exxon Mobil is maintaining robust investment and dividend policies with diversified operations, but cash flow sustainability may require monitoring given the cash decrease in 2024. | Looking ahead, Exxon Mobil's future financial performance in 2023 shows cautious optimism tempered by some challenges. The company increased net cash outflows from investing activities to -$19,274 million, up from -$14,742 million in 2022, indicating ongoing or increased capital expenditures which may support future growth. Dividend payments remained stable at approximately -$14,941 million, reflecting a consistent dividend policy and commitment to shareholder returns. The modest increase in non-current assets and retained earnings supports potential for sustained asset base growth. However, the significant reduction in net cash from operations and lower revenue base may constrain free cash flow availability in the near term. Geographic revenue data shows a decline in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, with non-U.S. revenue dropping more sharply, which could impact future segment performance. Without detailed segment data, it is difficult to pinpoint growth drivers, but the company’s strong capital structure and investment activity suggest it is positioning for recovery or expansion. Overall, Exxon Mobil appears to be investing for future performance while maintaining dividend stability, but cash flow sustainability and revenue challenges require close attention. |
