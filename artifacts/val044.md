| Financial risk identification and early warning | In 2024, financial risk increased significantly, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 121.22%, up from 71.07% in 2023, indicating higher leverage and potential solvency concerns. The current ratio dropped to 628.78%, suggesting liquidity risks as current liabilities surged. The interest coverage ratio remained high at 736.31%, indicating the ability to cover interest expenses, but the overall financial risk profile is concerning due to rising debt levels and declining equity. | In 2023, the company maintained a manageable financial risk profile with a debt-to-equity ratio of 71.07%, indicating a balanced approach to leverage. The current ratio was strong at 1042.08%, suggesting good liquidity and the ability to meet short-term obligations. The interest coverage ratio was 337.25%, indicating a comfortable ability to service debt. Overall, the financial risk was relatively low, but increasing liabilities were a potential concern for future stability. |
| Future financial performance projection | Based on the 2024 data, future financial performance appears bleak, with significant losses and declining profitability trends. The company may need to reassess its operational strategies and cost structures to regain profitability. Investment activities are likely to be constrained due to cash flow challenges, and market expansion may be limited unless financial health improves. The focus should be on stabilizing cash flows and managing liabilities to ensure sustainability. | In 2023, the company showed potential for future growth despite declining profitability. The positive cash flow from operations and manageable debt levels suggest that with strategic investments and cost management, the company could stabilize and potentially expand. However, the declining trend in profitability must be addressed to ensure long-term sustainability and market competitiveness. |
