# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 was significant, increasing from $92,870 to $106,374, representing a growth of approximately 14.5%. However, the growth continued into 2024, with revenue reaching $117,761, marking a further increase of about 10.5%. The gross margin has shown a declining trend, decreasing from 18.50% in 2022 to 16.90% in 2023, and further down to 14.52% in 2024, indicating rising costs relative to revenue. In terms of product/service revenue, the Individual Medicare Advantage segment saw substantial growth from $65,591 in 2022 to $88,019 in 2024, while the Group Medicare Advantage also increased from $7,297 to $7,731. The total Medicare revenue grew from $75,157 in 2022 to $98,887 in 2024. The geographic revenue distribution data is not available, limiting insights into regional performance. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin has been on a downward trend, decreasing from 4.09% in 2022 to 3.77% in 2023, and further to 2.18% in 2024. This decline suggests that while revenue has increased, operating expenses have risen at a faster rate, leading to reduced profitability. Operating income has fluctuated, with a slight increase from $3,800 in 2022 to $4,013 in 2023, but a significant drop to $2,562 in 2024, indicating challenges in cost management and operational efficiency. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that despite higher revenues, the effectiveness of cost management has deteriorated. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate has increased from 21.36% in 2022 to 24.71% in 2023, and slightly decreased to 24.00% in 2024. This increase in the tax rate could have negatively impacted net profits, which have declined from $2,802 in 2022 to $2,484 in 2023, and further to $1,214 in 2024. There are no specific non-recurring items mentioned, but the overall decline in profitability suggests that external factors, possibly including market conditions or regulatory changes, may be affecting the company's financial performance. |
