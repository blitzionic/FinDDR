# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue showed a consistent upward trend from 2022 to 2024, increasing from $92,870 million in 2022 to $106,374 million in 2023 (14.56% growth), and further to $117,761 million in 2024 (10.67% growth). Gross margin data is not available, limiting direct analysis of cost of goods sold impact. Revenue by product/service reveals that Medicare-related revenues dominate, growing from $75,157 million in 2022 to $87,895 million in 2023 (16.95% increase), and $98,887 million in 2024 (12.52% increase). Individual Medicare Advantage is the largest contributor within Medicare, rising from $65,591 million in 2022 to $78,837 million in 2023 (20.18% growth), and $88,019 million in 2024 (11.66% growth). Commercial fully-insured revenue declined significantly from $4,389 million in 2022 to $3,527 million in 2023 (19.66% decrease), and further to $501 million in 2024 (85.79% decrease), indicating a strategic shift or market contraction in this segment. Specialty benefits and Medicare Supplement revenues also declined slightly over the period. State-based contracts and other revenues increased notably from $6,376 million in 2022 to $8,108 million in 2023 (27.14% growth), and $10,915 million in 2024 (34.68% growth), suggesting expansion in this area. External services revenue decreased from $3,926 million in 2022 to $3,033 million in 2023 (22.75% decrease), then slightly increased to $3,465 million in 2024 (14.27% increase). Geographic revenue data is not provided, preventing regional distribution analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin has declined steadily from 4.09% in 2022 to 3.77% in 2023, and further to 2.18% in 2024, indicating deteriorating operating efficiency. Operating income decreased from $3,800 million in 2022 to $4,013 million in 2023 (5.61% increase), but then dropped sharply to $2,562 million in 2024 (36.17% decrease), despite revenue growth, highlighting margin compression. Operating expenses rose significantly from $89,070 million in 2022 to $102,361 million in 2023 (14.89% increase), and $115,199 million in 2024 (12.56% increase), outpacing revenue growth and contributing to margin decline. This suggests challenges in cost management and operational efficiency, as expenses are growing faster than revenues, eroding profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 21.36% in 2022 to 24.71% in 2023, then slightly decreased to 24.00% in 2024. This rise in tax rate between 2022 and 2023 likely contributed to reduced net profit margins. Income tax expense increased from $762 million in 2022 to $836 million in 2023 (9.71% increase), then decreased to $413 million in 2024 (50.60% decrease), consistent with lower operating income in 2024. Net profit margin declined from 3.02% in 2022 to 2.34% in 2023, and further to 1.03% in 2024, reflecting combined effects of rising expenses and tax rate changes. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability cannot be assessed due to lack of geographic revenue and external environment data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company maintained a relatively stable total asset base with a slight decrease from $47,065 million in 2023 to $46,479 million. Current assets also saw a marginal decline from $29,986 million to $29,815 million. Total liabilities decreased from $30,747 million to $30,034 million, reflecting effective liability management. Current liabilities reduced notably from $18,872 million to $16,939 million, improving short-term financial stability. Shareholders' equity increased slightly from $16,262 million to $16,375 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from $27,540 million to $28,317 million, indicating reinvestment of profits. The current ratio improved from 158.89% to 176.01%, signaling enhanced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 189.07% to 183.41%, suggesting a modest reduction in leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a stable financial position with prudent liability management and improved liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated moderate asset growth with total assets increasing from $43,055 million in 2022 to $47,065 million, reflecting a 9.4% increase. Total liabilities also rose from $27,685 million to $30,747 million, a 11.1% increase, slightly outpacing asset growth. Shareholders' equity improved from $15,311 million to $16,262 million, a 6.3% increase, indicating a strengthening equity base but at a slower pace than liabilities. The current ratio improved from 152.42% to 158.89%, suggesting enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased from 180.82% to 189.07%, indicating a higher leverage position. Overall, the balance sheet shows growth in assets and equity but with a rising leverage profile and maintained liquidity, reflecting a stable but cautiously leveraged financial position in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased significantly by approximately 10.7%, from $106,374 million in 2023 to $117,761 million in 2024, indicating strong top-line growth. However, profitability declined as operating income dropped from $4,013 million to $2,562 million, and net profit fell sharply from $2,484 million to $1,214 million. Correspondingly, operating margin decreased from 3.77% to 2.18%, and net profit margin halved from 2.34% to 1.03%, reflecting margin compression and reduced earnings quality. Return on equity (ROE) declined substantially from 15.73% to 7.44%, and return on assets (ROA) dropped from 5.51% to 2.60%, indicating lower efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets. The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from 24.71% to 24.00%. The decline in profitability despite revenue growth suggests increased costs or operational challenges impacting earnings sustainability in 2024. | Revenue increased significantly by 14.6% from $92,870 million in 2022 to $106,374 million in 2023, indicating strong top-line growth. Operating income rose slightly from $3,800 million to $4,013 million, a 5.6% increase, but operating margin declined from 4.09% to 3.77%, reflecting increased operating expenses which grew from $89,070 million to $102,361 million. Net profit decreased by 11.3% from $2,802 million to $2,484 million, with net profit margin declining from 3.02% to 2.34%, indicating margin compression and lower earnings quality. Return on equity was 15.73% and return on assets was 5.51% in 2023, showing reasonable returns but no prior year data for comparison. The effective tax rate increased from 21.36% to 24.71%, contributing to lower net income. Overall, while revenue growth was robust, profitability margins and net earnings quality weakened in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased significantly from $102,361 million in 2023 to $115,199 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and contributing to reduced operating income. The asset turnover ratio improved from 236.07% to 251.78%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations declined from $3,981 million to $2,966 million, reflecting weaker cash generation despite higher sales. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supported by an improved current ratio. The operating margin contraction to 2.18% highlights challenges in cost control. Overall, while asset utilization improved, cost management and cash flow generation weakened, signaling operational efficiency pressures in 2024. | Operating expenses increased substantially by 14.9%, outpacing revenue growth, which led to a decline in operating margin to 3.77% from 4.09% in 2022, indicating some erosion in cost control efficiency. Asset turnover was very high at 236.07%, suggesting strong utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased from $4,587 million to $3,981 million, a 13.2% decline, which may indicate some challenges in converting earnings into cash. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, reflected in the improved current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency shows strong asset utilization but weakening cost control and cash flow generation in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators show a slight improvement with the debt to equity ratio decreasing from 189.07% to 183.41%, reducing financial risk marginally. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio rising from 158.89% to 176.01%, enhancing short-term solvency. Interest expense increased from $493 million to $660 million, while interest coverage ratio declined sharply from 814.00% to 388.18%, indicating reduced ability to cover interest obligations comfortably. The effective tax rate remained stable, suggesting no significant tax-related risk changes. The decline in interest coverage and net profit margin signals increased financial risk and potential early warning signs related to profitability and debt servicing capacity in 2024. | Leverage increased as indicated by the debt to equity ratio rising from 180.82% to 189.07%, signaling higher financial risk. Interest expense increased from $401 million to $493 million, and interest coverage ratio declined from 947.63% to 814.00%, though still very strong, indicating the company remains comfortably able to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased to 24.71% from 21.36%, which could pressure net income. Liquidity remains solid with an improved current ratio of 158.89%. No data on non-current liabilities or inventories limits full risk assessment. Overall, financial risk increased moderately due to higher leverage and interest expense, but liquidity and interest coverage remain strong. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities showed a reduction in net cash used in investing from $(3,492) million in 2023 to $(2,952) million in 2024, indicating a moderation in capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities saw a larger outflow, increasing from $(856) million to $(2,487) million, possibly reflecting higher debt repayments or dividend payments, though dividends remained constant at $(431) million. The net decrease in cash deepened from $(367) million to $(2,473) million, raising concerns about cash flow sustainability. Revenue growth across key insurance segments, especially Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts, suggests positive market trends. However, declining profitability and cash flow generation may constrain future growth unless operational efficiencies improve. The company’s dividend policy remained stable, supporting shareholder returns despite earnings pressure. Overall, growth prospects appear positive but contingent on addressing profitability and cash flow challenges. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 with net cash used in investing increasing significantly from $(1,006) million to $(3,492) million, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing improved from $(1,914) million to $(856) million, suggesting reduced financing outflows. Dividends increased slightly from $(392) million to $(431) million, reflecting a stable or slightly more generous dividend policy. Revenue growth was driven primarily by increases in Individual Medicare Advantage and State-based contracts, while external services revenue declined, indicating potential shifts in business mix. The decline in net cash from operations and net decrease in cash by $367 million raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company is investing heavily for growth with stable dividend payments but needs to monitor cash flow generation closely to support future financial performance. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The company operates primarily through two reportable segments: Insurance and CenterWell. The Insurance segment generates revenue mainly from premiums for Medicare benefits marketed to individuals and groups, state-based Medicaid and dual eligible contracts, employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, administrative services only (ASO) fees, military services contracts, and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) operations. Premiums revenue accounted for the majority of revenue, with $112.1 billion in 2024, representing 96.2% of the segment's total external revenues. The CenterWell segment includes pharmacy solutions (mail-order, specialty, and retail pharmacies), primary care services (including value-based arrangements with health plans), and home solutions operations. CenterWell generates revenue from both intersegment sales to the Insurance segment and external services revenue, totaling $19.9 billion in 2024, with $3.5 billion from external services. Revenue recognition varies by product: premiums are recognized ratably over the service period; pharmacy revenues are transaction-based; primary care revenues include per-member per-month premiums under value-based contracts and fee-for-service; home solutions revenues are recognized as services are rendered. The company also engages in value-based care delivery models, integrating quality care, member engagement, and data analytics to improve health outcomes and reduce costs. The business model is thus a combination of insurance premium revenue, service fees, and integrated healthcare services including pharmacy, primary care, and home health solutions, with a focus on value-based care and risk-sharing arrangements with providers. | The company operates primarily through two distinct segments: Insurance and CenterWell. The Insurance segment generates revenue mainly from premiums related to Medicare benefits (including individual and group Medicare Advantage, Medicare stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans, and Medicare Supplement), state-based contracts (Medicaid, dual eligible demonstration, and Long-Term Support Services), commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits (including dental, vision, and other supplemental benefits), administrative services only (ASO) fees, military services contracts, and operations of the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) business. The CenterWell segment generates revenue from healthcare services including pharmacy solutions (mail-order, specialty, and retail pharmacies), primary care, and home solutions (home health and hospice services). CenterWell also earns intersegment revenues from services provided to the Insurance segment and external services revenue from third parties. Revenue recognition includes premiums from government and commercial contracts, service fees from administrative services, and value-based arrangements primarily on a per-member per-month basis. The company’s integrated care delivery model focuses on uniting quality care, member engagement, and data analytics to improve health outcomes and affordability. Approximately 84% of total premiums and services revenue in 2023 were derived from federal government contracts, highlighting a significant reliance on Medicare and Medicaid programs. The company also engages in value-based care arrangements with providers, including capitation contracts where providers assume financial risk for defined membership groups. |
| Market Position | The company is a significant player in the U.S. health benefits industry, serving approximately 16 million members in medical benefit plans and 5 million in specialty products as of December 31, 2024. It holds a strong position in Medicare Advantage, with 5.66 million individual Medicare Advantage members, including 924,800 in Florida alone, representing about 14% of consolidated premiums and services revenue. The company is a market leader in Medicare Advantage, with 71% of its individual Medicare Advantage members in value-based relationships, indicating a competitive advantage in integrated care delivery. The company also holds substantial contracts with CMS and various state Medicaid programs, with approximately 85% of total premiums and services revenue derived from federal government contracts. The company faces intense competition from other managed care companies, national insurers, HMOs, and PPOs, many of which have larger membership bases or greater financial resources. The company is exiting the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business, indicating a strategic focus on Medicare and government-related markets. The company’s military services business covers approximately 6 million TRICARE beneficiaries, with a new contract covering 4.6 million beneficiaries starting in 2025. While specific market share percentages are not provided, the company’s large membership base, significant government contract revenue (85%), and leadership in Medicare Advantage position it as a market leader and a major competitor in its key markets. | The company is a significant player in the U.S. health benefits industry, serving approximately 17 million members in medical benefit plans and 5 million in specialty products as of December 31, 2023. It holds a strong market position in Medicare Advantage, with 5,408,900 individual Medicare Advantage members (an 18.5% increase from 2022), representing 74.9% of consolidated premiums and services revenue. The company also has substantial membership in state-based contracts and military services (TRICARE), with 5,960,200 military services members representing 35.3% of total membership. The company is a market leader in individual Medicare Advantage, with approximately 70% of its individual Medicare Advantage members in value-based relationships under its integrated care delivery model. The company faces intense competition from other managed care companies, national insurance companies, and HMOs/PPOs, many of which have larger membership bases or greater financial resources. The company is exiting the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business, reflecting a strategic shift away from certain commercial markets. Specific market share percentages beyond membership counts are not provided, but the company’s scale, government contract reliance (84% of premiums and services revenue), and integrated care model position it as a leading competitor in Medicare Advantage and related healthcare services markets. |


# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The company faces significant market risks including intense competition in the health benefits and pharmacy industries from larger and financially stronger competitors, new entrants, and evolving customer preferences. Market risks also arise from volatility in securities and credit markets, including interest rate fluctuations that adversely affect the value of the investment portfolio and investment income.
