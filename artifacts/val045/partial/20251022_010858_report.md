# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue increased from $92,870m in 2022 to $106,374m in 2023 (14.56% growth), and further to $117,761m in 2024 (10.67% growth). However, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) rose at a faster pace, from $75,690m in 2022 to $88,394m in 2023 (16.79% increase), and then to $100,664m in 2024 (13.91% increase). This led to a decline in gross profit from $17,180m in 2022 to $17,980m in 2023 (+4.67%), but a slight decrease to $17,097m in 2024 (-4.92%). Consequently, the gross margin contracted from 18.50% in 2022 to 16.90% in 2023 and further to 14.52% in 2024, indicating margin pressure likely due to rising direct costs outpacing revenue growth. Examining revenue by product/service, Individual Medicare Advantage showed strong growth from $65,591m in 2022 to $78,837m in 2023 (+20.18%) and $88,019m in 2024 (+11.66%), remaining the dominant revenue driver. Group Medicare Advantage revenue was relatively stable, slightly decreasing from $7,297m in 2022 to $6,869m in 2023 (-5.85%) and then increasing to $7,731m in 2024 (+12.53%). Medicare stand-alone PDP revenue declined from $2,269m in 2022 to $2,189m in 2023 (-3.53%) but rebounded to $3,137m in 2024 (+43.33%). Total Medicare revenue grew significantly from $75,157m in 2022 to $87,895m in 2023 (+16.95%) and $98,887m in 2024 (+12.48%). Commercial fully-insured revenue declined sharply from $4,389m in 2022 to $3,527m in 2023 (-19.66%) and further to $501m in 2024 (-85.79%), indicating a strategic shift or market contraction in this segment. State-based contracts and other revenue increased from $6,376m in 2022 to $8,108m in 2023 (+27.15%) and $10,915m in 2024 (+34.67%), showing strong growth in this category. Total external revenues rose from $88,562m in 2022 to $102,272m in 2023 (+15.44%) and $113,070m in 2024 (+10.58%). Geographic revenue data was not available for analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from $3,800m in 2022 to $4,013m in 2023 (+5.61%) but declined to $2,562m in 2024 (-36.17%). Operating margin followed a similar trend, decreasing from 4.09% in 2022 to 3.77% in 2023 and sharply to 2.18% in 2024, reflecting deteriorating operating efficiency. Despite revenue growth, operating expenses rose substantially from $89,070m in 2022 to $102,361m in 2023 (+14.87%) and $115,199m in 2024 (+12.56%), outpacing revenue increases and compressing margins. The relationship between operating income and revenue weakened in 2024, indicating cost management challenges. The company's cost management effectiveness appears to have declined, as operating expenses grew faster than revenue, eroding profitability despite higher sales volumes. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 21.36% in 2022 to 24.71% in 2023 and slightly decreased to 24.00% in 2024. This rise in tax rate contributed to a reduction in net profit margins, which fell from 3.02% in 2022 to 2.34% in 2023 and further to 1.03% in 2024. Income tax expense decreased from $762m in 2022 to $836m in 2023 (+9.71%) but dropped significantly to $413m in 2024 (-50.48%), consistent with lower pre-tax profits. Net profit declined from $2,802m in 2022 to $2,484m in 2023 (-11.32%) and further to $1,214m in 2024 (-51.12%), reflecting the combined impact of margin compression, higher tax rates, and increased costs. There were no explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns reported in the data. External factors affecting profitability may include rising direct costs and operating expenses, but no specific external events were detailed. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company maintained a relatively stable total asset base with a slight decrease from $47,065 million in 2023 to $46,479 million. Current assets marginally decreased from $29,986 million to $29,815 million, while non-current assets also declined from $17,079 million to $16,664 million. Total liabilities decreased from $30,747 million to $30,034 million, driven by a reduction in current liabilities from $18,872 million to $16,939 million, although non-current liabilities increased from $11,875 million to $13,095 million. Shareholders' equity slightly increased from $16,262 million to $16,375 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from $27,540 million to $28,317 million. Liquidity improved as indicated by the current ratio rising from 158.89% to 176.01%, reflecting stronger short-term asset coverage of liabilities. The debt to equity ratio improved slightly from 189.07% to 183.41%, indicating a modest reduction in leverage relative to equity. Overall, the balance sheet shows a stable financial position with moderate liability management and a solid equity base, supported by improved liquidity metrics in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated moderate asset growth with total assets increasing from $43,055 million in 2022 to $47,065 million, reflecting a 9.4% increase.

Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, improved slightly from 152.42% to 158.89%, indicating a stronger short-term financial position. However, the debt to equity ratio increased from 180.82% to 189.07%, suggesting a higher leverage level. Overall, the balance sheet shows growth in assets and equity but also an increase in liabilities, indicating a need to monitor leverage carefully. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased significantly by approximately 10.7%, from $106,374 million in 2023 to $117,761 million in 2024. However, gross profit declined from $17,980 million to $17,097 million, resulting in a gross margin contraction from 16.90% to 14.52%. Operating income decreased sharply from $4,013 million to $2,562 million, with operating margin falling from 3.77% to 2.18%. Net profit halved from $2,484 million to $1,214 million, and net profit margin dropped from 2.34% to 1.03%. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) also deteriorated significantly, with ROE declining from 15.73% to 7.44% and ROA from 5.51% to 2.60%, indicating reduced earnings quality and sustainability. The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from 24.71% to 24.00%. Overall, despite revenue growth, profitability and earnings quality worsened in 2024 due to rising costs and compressed margins. | Revenue increased significantly by 14.6% from $92,870 million in 2022 to $106,374 million in 2023, driven primarily by growth in Individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts. Gross profit rose modestly by 4.7% to $17,980 million, but gross margin declined from 18.50% to 16.90%, indicating increased cost pressures. Operating income increased slightly by 5.6% to $4,013 million, but operating margin decreased from 4.09% to 3.77%. Net profit declined by 11.3% to $2,484 million, with net profit margin falling from 3.02% to 2.34%. Return on equity was 15.73% and return on assets was 5.51%, reflecting moderate earnings quality and returns. The effective tax rate increased from 21.36% to 24.71%, which contributed to lower net profitability. Overall, while revenue growth was strong, profitability margins and net earnings quality weakened in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased substantially from $102,361 million in 2023 to $115,199 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and contributing to margin compression. The operating margin declined from 3.77% to 2.18%, reflecting less effective cost control. Asset turnover improved from 236.07% to 251.78%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased from $3,981 million to $2,966 million, signaling reduced cash generation efficiency. Working capital position improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, reflected in the higher current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed results: improved asset utilization but weaker cost control and lower operational cash flow generation in 2024. | Operating expenses increased by 14.9% to $102,361 million, outpacing revenue growth and pressuring operating margins. The operating margin declined to 3.77% from 4.09% in 2022, indicating less efficient cost control. Asset turnover was high at 236.07%, suggesting effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations decreased by 13.2% to $3,981 million, indicating some challenges in converting earnings into cash flow. Working capital improved slightly as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency showed mixed results with strong asset utilization but rising costs and reduced cash flow from operations. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage indicators show a slight improvement with the debt to equity ratio decreasing from 189.07% to 183.41%, but the company remains highly leveraged. Liquidity improved as the current ratio increased from 158.89% to 176.01%, indicating stronger short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased from $493 million to $660 million, while interest coverage ratio declined sharply from 814.00% to 388.18%, signaling reduced ability to cover interest costs comfortably. The effective tax rate remained stable around 24%. The decline in interest coverage and increased interest expense represent early warning signs of rising financial risk, despite improved liquidity and stable leverage ratios. | Leverage increased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio rising to 189.07% from 180.82%, indicating higher financial risk. Interest expense increased by 22.9% to $493 million, while interest coverage ratio declined from 947.63% to 814.00%, though still at a comfortable level, suggesting the company remains capable of meeting interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased to 24.71%, which may impact net profitability. Liquidity improved slightly with a current ratio of 158.89%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. However, the decline in net cash from operations and increased investing outflows raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. Overall, financial risk has moderately increased due to higher leverage and interest costs, but liquidity remains adequate. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a slight reduction in net cash used in investing from $(3,492) million in 2023 to $(2,952) million in 2024, indicating continued but moderated capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities showed a larger outflow, increasing from $(856) million to $(2,487) million, which may reflect higher debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends remained constant at $(431) million, suggesting a stable dividend policy despite lower earnings. The decline in net cash from operations and increased financing outflows, combined with shrinking profitability margins, may pressure future cash flow sustainability. Revenue growth was driven by increases in key segments such as Individual Medicare Advantage (from $78,837 million to $88,019 million) and State-based contracts and other (from $8,108 million to $10,915 million), indicating growth opportunities in these areas. However, commercial fully-insured revenue declined significantly, which may require strategic attention. Overall, future performance may face challenges from profitability and cash flow pressures, but growth in core Medicare segments provides a positive outlook for revenue expansion. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 with net cash used in investing increasing substantially to $(3,492) million from $(1,006) million in 2022, indicating aggressive capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Financing cash outflows decreased to $(856) million from $(1,914) million, and dividends paid increased slightly to $(431) million, reflecting a stable dividend policy. The decline in net cash from operations and negative net cash flow overall (net decrease in cash of $(367) million) suggest potential challenges in cash flow sustainability if operational cash generation does not improve. Revenue growth in key segments such as Individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts indicates positive market trends. However, margin pressures and increased costs may constrain future profitability. The company should monitor cash flow closely to support ongoing investments and dividend commitments. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The company operates primarily through two reportable segments: Insurance and CenterWell. The Insurance segment generates revenue mainly from premiums for Medicare benefits marketed to individuals and groups, state-based Medicaid and dual eligible contracts, employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, administrative services only (ASO) fees, military services contracts, and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) operations. Premiums revenue accounted for the majority of revenue, with $112.1 billion in premiums revenue in 2024, representing 96.2% of the Insurance segment's total external revenues. The CenterWell segment generates revenue from pharmacy solutions (including mail-order and specialty pharmacies), primary care services (including value-based arrangements with health plans), and home solutions operations. CenterWell also includes strategic partnerships to develop senior-focused, payor-agnostic primary care centers and minority ownership in hospice operations. CenterWell's services revenue was $3.5 billion in 2024, representing 3.0% of consolidated premiums and services revenue. The company uses an integrated care delivery model combining insurance products with healthcare services to improve member health outcomes and reduce costs. Revenue recognition includes premiums from government contracts (approximately 85% of total premiums and services revenue), fees for administrative services, and value-based care premiums paid on a per-member per-month basis. The company also earns intersegment revenues primarily from CenterWell services sold to Insurance segment customers. The business model focuses on Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, specialty products, and value-based care delivery, with a strategic exit planned from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business by mid-2025. | The company operates primarily through two distinct segments: Insurance and CenterWell. The Insurance segment generates revenue mainly from premiums related to Medicare benefits (including individual and group Medicare Advantage, Medicare stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans, Medicare Supplement), state-based contracts (Medicaid, dual eligible demonstration, Long-Term Support Services), commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, administrative services only (ASO) fees, military services contracts, and the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) business. Premiums revenue is recognized based on membership covered and contractual rates, with a significant portion (approximately 84% in 2023) derived from federal government contracts, including CMS. The CenterWell segment generates revenue from healthcare services including pharmacy solutions (mail-order, specialty, and retail pharmacies), primary care, and home solutions. This segment also includes strategic partnerships to operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic primary care centers and minority ownership in hospice operations. Revenue in CenterWell is recognized from services rendered, including value-based arrangements with health plans where premiums are typically paid on a per-member per-month basis, and fee-for-service revenues. Intersegment sales primarily consist of CenterWell services sold to Insurance segment customers. The company’s integrated care delivery model focuses on uniting quality care, member engagement, and data analytics to improve health outcomes and affordability. The company also offers administrative services fees for processing claims and providing access to provider networks for self-funded groups. Overall, revenue generation is a mix of insurance premiums, service fees, and healthcare services with a strong emphasis on government contracts and value-based care models. |
