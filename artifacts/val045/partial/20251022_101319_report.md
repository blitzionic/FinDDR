# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Humana Inc.'s revenue showed a consistent upward trend from 2022 to 2024, increasing from $92,870 million in 2022 to $106,374 million in 2023, and further to $117,761 million in 2024. Despite this growth, the gross margin declined from 18.50% in 2022 to 16.90% in 2023 and further to 14.52% in 2024, indicating rising cost pressures relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service reveals that the Insurance segment premiums revenue grew significantly from $87,712 million in 2022 to $112,104 million in 2024, while Insurance segment services revenue remained relatively stable around $850-$1,000 million. The CenterWell segment external services revenue decreased from $3,926 million in 2022 to $3,033 million in 2023 but rebounded to $3,465 million in 2024, with notable contributions from Home solutions, Pharmacy solutions, and Primary care. Geographic revenue data shows a high dependency on federal government contracts, accounting for approximately 82% of premium and services revenues in 2022 and increasing slightly to 84% in 2023, underscoring the importance of government-related revenue streams. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined steadily from 4.09% in 2022 to 3.77% in 2023 and further to 2.18% in 2024, reflecting decreasing operating efficiency. Operating income decreased from $3,800 million in 2022 to $4,013 million in 2023 but then dropped sharply to $2,562 million in 2024, despite revenue growth, indicating rising operating expenses. Operating expenses increased from $89,070 million in 2022 to $102,361 million in 2023 and further to $115,199 million in 2024, outpacing revenue growth and pressuring margins. This suggests challenges in cost management, as expenses grew by approximately 29% over the three years compared to a 27% increase in revenue, highlighting the need for improved operational controls to sustain profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 21.36% in 2022 to 24.71% in 2023 and slightly decreased to 24.00% in 2024, contributing to a reduction in net profit margins from 3.02% in 2022 to 2.34% in 2023 and further to 1.03% in 2024. Income tax expense rose from $762 million in 2022 to $836 million in 2023 before declining to $413 million in 2024, reflecting the interplay of taxable income and tax rate changes. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, indicating that the observed profitability trends are primarily driven by operational and tax-related dynamics rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Humana Inc. maintained a relatively stable total asset base at $46,479 million, slightly down from $47,065 million in 2023. Current assets decreased marginally to $29,815 million from $29,986 million, while non-current assets also declined to $16,664 million from $17,079 million. Total liabilities decreased to $30,034 million from $30,747 million, driven by a reduction in current liabilities from $18,872 million to $16,939 million, though non-current liabilities increased to $13,095 million from $11,875 million. Shareholders' equity slightly increased to $16,375 million from $16,262 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings to $28,317 million from $27,540 million. Liquidity improved as reflected by the current ratio rising from 158.89% to 176.01%, indicating stronger short-term financial health. The debt to equity ratio decreased slightly to 183.41% from 189.07%, suggesting a modest improvement in capital structure with slightly less reliance on debt relative to equity. Overall, Humana's financial health in 2024 shows stable asset management, improved liquidity, and a cautiously optimized capital structure despite some shifts in liability composition. | In 2023, Humana Inc. demonstrated growth in total assets, increasing from $43,055 million in 2022 to $47,065 million, reflecting asset expansion. Current assets rose from $26,183 million to $29,986 million, improving liquidity as evidenced by the current ratio increasing from 152.42% to 158.89%, indicating a stronger short-term financial position. Total liabilities also increased from $27,685 million to $30,747 million, with current liabilities rising from $17,178 million to $18,872 million and non-current liabilities from $10,507 million to $11,875 million. Shareholders' equity grew from $15,311 million to $16,262 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from $25,492 million to $27,540 million. The debt to equity ratio increased from 180.82% to 189.07%, suggesting a slight increase in leverage but still maintaining a balanced capital structure. Overall, Humana's financial health in 2023 shows asset growth, improved liquidity, and moderate leverage expansion, supporting a stable capital base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Humana's revenue increased significantly by 10.7% to $117,761 million in 2024 from $106,374 million in 2023, driven primarily by growth in insurance segment premiums revenue and CenterWell segment external services revenue. However, gross profit declined to $17,097 million from $17,980 million, resulting in a lower gross margin of 14.52% compared to 16.90% in 2023, indicating increased cost pressures or pricing challenges. Operating income fell sharply to $2,562 million from $4,013 million, with operating margin contracting to 2.18% from 3.77%. Net profit halved to $1,214 million from $2,484 million, and net profit margin dropped to 1.03% from 2.34%, reflecting significant margin compression. Return on equity and return on assets also declined markedly to 7.44% and 2.60% respectively, down from 15.73% and 5.51%, signaling reduced earnings quality and efficiency in generating returns from equity and assets. The effective tax rate remained relatively stable at 24.00%. Overall, despite revenue growth, profitability and earnings quality deteriorated substantially in 2024 due to rising costs and lower margins. | Humana's revenue increased significantly by approximately 14.6%, from $92,870 million in 2022 to $106,374 million in 2023, driven primarily by growth in insurance segment premiums revenue (from $87,712 million to $101,272 million) and a modest increase in insurance services revenue. However, gross profit only increased marginally from $17,180 million to $17,980 million, causing the gross margin to decline from 18.50% to 16.90%. Operating income rose slightly from $3,800 million to $4,013 million, but the operating margin decreased from 4.09% to 3.77%, indicating rising operating expenses outpacing revenue growth. Net profit declined from $2,802 million to $2,484 million, with net profit margin falling from 3.02% to 2.34%. The effective tax rate increased from 21.36% to 24.71%, contributing to lower net income. Return on equity was 15.73% and return on assets was 5.51% in 2023, indicating reasonable profitability relative to equity and assets. Overall, while revenue growth was strong, profitability margins compressed due to higher costs and tax expenses, signaling some pressure on earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency weakened in 2024 as operating expenses rose sharply to $115,199 million from $102,361 million in 2023, outpacing revenue growth. Cost of goods sold increased to $100,664 million from $88,394 million, contributing to the decline in gross profit. Asset turnover improved to 251.78% from 236.07%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations decreased to $2,966 million from $3,981 million, reflecting potential challenges in converting earnings into cash flow. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supporting liquidity. Net cash used in investing activities was $2,952 million, slightly less than the prior year's $3,492 million, indicating continued investment but at a reduced pace. Net cash used in financing activities increased significantly to $2,487 million from $856 million, driven possibly by higher debt repayments or other financing outflows. Dividends remained steady at $431 million. Overall, while asset utilization improved, cost control weakened and cash flow from operations declined, signaling operational efficiency challenges in 2024. | Cost of goods sold increased from $75,690 million to $88,394 million, a 16.8% rise, outpacing revenue growth and contributing to margin compression. Operating expenses also increased from $89,070 million to $102,361 million, reflecting higher costs. Despite this, operating income improved slightly. Asset turnover was notably high at 236.07%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased from $4,587 million to $3,981 million, suggesting some decline in cash generation efficiency. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supported by an increased current ratio. Net cash used in investing activities increased significantly from $(1,006) million to $(3,492) million, indicating higher investment outflows. Net cash from financing activities improved, with outflows decreasing from $(1,914) million to $(856) million, and dividends paid increased slightly from $(392) million to $(431) million. Overall, operational efficiency shows strong asset utilization but some challenges in cost control and cash flow generation. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show mixed signals in 2024. The debt to equity ratio slightly improved to 183.41% from 189.07%, indicating marginally reduced leverage but still a high reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased to $660 million from $493 million, while interest coverage ratio declined sharply to 388.18% from 814.00%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest obligations comfortably, which could signal rising financial risk. Liquidity improved as the current ratio increased to 176.01% from 158.89%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. The effective tax rate remained stable at 24.00%, indicating no significant tax-related risk changes. The decline in profitability and cash flow from operations, combined with increased interest expense and lower interest coverage, suggest emerging financial risks that require monitoring, particularly related to debt servicing and operational cash generation. | Leverage increased as indicated by the debt to equity ratio rising from 180.82% to 189.07%, reflecting higher liabilities relative to equity. Liquidity improved with the current ratio increasing to 158.89%, suggesting adequate short-term liquidity. Interest expense rose from $401 million to $493 million, while interest coverage decreased from 947.63% to 814.00%, indicating a slight reduction in the company's ability to cover interest expenses comfortably, though coverage remains strong. The effective tax rate increased from 21.36% to 24.71%, which may impact net profitability. The decline in net cash from operations and increased investing outflows could pressure liquidity if sustained. No inventories data is available, limiting assessment of inventory risk. Overall, financial risk indicators suggest moderate leverage increase and slightly reduced interest coverage, but liquidity remains strong with no immediate red flags. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Humana's investment activity in 2024 decreased slightly with net cash used in investing at $2,952 million compared to $3,492 million in 2023, indicating a modest reduction in capital expenditures or acquisitions. The steady dividend payout of $431 million suggests a commitment to returning value to shareholders despite lower earnings. The decline in net cash from operations to $2,966 million raises concerns about cash flow sustainability, which may constrain future investment and dividend capacity if the trend continues. Revenue growth driven by the insurance segment premiums and CenterWell segment external services, particularly in primary care and pharmacy solutions, indicates potential growth areas. However, margin compression and rising costs may limit profitability improvements. Geographic revenue data for 2024 is unavailable, limiting regional growth insights. Overall, future financial performance will depend on managing cost pressures, improving operational cash flow, and leveraging growth in key service segments to sustain investment and shareholder returns. | Humana's increased investing cash outflows from $(1,006) million to $(3,492) million in 2023 indicate heightened investment activity, potentially supporting future growth. The company maintained dividend payments, increasing slightly from $(392) million to $(431) million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns. The decline in net cash from operations and negative net cash flow overall (net decrease in cash of $(367) million) may raise concerns about cash flow sustainability if trends continue. Revenue growth was driven mainly by the insurance segment, with federal government contracts comprising approximately 84% of premium and services revenues, up from 82% in 2022, suggesting continued reliance on government contracts as a key revenue source. The CenterWell segment showed a decrease in external services revenue from $3,926 million to $3,033 million but significant intersegment revenues, indicating internal growth dynamics. Geographic and segment revenue trends suggest stable core markets with potential for expansion in home, pharmacy, and primary care solutions. Overall, investment activity and government contract reliance position Humana for steady future performance, but cash flow trends warrant monitoring. |

| Market Risks | Humana Inc. operates in a highly competitive health benefits industry with competitors varying by local market, including larger managed care companies and national insurers. Market risks include competition intensity, pricing pressures, membership volatility, and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plans. The company faces risks from changes in customer behavior, demand volatility, and industry trends such as the introduction of new costly treatments and prescription drugs. The concentration of revenues in government programs (Medicare, Medicaid, military services) exposes Humana to risks from changes in government policies, premium payments, member eligibility, and program designs. The company also faces risks from changes in prescription drug pricing benchmarks and potential shifts in industry pricing methodologies. Market risks are further influenced by the volatility in securities and credit markets, including interest rate fluctuations that affect investment portfolio values and income. Humana mitigates interest rate risk through interest-rate swap agreements and maintains diversified investment portfolios with high credit quality. The company monitors competitive dynamics and regulatory developments to adapt its product offerings and pricing strategies. | Humana Inc. operates in a highly competitive health benefits industry with competitors varying by local market, some having larger membership bases and greater financial resources.

The company is exposed to risks from changes in medical cost trends, including increased utilization and costs of medical services and prescription drugs, and external factors like public health emergencies and natural disasters. Barriers to entry in markets are low, increasing the risk of new competitors entering. The company’s ability to maintain or improve Medicare star ratings affects premium bonuses and profitability. Changes in prescription drug pricing benchmarks may adversely affect financial performance. Market risks are mitigated through clinical initiatives, medical management programs, and strategic growth in Medicare and state-based contracts. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include challenges in business operations such as maintaining effective provider relationships, managing healthcare costs, and implementing clinical initiatives to improve member health outcomes and cost efficiency. Risks arise from the complexity of integrating acquisitions and divestitures, with potential adverse effects if integration fails or if strategic objectives are not met. The company depends heavily on information systems and data integrity; failures in maintaining, protecting, or enhancing these systems, including those incorporating AI/ML technologies, could disrupt operations, impair pricing accuracy, and damage reputation. Humana relies on third-party service providers for critical IT infrastructure, creating vulnerability to their performance. Cybersecurity threats and data breaches pose significant operational risks, with potential regulatory fines, liability, and reputational harm. The company employs a comprehensive cybersecurity program with governance oversight, training, monitoring, and third-party audits to mitigate these risks. Additionally, the pharmacy business faces operational risks from regulatory compliance, supply chain disruptions, and distribution challenges, including those related to public health emergencies and climate change. Human capital risks include competition for talent and the critical need for succession planning for key executives. The company also faces risks related to actuarial estimates and reserve adequacy for incurred but not reported benefits payable, which require significant judgment and are sensitive to medical cost trends and claim patterns. | Operational risks include challenges in business operations such as maintaining satisfactory relationships with providers, including physicians and hospitals, who may refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or become financially unstable, impacting service delivery and costs.

| Financial Risks | Financial risks encompass exposure to market risk from interest rate changes affecting investment income and interest expense, credit risk related to investment securities, liquidity risk, and risks associated with the company's capital structure. Humana holds a significant investment portfolio primarily in fixed maturity securities of investment-grade quality, subject to unrealized losses due to rising market interest rates. The company evaluates investment impairments quarterly using subjective judgment and diverse market and economic data. Liquidity risk is managed through cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and credit facilities, with substantial borrowing capacity under revolving credit agreements and a commercial paper program. Downgrades in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs and limit access to capital. The company uses interest-rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure on senior notes. Financial risks also include potential realized losses from sales or credit impairments of investments and the impact of regulatory restrictions on dividends from subsidiaries. Humana maintains compliance with financial covenants and monitors capital adequacy to support operations and growth. The company also faces risks from changes in Medicare risk-adjustment payments and potential liabilities from legal proceedings and regulatory investigations that could have financial impacts. | Financial risks include exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates affecting investment income and interest expense. The company holds a significant investment portfolio primarily of fixed maturity securities with investment-grade ratings; increases in interest rates have caused unrealized losses, with a continuing risk of further declines and realized losses. The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge fixed-rate senior notes, aligning interest costs with floating rates. Liquidity risk is managed through cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, credit agreements, and commercial paper programs, with adequate resources expected for at least twelve months. However, adverse credit market conditions or downgrades in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs and limit access to capital. The company’s debt includes senior notes and revolving credit agreements with covenants and interest rate adjustments tied to credit ratings. Credit risk exists in reinsurance recoverables and investment securities, with ongoing evaluation of impairment and credit losses. The company faces risks related to premium adequacy, benefit cost estimation, and reserves, which involve actuarial assumptions sensitive to medical cost trends and claim patterns. Changes in prescription drug pricing benchmarks and regulatory payment models (e.g., Medicare risk adjustment) also impact financial performance. The company maintains statutory capital and surplus exceeding regulatory minimums, with dividend payments subject to regulatory restrictions. Financial risks are mitigated through diversification of investments, hedging strategies, maintaining credit ratings, and actuarial review processes. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks arise from extensive federal, state, and local regulations governing Humana's health insurance and pharmacy businesses. The company is subject to laws such as the Health Care Reform Law, Families First Act, CARES Act, Inflation Reduction Act, HIPAA, HITECH Act, and various state regulations affecting product offerings, provider networks, marketing, and data privacy. Compliance challenges include adherence to anti-kickback statutes, physician self-referral laws (Stark Law), fraud and abuse laws, and risk adjustment data validation requirements. Humana faces risks from changes in regulatory interpretations, enforcement actions, and legislative developments that may restrict profitability, product design, or operational practices. The company is involved in litigation challenging regulatory rules, such as the Final RADV Rule, and actively monitors and responds to audits and investigations by CMS, HHS-OIG, state insurance departments, and other authorities. Non-compliance could result in fines, penalties, exclusion from government programs, reputational damage, and operational restrictions. Humana maintains proactive compliance programs, internal reviews, and legal defenses to mitigate these risks. The company also manages risks related to data privacy and cybersecurity under HIPAA and related laws, with established governance and reporting protocols. Regulatory capital and dividend restrictions imposed by state insurance regulators further impact compliance risk management. | Compliance risks arise from extensive federal, state, and local regulations affecting health insurance, pharmacy operations, and healthcare services.

Regulatory changes may restrict the company’s ability to manage provider networks, sell products, or operate profitably, and may impose additional costs or limit growth. The company faces risks from audits and investigations by CMS, HHS-OIG, state insurance departments, attorneys general, and other agencies, including Risk-Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits, which may result in penalties, fines, or exclusion from government programs. The recent CMS Final RADV Rule eliminating the Fee-for-Service Adjuster poses a material risk, and the company has filed suit challenging this rule. Compliance with privacy and data security laws requires significant resources; violations may lead to substantial penalties. The company must comply with state insurance regulations, including capital adequacy, licensing, product approvals, and dividend restrictions. Legal proceedings and qui tam lawsuits related to government contracts and fraud and abuse laws present ongoing compliance risks. The company mitigates compliance risks through proactive management, monitoring regulatory developments, internal audits, and legal actions to defend its positions. |
