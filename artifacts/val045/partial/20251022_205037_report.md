# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Humana Inc.'s revenue showed a consistent upward trend from 2022 to 2024, increasing from $92,870 million in 2022 to $106,374 million in 2023, and further to $117,761 million in 2024. Despite this growth, the gross margin declined from 18.50% in 2022 to 16.90% in 2023 and further to 14.52% in 2024, indicating rising cost pressures relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service in 2024 was predominantly from insurance premiums at $112,104 million, with insurance services revenue at $966 million and CenterWell services revenue at $3,465 million. In 2022, detailed insurance premiums revenue showed a strong Medicare focus with total Medicare premiums at $75,157 million and total premiums revenue at $87,712 million, complemented by $850 million in services revenue and $3,926 million from CenterWell segment services, highlighting a diversified revenue base within insurance and healthcare services. Geographic revenue data was not available for analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 4.09% in 2022 to 3.77% in 2023 and further to 2.18% in 2024, reflecting decreasing operating profitability despite revenue growth. Operating income decreased from $3,800 million in 2022 to $4,013 million in 2023 but then dropped significantly to $2,562 million in 2024, while revenue increased, indicating rising operating expenses or cost inefficiencies. Operating expenses were relatively stable between 2023 and 2024 at approximately $14,000 million but were reported unusually high at $89,070 million in 2022, likely a data anomaly or classification difference. The decline in operating margin and income relative to revenue suggests challenges in cost management and operational efficiency during this period. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 21.36% in 2022 to 24.71% in 2023 and slightly decreased to 24.00% in 2024, which contributed to a reduction in net profit margins from 3.02% in 2022 to 2.34% in 2023 and further to 1.03% in 2024. Income tax expense rose from $762 million in 2022 to $836 million in 2023 before falling to $413 million in 2024, consistent with the changes in pre-tax income and tax rates. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided financial data, limiting the ability to assess one-off impacts on profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Humana Inc. maintained a relatively stable financial position with total assets slightly decreasing from $47,065 million in 2023 to $46,479 million. Total liabilities also decreased from $30,747 million to $30,034 million, contributing to a modest increase in shareholders' equity from $16,262 million to $16,375 million. The current ratio improved from 158.89% to 176.01%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity and a stronger ability to cover current liabilities with current assets. The debt to equity ratio decreased slightly from 189.07% to 183.41%, suggesting a marginal reduction in leverage and a slightly more conservative capital structure. Overall, Humana's financial health in 2024 reflects stable asset management, improved liquidity, and a controlled capital structure despite minor declines in total assets. | In 2023, Humana Inc. demonstrated growth in total assets, increasing from $43,055 million in 2022 to $47,065 million, reflecting a 9.4% increase. Current assets rose by 14.5% to $29,986 million, supporting improved liquidity as indicated by the current ratio increasing from 152.42% to 158.89%. Non-current assets showed a modest increase to $17,079 million. Total liabilities increased by 11.1% to $30,747 million, with current liabilities rising to $18,872 million and non-current liabilities to $11,875 million. Shareholders' equity grew by 6.3% to $16,262 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings to $27,540 million. The debt to equity ratio increased slightly from 180.82% to 189.07%, indicating a marginally higher leverage but still a balanced capital structure. Overall, Humana's financial health in 2023 reflects asset growth and maintained liquidity, with a moderate increase in leverage and equity base expansion. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Humana's revenue increased significantly by approximately 10.7%, from $106,374 million in 2023 to $117,761 million in 2024, driven primarily by growth in insurance premiums and CenterWell services revenue. However, profitability metrics deteriorated notably. Gross profit declined from $17,980 million to $17,097 million, causing the gross margin to fall from 16.90% to 14.52%. Operating income dropped sharply from $4,013 million to $2,562 million, with operating margin decreasing from 3.77% to 2.18%. Net profit was halved from $2,484 million to $1,214 million, and net profit margin contracted from 2.34% to 1.03%. Return on equity and return on assets also declined substantially, from 15.73% to 7.44% and 5.51% to 2.60%, respectively. These trends indicate a significant erosion in earnings quality and profitability despite revenue growth, likely due to rising costs and expenses. | Revenue increased significantly by 14.6% from $92,870 million in 2022 to $106,374 million in 2023. Gross profit improved slightly to $17,980 million, but the gross margin declined from 18.50% to 16.90%, indicating increased cost pressures as cost of goods sold rose by 16.8% to $88,394 million. Operating income increased marginally to $4,013 million, but operating margin decreased from 4.09% to 3.77%, reflecting higher operating expenses relative to revenue. Net profit decreased by 11.3% to $2,484 million, with net profit margin declining from 3.02% to 2.34%. Income before taxes and net profit both declined, while income tax expense increased, pushing the effective tax rate up from 21.36% to 24.71%. Interest expense rose by 23% to $493 million, contributing to lower earnings. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 15.73% and 5.51%, respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and assets despite margin compression. Overall, while revenue growth was strong, profitability margins and net earnings quality weakened in 2023 due to rising costs and expenses. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency weakened in 2024. Cost of goods sold increased from $88,394 million to $100,664 million, outpacing revenue growth and compressing gross profit. Operating expenses rose slightly from $13,967 million to $14,135 million, contributing to a sharp decline in operating income. Asset turnover improved from 236.07% to 251.78%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations decreased from $3,981 million to $2,966 million, reflecting reduced cash generation efficiency. Working capital improved as current liabilities decreased more than current assets, supporting liquidity. Cash flow from investing remained negative but improved slightly, while cash flow from financing turned more negative, indicating increased outflows possibly related to debt repayments or other financing activities. Overall, while asset utilization improved, cost control and cash flow generation weakened in 2024. | Humana's cost control showed mixed results in 2023. Cost of goods sold increased faster than revenue, leading to a lower gross margin. Operating expenses decreased dramatically from $89,070 million in 2022 to $13,967 million in 2023, which appears to be an anomaly or reclassification, but operating income only increased slightly, suggesting operational efficiency gains may be offset by other factors. Asset turnover was very high at 236.07%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations declined by 13.2% to $3,981 million, signaling some pressure on cash generation despite revenue growth. Working capital improved slightly as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supporting liquidity. Net cash used in investing activities increased significantly to $(3,492) million, indicating higher investment outflows. Net cash from financing activities improved to $(856) million from $(1,914) million, reflecting reduced financing outflows. Overall, operational efficiency shows strong asset utilization but some challenges in cash flow generation and cost management. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators suggest some emerging concerns in 2024. Interest expense increased from $493 million to $660 million, while interest coverage ratio declined sharply from 814.00% to 388.18%, indicating reduced ability to cover interest obligations comfortably. Although the effective tax rate slightly decreased from 24.71% to 24.00%, income before taxes halved, reducing taxable income and overall profitability. The slight decrease in debt to equity ratio to 183.41% shows modest deleveraging, but the increase in non-current liabilities from $11,875 million to $13,095 million signals rising long-term obligations. The decline in net profit margin and cash from operations also heightens financial risk. Liquidity remains strong with an improved current ratio, but the combination of higher interest expense and lower profitability warrants close monitoring for potential financial stress. | Leverage increased slightly as debt to equity rose from 180.82% to 189.07%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased by 23% to $493 million, while interest coverage ratio declined from 947.63% to 814.00%, though still very strong, suggesting ample ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased from 21.36% to 24.71%, which could pressure net income. Liquidity remains solid with an improved current ratio of 158.89%. The decline in net cash from operations and increased investing outflows may pose liquidity risks if sustained. No inventories data is available, limiting assessment of inventory risk. Overall, financial risk indicators show moderate increase in leverage and tax burden, but strong interest coverage and liquidity mitigate immediate financial distress concerns. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, Humana's investment activity remains significant but slightly reduced, with net cash used in investing at $(2,952) million compared to $(3,492) million in 2023, indicating continued capital expenditures or acquisitions. The company maintained dividend payments at $431 million, reflecting a stable dividend policy despite lower earnings. The increase in revenue from insurance premiums and CenterWell services suggests growth opportunities in these segments. However, declining profitability and cash flow from operations may constrain future financial flexibility. The negative net cash flow from financing at $(2,487) million, more than double the prior year, could indicate debt repayments or share repurchases, which may impact liquidity. Overall, while revenue growth and segment expansion provide positive cues, sustaining cash flow and improving profitability will be critical for future financial performance. | Investment activity intensified in 2023 with net cash used in investing increasing to $(3,492) million from $(1,006) million, indicating potential expansion or capital expenditure that may support future growth. Net cash from operations declined but remains positive at $3,981 million, suggesting cash flow sustainability in the near term. Dividends increased slightly to $(431) million, reflecting a stable or modestly growing dividend policy. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the insurance segment premiums increasing to $101,272 million and insurance services revenue at $1,000 million, while CenterWell services revenue decreased to $3,033 million from $3,926 million in 2022, signaling potential shifts in segment performance. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional growth insights. Overall, Humana's future financial performance appears supported by strong investment activity and stable cash flows, though segment revenue shifts and margin pressures warrant monitoring. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Humana Inc. operates in a highly competitive health benefits industry with competitors varying by local market, some having larger membership bases and greater financial resources. The company faces risks from pricing products competitively, estimating benefits expenses accurately, and managing health care costs amid factors such as increased medical service utilization, new costly treatments, membership mix changes, and government-mandated benefits.
