# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue declined from $8,674,417K in 2022 to $7,750,652K in 2023 (-10.67%), and further slightly decreased to $7,711,541K in 2024 (-0.50%). Despite the revenue decline, gross profit showed a mixed trend: it decreased from $3,677,733K in 2022 to $3,303,601K in 2023 (-10.17%) but then increased to $3,582,299K in 2024 (+8.44%). Correspondingly, gross margin improved significantly from 42.40% in 2022 to 42.62% in 2023 and further to 46.45% in 2024, indicating better cost control or pricing power. By product, Pottery Barn revenue declined steadily from $3,555,521K in 2022 to $3,206,167K in 2023 (-9.86%) and $3,039,939K in 2024 (-5.17%). West Elm saw a sharper decline from $2,278,131K in 2022 to $1,854,811K in 2023 (-18.58%) and $1,840,582K in 2024 (-0.77%). Williams Sonoma revenue was relatively stable, slightly decreasing from $1,286,651K in 2022 to $1,260,045K in 2023 (-2.05%) but increasing to $1,302,821K in 2024 (+3.36%). Pottery Barn Kids and Teen showed a small decline from $1,132,937K in 2022 to $1,060,470K in 2023 (-6.39%) but rebounded to $1,107,057K in 2024 (+4.34%). The 'Other' category remained stable around $421K. Geographically, U.S. revenue decreased from $8,266,517K in 2022 to $7,670,352K in 2023 (-7.22%) and $7,375,241K in 2024 (-3.82%), while International revenue declined more sharply from $407,900K in 2022 to $328,300K in 2023 (-19.53%) but slightly increased to $336,300K in 2024 (+2.44%). This indicates a contraction in both domestic and international markets, with international revenue being a smaller portion and more volatile. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income decreased from $1,498,422K in 2022 to $1,244,193K in 2023 (-16.99%) but then increased to $1,430,184K in 2024 (+14.92%). Operating margin followed a similar pattern, declining from 17.27% in 2022 to 16.05% in 2023, then improving to 18.55% in 2024, surpassing the 2022 level. Operating expenses slightly decreased from $2,179,311K in 2022 to $2,059,408K in 2023 (-5.52%) but increased marginally to $2,152,115K in 2024 (+4.44%). The relationship between operating income and revenue improved in 2024 due to better gross margin and controlled operating expenses, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency. The company managed costs effectively in 2023 by reducing operating expenses despite revenue decline, and in 2024, it leveraged improved gross margins to boost operating income and margin, indicating stronger cost management and operational leverage. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed minor fluctuations: 24.84% in 2022, increasing to 25.41% in 2023, then decreasing to 24.26% in 2024. This slight reduction in 2024 contributed positively to net profit margin improvement from 12.25% in 2023 to 14.59% in 2024. Income tax expense decreased from $372,778K in 2022 to $323,593K in 2023 (-13.17%) and then increased to $360,481K in 2024 (+11.39%), consistent with operating income trends. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the provided information. External factors impacting profitability appear to include market contraction in both U.S. and international regions, with international revenue showing more volatility and sharper declines, possibly reflecting macroeconomic or geopolitical challenges affecting international sales. |
