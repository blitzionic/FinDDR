## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Xperi Inc. shows a slight decrease in total assets to $667,760K from $673,635K in 2023, indicating relatively stable asset base. Current assets decreased to $304,872K from $316,917K, while non-current assets slightly increased to $362,888K from $356,718K. Total liabilities declined significantly to $238,683K from $286,500K, driven by a sharp reduction in non-current liabilities to $53,334K from $121,388K, despite an increase in current liabilities to $185,349K from $165,112K. Shareholders' equity improved to $429,077K from $387,135K, reflecting stronger net asset position. The current ratio decreased to 164.49% from 191.94%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity but still above 1.5x, suggesting adequate liquidity. Debt to equity ratio improved to 55.63% from 74.01%, showing a healthier capital structure with less reliance on debt financing. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2024 improved with lower leverage and stronger equity, though liquidity slightly weakened compared to 2023. | In 2023, Xperi Inc. experienced a decrease in total assets to $673,635K from $736,911K in 2022, driven by declines in both current assets ($316,917K vs. $332,264K) and non-current assets ($356,718K vs. $404,647K). Total liabilities remained relatively stable at $286,500K compared to $287,925K in 2022, with a slight increase in current liabilities ($165,112K vs. $150,241K) offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities ($121,388K vs. $137,684K). Shareholders' equity declined notably to $387,135K from $448,986K, reflecting accumulated losses as retained earnings worsened to ($805,448K) from ($668,835K). The current ratio decreased to 191.94% from 221.15%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity but still a strong liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio increased to 74.01% from 64.13%, signaling a modestly higher leverage and a shift towards greater reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Overall, the company maintains a solid capital structure with manageable liabilities but faces pressure on equity and asset base contraction. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined by 5.3% to $493,688K in 2024 from $521,334K in 2023. Gross profit decreased to $379,932K from $402,706K, with gross margin slightly down to 76.96% from 77.25%, indicating stable cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. Operating expenses reduced significantly to $467,007K from $532,343K, improving operating loss to $(87,075)K from $(129,637)K, and operating margin improved from (24.87%) to (17.64%). Net profit loss narrowed dramatically to $(14,008)K from $(136,613)K, with net profit margin improving from (26.20%) to (2.84%). Income before taxes turned positive to $11,579K from a loss of $(129,646)K, but income tax expense increased to $12,448K from $10,042K, resulting in an effective tax rate of 107.50% compared to a negative rate in 2023. Return on equity improved substantially to (3.43%) from (32.68%), and return on assets improved to (2.09%) from (19.37%). These trends indicate improved earnings quality and profitability, though the company remains unprofitable on a net basis. | Xperi Inc. showed revenue growth in 2023, increasing to $521,334K from $502,260K in 2022, a positive trend. Gross profit improved to $402,706K from $379,314K, lifting the gross margin to 77.25% from 75.52%, indicating enhanced cost efficiency in production or pricing power. Operating expenses were significantly reduced to $532,343K from a very high $1,122,706K in 2022, which improved operating income loss to ($129,637K) from ($749,432K), narrowing the operating margin loss to (24.87%) from (149.21%). Net profit loss also improved substantially to ($136,613K) from ($757,484K), with net margin loss narrowing to (26.20%) from (150.82%). Despite these improvements, the company remains unprofitable. Return on equity and assets were negative at (32.68%) and (19.37%) respectively, reflecting ongoing challenges in generating returns from invested capital. The effective tax rate increased in magnitude to (7.75%) from (1.82%), consistent with losses. Overall, profitability and earnings quality improved markedly but remain negative. |
| Operational efficiency | Cost control improved as cost of goods sold decreased to $113,756K from $118,628K, and operating expenses were reduced by over $65 million. Asset turnover remained stable at 73.61% compared to 73.92% in 2023, indicating consistent utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations turned negative to $(55,340)K from a marginal positive $62K, signaling operational cash flow challenges. Inventories dropped sharply to $1,061K from $7,279K, suggesting tighter inventory management or lower stock levels. Working capital dynamics show current liabilities increased while current assets decreased, contributing to a lower current ratio. Net cash from investing activities improved to a positive $50,820K from a negative $(12,933)K, possibly reflecting asset sales or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities turned negative to $(19,350)K from a positive $7,052K, indicating debt repayments or reduced financing inflows. Overall, operational efficiency improved in cost control and asset utilization but operational cash flow deteriorated significantly. | Operational efficiency showed mixed signals in 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased to $118,628K from $122,946K despite higher revenue, contributing to improved gross margin. Operating expenses were sharply reduced, indicating strong cost control efforts. Asset turnover was high at 73.92%, suggesting effective utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations turned positive at $62K compared to a negative $28,445K in 2022, indicating a stabilization in operational cash flow. Inventories increased slightly to $7,279K from $6,662K, which may reflect inventory buildup or strategic stock positioning. Working capital dynamics show a slight decrease in current assets and increase in current liabilities, which may pressure short-term operational liquidity. Cash flow from investing remained negative but improved to ($12,933K) from ($64,846K), indicating reduced investment outflows. Financing cash flow dropped significantly to $7,052K from $135,751K, reflecting less reliance on external financing. Overall, operational efficiency improved with better cost control and asset utilization, and cash flow from operations stabilized. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage risk decreased as debt to equity ratio improved to 55.63% from 74.01%, and non-current liabilities were reduced substantially. Liquidity risk increased slightly with the current ratio declining to 164.49% from 191.94%, though still indicating reasonable short-term liquidity. Interest expense remained stable at approximately $3,008K, with interest coverage ratio decreasing to 2894.78% from 4321.23%, still indicating strong ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate rose sharply to 107.50% from (7.75%), which may indicate tax-related risks or adjustments impacting net profitability. Negative operating cash flow and increased current liabilities could pose liquidity stress if sustained. No dividends were paid in either year, reducing immediate cash outflow risk. Overall, financial risk has moderated with lower leverage but some caution warranted on liquidity and tax expense volatility. | Financial risk indicators show some areas of concern but also improvement. The debt to equity ratio increased to 74.01% from 64.13%, indicating higher leverage and potential increased financial risk. The current ratio decreased to 191.94% from 221.15%, though it remains strong, suggesting adequate liquidity to cover short-term obligations. Interest expense doubled to $3,000K from $1,512K, but interest coverage remains very high at 4,321.23% (down from 49,565.61%), indicating the company can comfortably meet interest payments despite increased expense. The effective tax rate moved further negative to (7.75%) from (1.82%), reflecting ongoing losses and potential tax asset utilization. The large negative retained earnings and continued net losses highlight ongoing profitability risk. The significant reduction in operating losses reduces risk but the company remains loss-making. Overall, leverage and interest expense increases warrant monitoring, but liquidity and interest coverage remain strong, mitigating immediate financial distress risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activity appears to have shifted positively with net cash from investing turning positive at $50,820K in 2024 from a negative $(12,933)K in 2023, suggesting asset disposals or reduced capital spending that may support cash flow. However, negative net cash from operations of $(55,340)K raises concerns about cash flow sustainability. The absence of dividends in 2024 indicates a conservative dividend policy, likely preserving cash for operational or strategic needs. Revenue by product shows growth in Pay-TV ($259,712K vs. $244,708K) and Connected Car ($111,144K vs. $94,864K), while Consumer Electronics and Media Platform revenues declined, signaling potential strategic focus areas. Geographically, revenue decreased in the U.S. and China but increased in Europe and Middle East, Latin America, and South Korea, suggesting shifting market dynamics. The company’s improved profitability and reduced leverage position it for potential recovery, but operational cash flow challenges and tax expense volatility may impact near-term financial performance. | Looking ahead, Xperi Inc.'s reduced investing cash outflows ($12,933K vs. $64,846K) suggest a more cautious or selective investment approach in 2023, which may preserve cash. The minimal net cash from operations ($62K) and negative net increase in cash ($5,693K decrease) indicate tight cash flow sustainability, with no dividends declared, implying retention of cash for operational needs or debt servicing. Revenue growth in key segments such as Connected Car ($94,864K vs. $84,201K) and Media Platform ($49,407K vs. $40,207K) and geographic expansion in Japan ($83,138K vs. $65,551K) and China ($35,809K vs. $30,932K) provide positive cues for future revenue diversification and growth potential. However, ongoing net losses and negative equity trends suggest the company must continue improving profitability and cash flow. The strong asset turnover and improved cost control bode well for operational leverage. Overall, the company appears to be stabilizing financially with growth in strategic segments but must maintain focus on cash flow improvement and profitability to ensure sustainable future performance. |
