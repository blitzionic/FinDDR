# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Xperi Inc.'s revenue showed a slight decline from $502,260 thousand in 2022 to $493,688 thousand in 2024, with a peak at $521,334 thousand in 2023. Gross margin improved steadily from 75.52% in 2022 to 76.96% in 2024, indicating better cost control relative to revenue. By product, Pay-TV remained the largest revenue contributor but decreased from $249,457 thousand in 2022 to $259,712 thousand in 2024 after a dip in 2023. Consumer Electronics revenue declined notably from $132,355 thousand in 2023 to $81,993 thousand in 2024, while Connected Car revenue increased from $84,201 thousand in 2022 to $111,144 thousand in 2024, showing growth in this segment. Media Platform revenue remained relatively stable around $40,000 thousand. Geographically, U.S. revenue decreased from $278,920 thousand in 2022 to $237,829 thousand in 2024, while Japan and Latin America showed growth, with Japan increasing from $65,551 thousand in 2022 to $80,773 thousand in 2024 and Latin America from $27,212 thousand to $38,772 thousand, indicating shifting regional dynamics. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from a deeply negative (149.21%) in 2022 to (17.64%) in 2024, reflecting a significant reduction in operating losses relative to revenue. Operating income losses narrowed from $(749,432) thousand in 2022 to $(87,075) thousand in 2024, while operating expenses decreased substantially from $1,121,746 thousand in 2022 to $467,985 thousand in 2024, demonstrating effective cost management. Despite the negative operating income, the reduction in operating expenses and improved operating margin suggest enhanced operational efficiency and tighter expense control over the period. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed a dramatic increase from a negative (1.82%) in 2022 to a high 107.50% in 2024, indicating a significant tax expense relative to pre-tax income in 2024 compared to prior years. Income tax expense rose from $13,589 thousand in 2022 to $12,448 thousand in 2024, despite lower profitability, which may have further pressured net profit.
