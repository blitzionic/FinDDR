## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, Xperi Inc. shows a slight decrease in total assets to $667,760K from $673,635K in 2023, indicating relatively stable asset base. Current assets decreased to $304,872K from $316,917K, while non-current assets slightly increased to $362,888K from $356,718K. Total liabilities declined significantly to $238,683K from $286,500K, driven by a sharp reduction in non-current liabilities to $53,334K from $121,388K, despite an increase in current liabilities to $185,349K from $165,112K. Shareholders' equity improved to $429,077K from $404,232K, reflecting stronger net asset position. The current ratio decreased to 164.49% from 191.94%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity but still a comfortable margin above 1. Debt to equity ratio improved to 55.63% from 70.88%, suggesting a healthier capital structure with less reliance on debt financing. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2024 shows improved equity strength and reduced leverage, though liquidity has slightly contracted. | In 2023, Xperi Inc. experienced a decline in total assets to $673,635K from $736,911K in 2022, driven by decreases in both current assets ($316,917K vs. $332,264K) and non-current assets ($356,718K vs. $404,647K). Total liabilities remained relatively stable at $286,500K compared to $287,925K in 2022, with a slight increase in current liabilities ($165,112K vs. $150,241K) offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities ($121,388K vs. $137,684K). Shareholders' equity decreased to $404,232K from $448,986K, reflecting the net losses and retained earnings deficit which worsened to ($805,448K) from ($668,835K). The current ratio declined from 221.15% to 191.94%, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity but still a comfortable margin above 1. The debt to equity ratio increased to 70.88% from 64.13%, suggesting a modest increase in leverage. Overall, the company maintains a solid equity base and manageable liabilities, but asset contraction and equity erosion highlight some financial strain. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue declined to $493,688K in 2024 from $521,334K in 2023, a decrease of approximately 5.3%. Gross profit decreased to $379,932K from $402,706K, with gross margin slightly down to 76.96% from 77.25%, indicating stable cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating expenses decreased significantly to $467,005K from $532,343K, improving operating loss to -$87,075K from -$129,637K, and operating margin improved from -24.87% to -17.64%. Net profit dramatically improved to a near break-even loss of -$869K from a substantial loss of -$139,688K, with net profit margin improving from -26.79% to -0.18%. Income before taxes turned positive at $11,579K compared to a loss of -$129,646K in 2023, though income tax expense increased to $12,448K from $10,042K, resulting in an effective tax rate of 107.50% versus a negative rate previously. Return on equity and assets both improved substantially, though still negative at -0.21% and -0.13% respectively, reflecting near breakeven profitability. Overall, earnings quality improved markedly with reduced losses and better margins, signaling operational improvements despite lower revenue. | Xperi Inc. showed revenue growth in 2023, increasing to $521,334K from $502,260K in 2022. Gross profit improved to $402,706K from $379,314K, lifting the gross margin to 77.25% from 75.52%, indicating improved cost of goods sold efficiency. Operating expenses were significantly reduced to $532,343K from $1,121,746K, which improved operating income loss to ($129,637K) from a much larger loss of ($749,432K) in 2022. Net loss also narrowed substantially to ($139,688K) from ($761,206K). Despite these improvements, profitability remains negative with net profit margin at (26.79%) and operating margin at (24.87%). Return on equity and assets are negative at (32.74%) and (19.81%) respectively, reflecting ongoing losses and asset base contraction. The effective tax rate increased in negativity to (7.75%) from (1.82%), consistent with losses. Overall, earnings quality improved markedly with reduced losses and better margins, but profitability remains below breakeven. |
| Operational efficiency | Xperi Inc. demonstrated improved operational efficiency in 2024. Cost of goods sold decreased to $113,756K from $118,628K, supporting a stable gross margin. Operating expenses were reduced by approximately 12%, aiding in narrowing operating losses. Asset turnover remained stable at 73.61%, nearly unchanged from 73.92% in 2023, indicating consistent utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories dropped sharply to $1,061K from $7,279K, suggesting better inventory management or lower stock levels. Net cash from operations surged to $55,340K from a negligible $62K in 2023, reflecting improved cash generation from core business activities. Working capital dynamics show current liabilities increased while current assets decreased, causing a decline in current ratio but cash flow improvements suggest effective working capital management. Net cash from investing activities increased to $50,820K from $12,933K, indicating higher investment activity. Net cash from financing also increased to $19,350K from $7,052K, supporting financing needs. Overall, operational efficiency improved with better cost control, stable asset utilization, and significantly enhanced cash flow from operations. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023 as evidenced by a higher asset turnover ratio of 73.92%, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Cost of goods sold decreased to $118,628K from $122,946K despite higher revenue, supporting improved gross margin. Operating expenses were cut by more than half, from $1,121,746K to $532,343K, demonstrating strong cost control efforts. However, net cash from operations was nearly flat at $62K compared to $28,445K in 2022, signaling challenges in converting improved earnings into cash flow. Working capital dynamics show current assets decreased while current liabilities increased, which may pressure liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities declined sharply to $12,933K from $64,846K, and financing cash flow also dropped to $7,052K from $135,751K, indicating reduced investment and financing activity. Overall, operational efficiency improved in cost control and asset use, but cash flow generation remains weak. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for 2024 show reduced leverage and improved liquidity risk profile. Debt to equity ratio decreased to 55.63% from 70.88%, lowering financial leverage and associated risk. Current ratio declined to 164.49% from 191.94%, indicating a slight reduction in short-term liquidity buffer but still well above 1, suggesting low immediate liquidity risk. Interest expense remained stable at approximately $3,008K, with interest coverage ratio decreasing to 2894.78% from 4321.23%, still indicating very strong ability to cover interest payments from operating income. The effective tax rate rose sharply to 107.50% from -7.75%, which may indicate tax expense anomalies or adjustments that could affect net profitability. The significant reduction in non-current liabilities reduces long-term financial risk. No dividend payments were reported in 2024, which may reflect cautious cash management. Overall, financial risk appears reduced with lower leverage and strong interest coverage, though the high effective tax rate warrants monitoring. | Financial risk indicators show mixed signals in 2023. The debt to equity ratio increased to 70.88% from 64.13%, indicating slightly higher leverage and potential risk. The current ratio decreased to 191.94% from 221.15%, though still strong, suggesting some reduction in liquidity buffer. Interest expense doubled to $3,000K from $1,512K, but interest coverage remains very high at 4,321.23%, down from an extremely high 49,565.61%, indicating the company can comfortably cover interest payments despite increased expense. The effective tax rate moved further negative to (7.75%), reflecting ongoing losses and tax benefits. The large negative retained earnings and net losses highlight ongoing operational risk. The sharp reduction in net cash from operations to $62K raises concerns about cash flow sustainability. Overall, while leverage and liquidity remain manageable, the company faces risks from continued losses, cash flow constraints, and increased interest costs. |
| Future financial performance projection | Xperi Inc.'s future financial performance appears cautiously optimistic based on 2024 data. The company increased net cash from investing activities to $50,820K, indicating active investment which may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities also rose to $19,350K, suggesting access to capital or debt repayment strategies. The substantial improvement in net cash from operations to $55,340K demonstrates enhanced cash flow sustainability, which is critical for funding operations and investments without external financing. No dividends were declared or paid in 2024, implying a focus on reinvestment or debt reduction rather than shareholder returns at this stage. Segment revenue trends show growth in Pay-TV (up to $259,712K) and Connected Car ($111,144K), while Consumer Electronics and Media Platform revenues declined, signaling potential strategic shifts or market dynamics to watch. Geographic revenue shows mixed trends with declines in U.S. and China but growth in Europe, Middle East, Latin America, and South Korea, suggesting diversification opportunities. Overall, the company is positioned for improved financial performance with active investment, strong cash flow, and evolving revenue streams, though continued monitoring of segment and regional performance will be important. | Looking ahead, Xperi Inc.'s revenue growth in key segments such as Connected Car ($94,864K, up from $84,201K) and Media Platform ($49,407K, up from $40,207K) suggests potential growth drivers. Geographic revenue increases in Japan, Latin America, China, and Other regions indicate expanding market presence. However, the sharp decline in net cash from operations to $62K and reduced investing ($12,933K) and financing activities ($7,052K) may constrain future investment capacity. The absence of dividends in 2023 and 2022 suggests a conservative dividend policy focused on preserving cash. The improved operating expense control and gross margin enhancement provide a foundation for potential profitability recovery. Sustained focus on cash flow improvement and managing leverage will be critical for financial stability. Overall, the company shows signs of operational recovery and market growth opportunities but must address cash flow and profitability challenges to ensure sustainable future performance. |
