| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 1.47% in 2022 to 0.19% in 2023, and then to 5.33% in 2024, reflecting a more stable tax environment but still low overall.

Current assets were $49,805, and current liabilities were $65,650, resulting in a current ratio of 75.86%, indicating potential liquidity concerns. The total liabilities increased to $327,102, leading to a debt-to-equity ratio of 752.67%, reflecting a very high leverage situation and a weakened equity position of $43,459. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | In 2024, the company reported revenue of $120,266, a decrease from $132,645 in 2023. Despite this, gross profit increased to $94,627, resulting in a gross margin of 78.68%, which is an improvement from 69.66% in 2023. However, operating income remained negative at -$31,941, with an operating margin of 26.56%. The net profit of $9,517 indicates a recovery from the previous year's loss, with a net profit margin of 7.91%.

The operating income was significantly negative at -$97,739, resulting in an operating margin of 73.68%. The net profit was a loss of -$115,461, with a net profit margin of 87.05%, indicating severe profitability issues. The return on equity was exceptionally high at 122.73%, but this was due to the low equity base rather than strong earnings. |
| Operational efficiency | In 2024, the operating margin decreased to 26.56%, reflecting ongoing challenges in cost management despite a reduction in operating expenses to $152,207 from $230,384 in 2023.

However, net cash from operations remained negative at -$5,298, highlighting ongoing operational inefficiencies and challenges in generating cash flow. | In 2023, the operating margin was significantly higher at 73.68%, but this was due to inflated operating expenses of $230,384.

| Financial risk identification and early warning | In 2024, the company faced high financial risk with a debt-to-equity ratio of 233.43%, indicating significant leverage. The current ratio of 111.58% suggests improved liquidity, but the interest coverage ratio of 135.41% indicates that the company can cover its interest expenses comfortably. The effective tax rate increased to 5.33%, which could impact future profitability if not managed properly. | In 2023, the company had a very high debt-to-equity ratio of 752.67%, indicating extreme financial risk. The current ratio of 75.86% raised concerns about liquidity, while the interest coverage ratio of 326.45% suggested that the company was able to meet its interest obligations. The effective tax rate was low at 0.19%, which may have provided some temporary relief but also indicated potential tax liabilities in the future. |
| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company is likely to focus on improving cash flow sustainability, as evidenced by a net cash from investing of $89,168, indicating potential growth investments. The reduction in operating expenses suggests a strategic shift towards cost management. However, the high debt levels and negative cash flow from operations may hinder future growth unless addressed. Market expansion efforts, particularly in North America, will be crucial for revenue recovery. | In 2023, the company faced significant challenges with negative cash flow from operations and high debt levels. The net cash from investing was negative at -$20,317, indicating limited investment activities. Future projections would need to focus on improving operational efficiency and managing liabilities to stabilize financial performance. The company’s reliance on North American revenue suggests that market conditions in this region will be critical for future growth. |
