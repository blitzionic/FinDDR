| Future financial performance projection | Looking ahead, the company’s investment activities in 2024, with net cash from investing at $89,168, indicate a focus on growth and expansion. However, the negative cash flow from operations raises concerns about sustainability. The company may need to reassess its dividend policy, as no dividends were declared in 2024. Market expansion efforts, particularly in North America, will be crucial for future revenue growth. | In 2023, the company faced significant challenges, with negative cash flow from operations at -$35,494, which hindered its ability to invest in growth. The negative net cash from investing at -$20,317 suggests a lack of investment in future opportunities. The company’s focus on improving operational efficiency and exploring new markets will be essential for recovery and future profitability. |
