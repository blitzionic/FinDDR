# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue increased from $113,765K to $132,645K, a growth of approximately 16.6%. However, from 2023 to 2024, revenue declined by about 9.3% to $120,266K. Gross margin improved from 71.93% in 2022 to 69.66% in 2023, then significantly increased to 78.68% in 2024, indicating better cost control or higher-margin sales in 2024. Subscription revenue, the largest product segment, grew from $100,522K in 2022 to $119,082K in 2023 (+18.5%) but declined to $111,073K in 2024 (-6.7%). Advisory revenue showed a slight increase from 2022 to 2023 but decreased in 2024. Advertising revenue decreased steadily from $2,703K in 2022 to $1,683K in 2024. Books revenue fluctuated, peaking in 2023 at $1,166K before dropping to $233K in 2024. Other revenue declined from $4,890K in 2022 to $2,637K in 2024. Geographically, North America remains the dominant market, growing from $98,951K in 2022 to $107,108K in 2023 (+8.3%) but then declining to $95,503K in 2024 (-10.8%). Europe showed strong growth from $10,072K in 2022 to $21,792K in 2024 (+116.4%), indicating a significant expansion. Australia and Asia revenues remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations. Overall, the company experienced strong revenue growth in 2023 driven by subscription and European markets but faced a contraction in 2024 with a notable improvement in gross margin. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from a negative (77.52%) in 2022 to (73.68%) in 2023 and further to (26.56%) in 2024, showing a trend toward better operating efficiency despite remaining negative. Operating income losses narrowed significantly from $(88,189)K in 2022 to $(97,739)K in 2023, then improved substantially to $(31,941)K in 2024. Operating expenses decreased from $201,954K in 2022 to $230,384K in 2023 (+14.1%) but then sharply declined to $152,207K in 2024 (-34%). This reduction in operating expenses in 2024 contributed to the improved operating margin and reduced operating losses. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that while revenue decreased in 2024, the company managed to control operating expenses effectively, improving operational performance. Cost management appears to have been a key focus in 2024, leading to a more efficient cost structure and reduced losses at the operating level. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted from a positive 1.47% in 2022 to a negative (0.19%) in 2023, then increased to 5.33% in 2024. The negative tax rate in 2023 suggests tax benefits or credits possibly related to losses, while the positive rate in 2024 indicates a return to tax payments as profitability improved. Income tax expense was negative in 2022 (-$3,254K), minimal in 2023 ($223K), and increased to $536K in 2024, consistent with the tax rate trend. Net profit margin improved dramatically from a large negative (191.85%) in 2022 to (87.05%) in 2023 and then to a positive 7.91% in 2024, reflecting the combined effects of improved gross margin, operating efficiency, and tax position. No explicit non-recurring items are noted in the data, but the large swings in operating income and net profit margins suggest prior years were impacted by significant losses or unusual charges. External factors such as market contraction in North America and growth in Europe likely influenced profitability dynamics. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a mixed but improving financial position compared to 2023. Total assets decreased from $370,561K to $326,197K, driven by a reduction in non-current assets from $320,756K to $269,010K, while current assets increased from $49,805K to $57,187K, indicating a shift towards more liquid assets. Total liabilities significantly declined from $327,102K to $228,366K, with both current liabilities dropping from $65,650K to $51,253K and non-current liabilities from $261,452K to $177,113K, reflecting strong liability management and deleveraging. Shareholders' equity more than doubled from $43,459K to $97,831K, improving the capital structure and indicating enhanced net worth. The current ratio improved from 0.76 to 1.12, suggesting better short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased sharply from 752.67% to 233.43%, signaling a healthier balance between debt and equity financing. Overall, the company strengthened its balance sheet with reduced leverage, improved liquidity, and a stronger equity base in 2024. | In 2023, the company experienced a decline in total assets from $433,157K in 2022 to $370,561K, indicating a contraction in asset base. Current assets decreased significantly from $86,005K to $49,805K, while non-current assets also declined from $347,152K to $320,756K. Total liabilities increased from $288,467K to $327,102K, driven by rises in both current liabilities (from $62,112K to $65,650K) and non-current liabilities (from $226,355K to $261,452K). Shareholders' equity sharply decreased from $144,690K to $43,459K, reflecting a weakened equity position. Retained earnings further deteriorated from a negative $700,743K to negative $816,416K, signaling accumulated losses. Liquidity weakened as the current ratio dropped from 138.47% to 75.86%, indicating potential short-term liquidity stress. The debt to equity ratio surged from 199.37% to 752.67%, highlighting a significant increase in leverage and a more aggressive capital structure reliant on debt financing. Overall, the financial position in 2023 shows reduced asset base, increased liabilities, diminished equity, and weakened liquidity, pointing to a stressed balance sheet and financial health deterioration compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability improved markedly in 2024. Revenue declined by about 9.3% from $132,645K in 2023 to $120,266K, yet gross profit increased slightly from $92,394K to $94,627K due to a significant reduction in cost of goods sold from $40,251K to $25,639K. This drove gross margin up from 69.66% to 78.68%, indicating improved cost efficiency in production or service delivery. Operating expenses decreased substantially from $230,384K to $152,207K, reducing the operating loss from $(97,739)K to $(31,941)K and improving the operating margin from (73.68%) to (26.56%). Net profit swung from a large loss of $(115,461)K in 2023 to a positive $9,517K in 2024, with net profit margin improving from (87.05%) to 7.91%. Return on equity turned positive at 13.47% from a negative (122.73)%, and return on assets improved to 2.73% from (28.73)%, reflecting earnings sustainability and improved profitability quality. The effective tax rate increased to 5.33% from a negative rate, consistent with positive pre-tax income. Overall, 2024 shows a significant turnaround in earnings quality and profitability despite lower revenue. | Revenue improved notably in 2023, rising from $113,765K in 2022 to $132,645K, driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue ($119,082K vs. $100,522K) and Europe geographic revenue ($19,749K vs. $10,072K). However, profitability remained negative with net profit loss narrowing from ($218,257K) to ($115,461K). Gross profit was $92,394K in 2023, with a slight decline in gross margin from 71.93% to 69.66%, indicating marginally higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating expenses increased from $201,954K to $230,384K, worsening operating income loss from ($88,189K) to ($97,739K). Net profit margin improved from (191.85%) to (87.05%), reflecting reduced losses relative to revenue but still negative. Return on equity was negative at (122.73%) and return on assets at (28.73%), indicating poor earnings quality and lack of profitability sustainability. The effective tax rate turned slightly negative (-0.19%) in 2023 from a positive 1.47% in 2022, reflecting a tax benefit or credit. Overall, while revenue growth was strong, profitability remains deeply negative with losses narrowing but still substantial, and returns on capital remain poor. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024. The operating margin, while still negative at (26.56)%, improved substantially from (73.68)% in 2023, reflecting better cost control and expense management. Asset turnover increased slightly from 33.01% to 34.52%, indicating marginally better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations improved significantly, reducing the negative cash flow from $(35,494)K in 2023 to $(5,298)K in 2024, showing progress towards operational cash flow sustainability. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities decreased, contributing to a higher current ratio of 1.12. These factors collectively suggest enhanced operational efficiency and better management of costs and assets in 2024. | Operating margin improved slightly from (77.52%) in 2022 to (73.68%) in 2023, indicating some improvement in cost control relative to revenue despite operating losses. Asset turnover was high at 33.01%, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate revenue, although this figure may be influenced by the reduced asset base. Net cash from operations improved, with cash outflow reducing from ($72,625K) to ($35,494K), indicating better operational cash flow management but still negative. Working capital position weakened as current assets declined and current liabilities increased, reflected in the current ratio drop to 75.86%. Overall, operational efficiency shows some improvement in margin and cash flow management, but the company continues to operate at a loss with negative operating cash flow and strained working capital. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show improvement but some caution remains. Leverage decreased notably, with debt to equity falling from 752.67% to 233.43%, reducing financial risk. Liquidity improved as the current ratio rose from 0.76 to 1.12, indicating better ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense decreased from $29,940K to $23,589K, easing interest burden. However, interest coverage remains negative at (135.41)%, though improved from (326.45)%, indicating operating income is still insufficient to cover interest expenses fully, posing ongoing risk. The effective tax rate increased to 5.33% from a negative rate, reflecting taxable profitability but also a new tax expense. Overall, while leverage and liquidity risks have diminished, the company still faces challenges in interest coverage and must monitor cash flow to mitigate financial risk. | Financial risk increased in 2023 as leverage intensified, with debt to equity ratio rising sharply to 752.67% from 199.37%, indicating a heavy reliance on debt financing and increased solvency risk. Liquidity risk is elevated given the current ratio fell below 1 to 75.86%, suggesting potential difficulties in meeting short-term obligations. Interest expense decreased significantly from $95,741K to $29,940K, improving interest coverage ratio from (92.11%) to (326.45%), which indicates better ability to cover interest costs despite ongoing losses. The effective tax rate turned negative, which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets but also adds complexity to earnings quality. Overall, the company faces heightened financial risk due to increased leverage and weakened liquidity, though interest coverage improved due to lower interest expense. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a positive net cash inflow from investing of $89,168K compared to an outflow of $(20,317)K in 2023, suggesting asset sales or divestitures that may impact future growth capacity. Net cash from financing was negative at $(71,432)K versus a positive $12,077K in 2023, indicating debt repayments or reduced financing activities, consistent with deleveraging. The net increase in cash was positive at $12,154K, improving liquidity. Revenue by product shows a decline in subscription revenue from $119,082K to $111,073K and other revenue streams, with advisory and books revenue also decreasing, except advertising which slightly increased. Geographically, North America revenue declined from $107,108K to $95,503K, while Europe revenue increased from $19,749K to $21,792K, and Australia and Asia showed mixed trends. These shifts suggest potential geographic rebalancing and challenges in core subscription revenue growth. No dividend data is available, so dividend policy cannot be assessed. Overall, the company appears to be focusing on strengthening liquidity and reducing debt, with cautious revenue growth prospects and possible strategic shifts in geographic markets. | Investment activities show increased cash outflow from investing activities, doubling from ($10,242K) in 2022 to ($20,317K) in 2023, indicating ongoing investment or capital expenditure. Financing cash inflows decreased sharply from $111,530K to $12,077K, suggesting reduced external financing or debt raising. Net cash decreased by $43,923K in 2023, reversing the prior year's increase, which may pressure liquidity. Revenue growth in subscription and European markets suggests potential growth areas, while advertising revenue declined. No dividend payments were reported, consistent with ongoing losses and cash constraints. Overall, future performance may depend on sustaining revenue growth in key segments and managing cash flow, with investment continuing but financing sources reduced, indicating cautious growth outlook amid financial stress. |
