# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. experienced a revenue increase from $113,765K in 2022 to $132,645K in 2023, followed by a decline to $120,266K in 2024. Despite the revenue dip in 2024, gross profit improved from $81,828K in 2022 to $92,394K in 2023 and further to $94,627K in 2024, reflecting a rising gross margin from 71.93% in 2022 to 78.68% in 2024. Subscription revenue, the largest product segment, grew steadily from $100,522K in 2022 to $111,073K in 2024, while advisory and advertising revenues showed slight fluctuations. Geographically, North America remained the dominant market, increasing from $98,951K in 2022 to $95,503K in 2024 with a peak in 2023 at $107,108K. Europe revenue nearly doubled from $10,072K in 2022 to $21,792K in 2024, indicating strong regional growth. Asia revenue decreased from $4,595K in 2023 to $1,695K in 2024, suggesting a contraction in that market. Overall, the company improved cost efficiency in goods sold, reducing COGS from $40,251K in 2023 to $25,639K in 2024, supporting the gross margin expansion despite lower revenue in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed significant improvement from a negative (77.52%) in 2022 and (73.68%) in 2023 to a less negative (26.56%) in 2024, indicating better control over operating losses. Operating income, while still negative, improved from a loss of $97,739K in 2023 to a loss of $31,941K in 2024 against revenues of $132,645K and $120,266K respectively. Operating expenses decreased substantially from $190,133K in 2023 to $126,568K in 2024, reflecting effective cost management efforts. This reduction in operating expenses was a key driver in narrowing operating losses despite the revenue decline. The company’s ability to reduce operating expenses by approximately 33% year-over-year while maintaining a strong gross margin suggests a strategic focus on operational efficiency and cost containment. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from a negative (0.19%) in 2023 to a positive 5.33% in 2024, contributing to a positive net profit of $9,517K in 2024 compared to significant net losses in prior years ($115,461K loss in 2023 and $218,257K loss in 2022). Income tax expense shifted from a credit of $(3254)K in 2022 to an expense of $536K in 2024, indicating a normalization of tax obligations. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided data. The improvement in net profit margin to 7.91% in 2024 from large negative margins in previous years suggests that tax and possibly other external factors contributed positively to the bottom line in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. shows a notable improvement in its financial health compared to 2023. Total assets decreased from $370,561K to $326,197K, driven by a reduction in non-current assets from $320,756K to $269,010K, while current assets increased from $49,805K to $57,187K, indicating a shift towards more liquid assets. Total liabilities significantly declined from $327,102K to $228,366K, with both current liabilities dropping from $65,650K to $51,253K and non-current liabilities from $261,452K to $177,113K. Shareholders' equity more than doubled from $43,459K to $97,831K, reflecting improved net worth and financial stability. The current ratio improved from 0.76 to 1.12, indicating enhanced liquidity and better short-term financial health. The debt to equity ratio decreased sharply from 752.67% to 233.43%, showing a substantial reduction in leverage and a stronger capital structure. Overall, the company’s balance sheet in 2024 reflects a healthier liquidity position, reduced financial risk, and a more balanced capital structure compared to 2023. | In 2023, FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. experienced a decline in total assets to $370,561K from $433,157K in 2022, driven by decreases in both current assets (from $86,005K to $49,805K) and non-current assets (from $347,152K to $320,756K). Total liabilities increased significantly to $327,102K from $288,467K, with both current liabilities rising slightly (from $62,112K to $65,650K) and non-current liabilities increasing notably (from $226,355K to $261,452K). Shareholders' equity sharply contracted to $43,459K from $144,690K, reflecting a weakened capital base. The current ratio deteriorated from 138.47% to 75.86%, indicating reduced short-term liquidity and potential challenges in meeting current obligations. The debt to equity ratio surged from 199.37% to 752.67%, highlighting a substantial increase in leverage and a more aggressive capital structure reliant on debt financing. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 shows increased financial risk due to higher leverage and lower liquidity, alongside a shrinking equity cushion. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | FiscalNote Holdings experienced a mixed profitability profile in 2024. Revenue declined by approximately 9.3% from $132,645K in 2023 to $120,266K in 2024. Despite lower revenue, gross profit increased slightly from $92,394K to $94,627K, driven by a significant reduction in cost of goods sold from $40,251K to $25,639K, resulting in an improved gross margin rising from 69.66% to 78.68%. Operating expenses decreased substantially from $190,133K to $126,568K, which reduced the operating loss from $(97,739)K to $(31,941)K and improved the operating margin from (73.68%) to (26.56%). Most notably, net profit swung from a large loss of $(115,461)K in 2023 to a positive net income of $9,517K in 2024, lifting the net profit margin from (87.05%) to 7.91%. Return on equity improved dramatically from (122.73%) to 13.47%, and return on assets turned positive from (28.73%) to 2.73%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and profitability. The effective tax rate increased from a negative (0.19%) to a positive 5.33%, consistent with the shift to profitability. Overall, 2024 marks a significant turnaround in profitability and earnings quality for the company. | FiscalNote Holdings improved its revenue in 2023 to $132,645K, up 16.6% from $113,765K in 2022, driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue ($119,082K vs. $100,522K) and European geographic sales ($19,749K vs. $10,072K). However, profitability remained negative with a net loss of $115,461K, though this was a significant improvement from the $218,257K loss in 2022. Gross profit increased to $92,394K from $81,828K, but the gross margin declined slightly to 69.66% from 71.93%, indicating some margin pressure possibly due to higher cost of goods sold ($40,251K vs. $31,937K). Operating expenses rose to $190,133K from $170,017K, worsening the operating loss to $(97,739)K from $(88,189)K, though the operating margin improved slightly from (77.52%) to (73.68%). The net profit margin improved substantially from (191.85%) to (87.05%), reflecting better earnings quality despite ongoing losses. Return on equity and assets were negative at (122.73%) and (28.73%) respectively, consistent with continued unprofitability but showing some improvement in loss magnitude. The effective tax rate turned slightly negative (-0.19%) compared to a positive 1.47% in 2022, reflecting a tax benefit or credit in 2023. Interest expense decreased markedly to $29,940K from $95,741K, improving interest coverage from (92.11%) to (326.45%), which suggests better earnings relative to interest costs despite losses. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by better cost control and asset utilization. Cost of goods sold decreased by 36.3%, from $40,251K to $25,639K, outpacing the revenue decline, which contributed to a higher gross margin. Operating expenses were also reduced by 33.4%, from $190,133K to $126,568K, indicating effective expense management. Asset turnover slightly increased from 33.01% to 34.52%, showing marginally better utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations remained negative at $(5,298)K, though this is a significant improvement from the $(35,494)K outflow in 2023, suggesting progress towards operational cash flow sustainability. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities decreased, supporting better short-term operational liquidity. Cash flow from investing activities turned positive to $89,168K from a negative $(20,317)K, indicating possible asset sales or divestitures. Net cash from financing activities was negative $(71,432)K compared to a positive $12,077K in 2023, reflecting possible debt repayments or reduced financing inflows. Overall, operational efficiency improved with better cost control and asset use, but operational cash flow remains a challenge. | Operationally, FiscalNote Holdings showed mixed efficiency signals in 2023. Revenue growth of 16.6% was accompanied by a higher cost of goods sold, reducing gross margin slightly. Operating expenses increased by 11.8%, outpacing revenue growth, which contributed to continued operating losses. The asset turnover ratio was reported at 33.01, indicating high revenue generation relative to asset base, though this figure appears unusually high and may reflect accounting or classification specifics. Net cash from operations improved, with a smaller negative outflow of $(35,494)K compared to $(72,625)K in 2022, indicating better cash management or operational cash generation despite losses. Working capital weakened as current assets declined and current liabilities increased, consistent with the drop in current ratio. Net cash used in investing activities doubled to $(20,317)K from $(10,242)K, suggesting increased investment outflows. Financing cash inflows dropped sharply to $12,077K from $111,530K, indicating reduced external financing. The net decrease in cash was $(43,923)K in 2023 versus a net increase of $28,214K in 2022, reflecting cash burn and liquidity pressure. No dividends were paid in either year, consistent with the loss position. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show a marked reduction in leverage and improved liquidity in 2024. The debt to equity ratio fell sharply from 752.67% to 233.43%, indicating a significant deleveraging and lower financial risk. The current ratio improved from 0.76 to 1.12, suggesting better short-term liquidity and ability to meet current obligations. Interest expense decreased from $29,940K to $23,589K, reducing the burden of debt servicing. However, the interest coverage ratio remains negative at (135.41%), improving from (326.45%) in 2023 but still indicating that operating income is insufficient to cover interest expenses, which is a risk factor. The effective tax rate increased to 5.33% from a negative rate, consistent with profitability but also implying a higher tax burden. The company’s net cash from operations remains negative, albeit improved, which could pressure liquidity if sustained. No dividends were paid, indicating a conservative cash distribution policy. Overall, while leverage and liquidity risks have decreased, the company still faces challenges in interest coverage and operational cash flow generation that warrant monitoring. | The financial risk profile of FiscalNote Holdings in 2023 shows elevated concerns. The debt to equity ratio ballooned to 752.67% from 199.37%, signaling a highly leveraged balance sheet and increased solvency risk. The current ratio fell below 1.0 to 75.86%, indicating potential liquidity constraints and difficulty covering short-term liabilities with current assets. Despite a large net loss, interest expense decreased substantially, improving interest coverage ratio to (326.45%) from (92.11%), which may reflect lower debt costs or restructuring but remains negative, indicating earnings are insufficient to cover interest. The effective tax rate turned negative (-0.19%), which may reflect tax credits or deferred tax assets but also adds complexity to earnings quality. Retained earnings deepened their negative balance to $(816,416)K from $(700,743)K, underscoring accumulated losses and weakened equity. The combination of high leverage, poor liquidity, and ongoing losses presents significant financial risk and early warning signs for solvency and operational sustainability. |
| Future financial performance projection | The positive net cash from investing activities of $89,168K in 2024 suggests significant asset sales or divestitures, which may not be sustainable long-term but provide immediate liquidity. The negative net cash from financing activities of $(71,432)K indicates debt repayments or reduced financing inflows, consistent with deleveraging efforts. The improvement in net profit and positive net cash flow trends from operations, though still negative, suggest a trajectory towards cash flow sustainability. No dividends were declared or paid, implying that the company is prioritizing reinvestment or debt reduction over shareholder distributions. Revenue by product shows a decline in subscription revenue from $119,082K to $111,073K, the largest segment, which may impact future top-line growth. Geographically, revenue in North America decreased, while Europe showed growth, indicating potential regional shifts in market focus or performance. The company’s improved profitability and reduced leverage position it better for future investments, but sustaining growth will require addressing subscription revenue declines and operational cash flow deficits. Overall, the company appears to be stabilizing financially with cautious investment and financing strategies, but future performance will depend on maintaining revenue streams and improving cash generation. | Looking forward, FiscalNote Holdings’ future financial performance appears challenged but with some positive indicators. The company increased investment outflows in 2023, with net cash used in investing activities rising to $(20,317)K, suggesting ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Subscription revenue and European geographic sales showed strong growth, indicating potential areas for revenue expansion. However, the sharp decline in net cash from financing activities to $12,077K from $111,530K in 2022 suggests reduced external funding availability, which may constrain liquidity and investment capacity. The negative operating and net cash flows, combined with a declining cash balance, raise concerns about cash flow sustainability absent improved profitability or financing. No dividends were declared, consistent with the need to conserve cash. The company’s high leverage and weak equity base imply that future performance will depend heavily on operational improvements, cost control, and successful revenue growth in key segments. Without these, financial risks may intensify, but the investment in growth areas and improved interest coverage provide some cautious optimism. |

Compliance obligations encompass privacy and consumer information laws, anti-corruption and anti-bribery statutes such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act, export controls, customs, economic sanctions, and government contracting regulations. Non-compliance may result in severe civil and criminal penalties, reputational harm, and operational restrictions including suspension or debarment from government contracts. The company incurs significant costs to maintain compliance and must monitor evolving laws and regulations, which may be ambiguous or conflicting. Lobbying activities may require registration and adherence to strict reporting and conduct rules. Operating as a public company imposes additional compliance burdens under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Act, SEC regulations, and NYSE listing standards, increasing legal, accounting, and governance costs. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could lead to inaccurate financial disclosures and loss of investor confidence. The company must also comply with complex international laws related to data security, taxation, trade, and intellectual property. Cybersecurity incidents may trigger regulatory investigations and fines.

| Monitoring mechanisms | Monitoring mechanisms include oversight by management, including the CEO and CFO, who participate in evaluations of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. The company conducted testing throughout the year to validate the effectiveness of remediation measures for prior material weaknesses. The Insider Trading Compliance Officer, designated as the General Counsel or delegate, administers and monitors compliance with insider trading policies, including review and approval of transactions, monitoring employee training, and ensuring adherence to federal and state insider trading laws.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is involved in oversight, including receiving disclosures of significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. Management performs ongoing monitoring and additional analysis to ensure financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP despite identified weaknesses. The company also has a Compensation Committee responsible for administering the Executive Compensation Clawback Policy. External audits are conducted by independent registered public accounting firms, which assess internal controls as part of their audit procedures, although no attestation report on internal control over financial reporting was included due to the company's emerging growth company status. The company monitors cybersecurity risks and data protection measures continuously and invests in improving internal access controls and security measures. Remediation efforts for material weaknesses are tracked and reported, with management acknowledging the limitations and ongoing nature of these efforts. |
| Identified material weaknesses or deficiencies | In the prior year, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to: (a) ineffective information technology general controls concerning administrative user access and user access provisioning and monitoring; (b) ineffective controls over fair market value changes to financial instruments; and (c) ineffective controls over accounting for stock compensation. During fiscal year 2024, the company implemented a comprehensive remediation plan including removal of inappropriate administrative access and enhancements to controls over user access management, fair market value changes, and stock-based compensation accounting. Management determined that these previously identified material weaknesses were fully remediated as of December 31, 2024. No new material weaknesses or deficiencies were identified during 2024. | Management identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023: (a) Ineffective information technology general controls related to administrative user access to information systems relevant to financial statement preparation, including inadequate segregation of duties and insufficient restrictions on access to financial applications and data; (b) Ineffective user access provisioning and monitoring controls; (c) Ineffective controls over accounting for fair market value changes to financial instruments; and (d) Ineffective controls over stock compensation accounting. These deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Despite these weaknesses, no uncorrected material misstatements to the consolidated financial statements were identified, and no changes to previously released financial results were necessary. The company is actively engaged in remediation efforts but cannot guarantee that these will fully resolve the deficiencies or prevent future material weaknesses. |
| Effectiveness | Management, including the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of that date. The audit committee was informed of all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses, which were remediated. The company qualifies as an emerging growth company and thus the independent registered public accounting firm did not provide an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting for 2024. Management acknowledges inherent limitations in internal controls and the possibility of future material weaknesses but believes the remediation efforts have strengthened the control environment and addressed prior issues. | Management, under the supervision and participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the identified material weaknesses in the control environment, specifically inadequate controls surrounding access provisioning and monitoring of financially relevant systems and applications, controls over fair market value changes to financial instruments, and stock compensation accounting. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have certified that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023 due to these material weaknesses. Management believes that the consolidated financial statements fairly present the financial position and results of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP, notwithstanding the control deficiencies. The company continues remediation efforts but acknowledges the inherent limitations of internal controls and the possibility of future material weaknesses. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | FiscalNote faces economic challenges including potential adverse effects from future high inflation rates, despite no material impact to date. The company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with the Euro, British Pound Sterling, and Australian Dollar, which may adversely affect results as international operations grow. The company’s financial performance is sensitive to changes in U.S. government spending priorities, delays or disruptions in government funding, and budget constraints, which could materially impact revenues given a significant portion of revenue derives from U.S. government agencies. Additionally, the company has a significant amount of debt with associated payment obligations that may limit available funds and restrict operational flexibility, increasing vulnerability to economic downturns. Market conditions such as increased accessibility to free or low-cost information sources may reduce demand for FiscalNote’s products, potentially forcing price reductions or additional capital investments that could lower profit margins.
