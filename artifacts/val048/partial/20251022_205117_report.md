# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. experienced a revenue increase from $113,765K in 2022 to $132,645K in 2023, followed by a decline to $120,266K in 2024. Gross margin improved from 71.93% in 2022 to 78.68% in 2024, indicating better cost control relative to revenue despite the revenue dip in 2024. Subscription revenue, the largest segment, grew from $100,522K in 2022 to $111,073K in 2024, while advisory revenue fluctuated, peaking at $13,563K in 2023 before dropping to $4,640K in 2024. Geographically, North America remained the dominant market, increasing from $98,951K in 2022 to $95,503K in 2024 with a peak in 2023 at $107,108K. Europe showed steady growth from $10,072K in 2022 to $21,792K in 2024, while Asia and Australia revenues were relatively stable but smaller contributors. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin showed significant improvement from a negative (77.52%) in 2022 to (26.56%) in 2024, reflecting a reduction in operating losses relative to revenue. Operating income losses narrowed from $(88,189)K in 2022 to $(31,941)K in 2024, while operating expenses decreased from $201,954K in 2022 to $152,207K in 2024, indicating effective cost management. Despite the revenue decline in 2024, the company managed to reduce operating expenses by approximately 24.7% from 2023 to 2024, contributing to improved operating efficiency. The operating income as a percentage of revenue improved but remained negative, signaling ongoing challenges in achieving profitability at the operating level. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 1.47% in 2022 to 5.33% in 2024, with a negative rate of (0.19%) in 2023, indicating variability in tax expense impact on profitability. Income tax expense shifted from a benefit of $(3,254)K in 2022 to a tax expense of $536K in 2024, which contributed positively to net profit in 2024. No explicit non-recurring items or external factors affecting profitability were listed in the provided data, suggesting that the observed profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance and cost management rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. shows a notable improvement in its financial health compared to 2023. Total assets decreased from $370,561K to $326,197K, driven by a reduction in non-current assets from $320,756K to $269,010K, while current assets increased from $49,805K to $57,187K, enhancing liquidity. Total liabilities declined significantly from $327,102K to $228,366K, with current liabilities dropping from $65,650K to $51,253K and non-current liabilities from $261,452K to $177,113K. Shareholders' equity more than doubled from $43,459K to $97,831K, reflecting a stronger capital base. The current ratio improved from 0.76 to 1.12, indicating better short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased sharply from 752.67% to 233.43%, signaling a less leveraged and more stable capital structure. Overall, the company’s balance sheet shows enhanced solvency and liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. experienced a decline in total assets to $370,561K from $433,157K in 2022, driven by decreases in both current assets (from $86,005K to $49,805K) and non-current assets (from $347,152K to $320,756K). Total liabilities increased significantly to $327,102K from $288,467K, with both current liabilities rising slightly (from $62,112K to $65,650K) and non-current liabilities increasing more substantially (from $226,355K to $261,452K). Shareholders' equity sharply contracted to $43,459K from $144,690K, reflecting a weakened capital base. The current ratio dropped from 138.47% to 75.86%, indicating reduced short-term liquidity and potential challenges in meeting current obligations. The debt to equity ratio surged from 199.37% to 752.67%, signaling a much higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure reliant on debt financing. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 shows increased leverage, diminished equity cushion, and weaker liquidity compared to 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | FiscalNote Holdings experienced a turnaround in profitability in 2024. Revenue declined by 9.3% from $132,645K in 2023 to $120,266K, yet gross profit increased slightly from $92,394K to $94,627K due to a significant reduction in cost of goods sold from $40,251K to $25,639K, improving gross margin from 69.66% to 78.68%. Operating loss narrowed substantially from $(97,739)K to $(31,941)K, improving operating margin from (73.68%) to (26.56%). Net profit swung from a loss of $(115,461)K in 2023 to a positive $9,517K in 2024, resulting in a net profit margin of 7.91% compared to a negative 87.05% previously. Return on equity improved dramatically from (122.73%) to 13.47%, and return on assets turned positive at 2.73% from a negative 28.73%. These metrics indicate improved earnings quality and operational leverage despite lower top-line revenue. | FiscalNote Holdings improved its revenue in 2023 to $132,645K, up from $113,765K in 2022, driven primarily by growth in subscription revenue ($119,082K vs. $100,522K) and advisory services ($13,563K vs. $4,914K). Despite revenue growth, gross profit increased modestly to $92,394K from $81,828K, but the gross margin declined slightly to 69.66% from 71.93%, indicating rising cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating expenses increased to $230,384K from $201,954K, worsening operating losses to $(97,739)K from $(88,189)K, though the operating margin improved slightly from (77.52%) to (73.68%). Net loss narrowed significantly to $(115,461)K from $(218,257)K, improving the net profit margin from (191.85%) to (87.05%). The effective tax rate turned slightly negative at (0.19%) compared to 1.47% previously, reflecting a tax benefit or adjustment. Return on equity and assets remain negative at (122.73%) and (28.73%) respectively, indicating continued unprofitability and poor earnings quality despite margin improvements. Interest expense dropped markedly to $29,940K from $95,741K, positively impacting net results and interest coverage ratio, which improved from (92.11%) to (326.45%). |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024 as evidenced by better cost control and asset utilization. Operating expenses decreased sharply from $230,384K to $152,207K, a 34% reduction, contributing to a narrower operating loss. Asset turnover slightly increased from 33.01% to 34.52%, indicating marginally better utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations dropped significantly from $35,494K in 2023 to $5,298K in 2024, suggesting weaker cash generation despite improved profitability. Working capital improved with current assets rising and current liabilities falling, supporting liquidity. Cash flow from investing surged from $20,317K to $89,168K, and financing cash flow increased from $12,077K to $71,432K, indicating active investment and financing activities. Overall, the company improved cost efficiency and asset use but faces challenges in operational cash flow generation. | Operationally, FiscalNote Holdings’ cost control appears challenged as operating expenses rose by approximately 14% year-over-year, outpacing revenue growth of about 16.6%. The asset turnover ratio is reported at 33.01, which is unusually high and may reflect a data anomaly or specific accounting treatment; however, it suggests high revenue generation relative to asset base. Net cash from operations declined significantly to $35,494K from $72,625K, indicating reduced cash generation efficiency despite higher revenue. Working capital weakened as current assets decreased and current liabilities increased, consistent with the drop in current ratio to 75.86%. Net cash from investing activities increased to $20,317K from $10,242K, showing higher investment outflows or asset purchases. Net cash from financing activities fell sharply to $12,077K from $111,530K, indicating reduced external financing inflows. The net increase in cash improved to $43,923K from $28,214K, reflecting better cash flow management or timing differences. No dividends were paid in either year, consistent with the company’s loss position. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show reduced leverage and improved liquidity but persistent interest coverage concerns. The debt to equity ratio fell markedly from 752.67% to 233.43%, lowering financial risk. The current ratio improved from 0.76 to 1.12, indicating better short-term liquidity. However, interest expense remains high at $23,589K, and interest coverage, while improved from (326.45%) to (135.41%), remains negative, signaling the company’s operating income is still insufficient to cover interest costs comfortably. The effective tax rate increased from a negative (0.19%) to a positive 5.33%, reflecting a return to taxable profitability. No dividends were paid in 2023 and data for 2024 is unavailable, suggesting cautious cash distribution policy. Overall, leverage and liquidity risks have decreased, but interest burden and cash flow coverage remain areas to monitor. | FiscalNote Holdings faces elevated financial risk in 2023 due to a substantial increase in leverage, with the debt to equity ratio rising to 752.67% from 199.37%, indicating a heavy reliance on debt relative to equity. The current ratio of 75.86% signals liquidity risk, as current liabilities exceed current assets, potentially impairing the company’s ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense decreased significantly, improving interest coverage ratio to (326.45%) from (92.11%), but the negative coverage still indicates operating losses insufficient to cover interest costs. The effective tax rate turned negative, which may reflect tax credits or adjustments but also adds complexity to earnings quality. Retained earnings deepened their negative balance to $(816,416)K from $(700,743)K, underscoring accumulated losses and financial strain. The combination of high leverage, weak liquidity, and ongoing losses presents early warning signs of financial distress. |
| Future financial performance projection | FiscalNote Holdings’ future financial performance appears cautiously optimistic. The company’s significant net cash inflow from investing activities ($89,168K) and financing activities ($71,432K) in 2024 suggests active investment and capital raising, potentially to support growth or restructuring. The positive net profit and improved equity base provide a foundation for sustainable operations. However, the sharp decline in net cash from operations to $5,298K raises concerns about cash flow sustainability. The revenue mix shows a decline in subscription revenue from $119,082K to $111,073K, but growth in other revenue streams such as advertising ($0 to $1,683K) and other revenue ($0 to $2,637K) may indicate diversification. Geographically, North America revenue declined, while Europe increased slightly, and Asia revenue decreased, suggesting potential regional shifts. No dividend data for 2024 implies retention of earnings for reinvestment. The company’s future performance will depend on sustaining operational cash flow improvements and managing interest costs amid ongoing investment. | Looking ahead, FiscalNote Holdings’ increased net cash from investing activities ($20,317K) suggests ongoing investment in growth or asset base, which could support future revenue expansion. However, the sharp reduction in net cash from financing activities ($12,077K) compared to 2022 indicates less reliance on external capital raising, possibly reflecting tighter credit conditions or strategic deleveraging. The absence of dividends aligns with the company’s current loss position and need to conserve cash. Revenue growth in subscription and advisory segments, along with geographic expansion in Europe and Asia, provides positive cues for diversified and potentially sustainable revenue streams. Nevertheless, the company must address its high leverage, liquidity constraints, and operating losses to ensure cash flow sustainability and improve financial stability for future performance. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | FiscalNote operates in highly competitive markets subject to rapid technological changes and evolving customer demands. Principal competitors include well-established companies with substantial resources and newer specialized firms. Competitors may adopt new technologies faster, offer more cost-effective or bundled solutions, or engage in aggressive pricing, potentially reducing demand for FiscalNote's products and services. Increased availability of free or low-cost information sources may also reduce demand. Market risks include volatility in customer spending, economic conditions, and the accuracy of market opportunity estimates. The company faces risks from potential entry of large, well-funded competitors and must continuously innovate and invest in technology and acquisitions to maintain competitiveness. Failure to meet customer price expectations or to successfully bundle products could adversely affect revenues. Additionally, reliance on U.S. government contracts exposes the company to risks from changes in government spending priorities and funding availability.

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Risk assessment procedures | FiscalNote has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, and control various types of risks including liquidity risk, strategic risk, operational risk, cybersecurity risk, and reputational risk. These procedures involve risk analyses and business/product knowledge to identify and manage potential risks associated with strategic initiatives. The company acknowledges that despite these efforts, risks may not be effectively managed and unforeseen risks may exist. The risk management framework's effectiveness is critical to avoid unexpected losses or adverse effects on the business. The evaluation of internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). | FiscalNote has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, and control various types of risks including liquidity risk, strategic risk, operational risk, cybersecurity risk, and reputational risk. These risk management processes are part of an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program that establishes an annual cadence for identifying material risks and includes quarterly reporting to the Audit Committee on risk severity and mitigation measures. The company uses the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as guidelines for evaluating internal control over financial reporting.

The company also performs periodic tabletop exercises involving external resources and relevant Board members to assess cybersecurity preparedness. However, the company acknowledges that its risk management processes and procedures may not be fully effective and that there may be unidentified or unmitigated risks. |
| Control activities | FiscalNote implemented specific control activities including policies and procedures to maintain records that accurately reflect transactions and dispositions of assets, ensure proper authorization of receipts and expenditures, and prevent or detect unauthorized acquisitions, use, or disposition of assets. The company has a comprehensive Insider Trading Policy that includes trading windows, blackout periods, approval procedures for trades by directors and officers, and restrictions on prohibited activities such as tipping, hedging, and margin trading. Controls over user access to information systems were enhanced, including removal of inappropriate administrative access and improvements in user access provisioning and monitoring. Controls over fair market value changes to financial instruments and accounting for stock-based compensation were also implemented and enhanced. The company complies with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and similar laws through policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance. Firewalls are used to restrict the flow of confidential information within the company to only those employees who need to know. The company also maintains policies for employee benefit plans and Rule 10b5-1 trading plans to regulate insider trading activities. | FiscalNote's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures designed to maintain records that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets, ensure transactions are properly recorded to allow preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use, or disposition of assets. The company maintains internal access control mechanisms and security measures to protect sensitive information and restrict access to financial applications and data. The company has adopted an Incident Response Plan for cybersecurity incidents, which includes reporting, escalation, investigation, remediation, and compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. The company also maintains a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and complies with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Additionally, FiscalNote has implemented an Executive Compensation Clawback Policy to recover erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement. The company is working on remediation plans to address identified material weaknesses, including improving access provisioning and monitoring controls, fair market value accounting controls, and stock compensation accounting controls. The company also obtains SOC-2 certification for many of its products, subjecting them to annual third-party compliance audits. |
| Monitoring mechanisms | Monitoring mechanisms include oversight by management, including the CEO and CFO, who participate in evaluations of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. The Insider Trading Compliance Officer and the Insider Trading Compliance Committee (comprising the Compliance Officer, CEO, and CFO) monitor compliance with insider trading policies, approve or prohibit proposed transactions, administer training programs, and ensure adherence to federal and state insider trading laws. The company conducts ongoing testing and validation of internal controls, including remediation measures. The Compliance Officer maintains records and reports related to insider trading and periodically reviews and updates policies. The company also monitors cybersecurity risks and implements security measures, although it acknowledges inherent limitations. The audit committee and independent registered public accounting firm provide additional oversight, although the company, as an emerging growth company, does not include an attestation report from the accounting firm on internal controls. | Monitoring of internal controls and risk management is conducted through several mechanisms. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program and cybersecurity risk. The ERM program includes quarterly reporting to the Audit Committee on the severity of identified risks and mitigation efforts. The Audit Committee receives annual updates from the information security function on cybersecurity risks and safeguards.

Additionally, the company undergoes annual SOC-2 compliance audits for many of its products, conducted by third parties. Management also discloses significant deficiencies and material weaknesses to the audit committee and independent auditors as part of its internal control evaluation process. |
| Identified material weaknesses or deficiencies | In the prior year, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective information technology general controls concerning administrative user access and user access provisioning and monitoring, ineffective controls over fair market value changes to financial instruments, and ineffective controls over accounting for stock compensation. During fiscal year 2024, the company implemented a comprehensive remediation plan addressing these weaknesses, including removal of inappropriate administrative access and enhancements to controls over user access management, fair market value changes, and stock-based compensation accounting. Management has determined that these previously identified material weaknesses have been fully remediated as of December 31, 2024. | Management identified material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, specifically: (a) ineffective information technology general controls related to administrative user access to financial systems, including inadequate segregation of duties and insufficient restriction of access to financial applications and data, as well as user access provisioning and monitoring; (b) ineffective controls over the accounting for fair market value changes to financial instruments; and (c) ineffective controls over stock compensation accounting. These deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Despite these weaknesses, no uncorrected material misstatements to the financial statements were identified, and no changes to previously released financial results were necessary. The company is actively engaged in remediation efforts but cannot guarantee the success of these initiatives or that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. |
| Effectiveness | Management, under the supervision and participation of the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on COSO's Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of that date. The CEO and CFO certified the effectiveness of these controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The company acknowledges inherent limitations in any internal control system and the possibility that effectiveness may vary over time. No changes in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting. | Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Due to the identified material weaknesses in the control environment, management concluded that the company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of that date. The Audit Committee and management recognize the inherent limitations of internal controls and the possibility that controls may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has performed additional analyses and procedures to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and believes the financial statements fairly present the company's financial position and results of operations. The company continues remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses but cannot assure that these efforts will fully remediate the deficiencies or prevent future weaknesses. |
