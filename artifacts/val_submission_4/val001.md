# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue showed a strong upward trend from 2022 to 2024, increasing from RM 17,988,687m in 2022 to RM 24,383m in 2024. However, the 2022 figure appears anomalously high compared to 2023 and 2024, suggesting a possible data inconsistency. Focusing on 2023 to 2024, revenue grew by approximately 16.5% (from RM 20,935m to RM 24,383m). Gross profit increased from RM 12,491,134m in 2022 to RM 17,564m in 2024, with gross margin slightly declining from 130.56% in 2022 to 127.97% in 2024, indicating a marginal decrease in cost efficiency relative to revenue. By product/service, healthcare services dominate revenue, growing from £16,360m in 2022 to £23,027m in 2024, a 40.7% increase, reflecting strong demand or expansion in this segment. Laboratories services revenue slightly declined from £1,065m in 2022 to £1,032m in 2024, while management fees increased modestly from £26m to £40m. Education services revenue, present in 2022 and 2023 (£267m and £58m respectively), was absent in 2024, indicating a possible divestment or discontinuation. Geographically, all regions showed revenue growth from 2022 to 2024. Türkiye and Europe saw the largest increase from £4,349m to £7,423m (+70.7%), followed by Singapore from £4,824m to £6,304m (+30.7%), India from £3,175m to £4,707m (+48.3%), Malaysia from £3,046m to £4,267m (+40.1%), and Greater China from £998m to £1,528m (+53.1%). The 'Others' category remained negligible. This indicates successful geographic expansion or market penetration, especially in Türkiye and Europe and Greater China. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined significantly from 55.62% in 2022 to 16.92% in 2024, indicating a substantial reduction in operating profitability relative to revenue. Operating income decreased from RM 10,004,874m in 2022 to RM 4,125m in 2024, despite revenue growth, suggesting rising operating expenses or lower operational leverage. Operating expenses increased from RM 2,486,260m in 2022 to RM 13,439m in 2024, a substantial rise that outpaced revenue growth, reflecting deteriorating cost management or increased investment in operations. The ratio of operating income to revenue dropped sharply, highlighting efficiency challenges. The data suggests the company is facing higher operational costs or inefficiencies that are eroding profitability despite growing top-line revenue. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate decreased from 25.80% in 2022 to 15.81% in 2024, reducing the tax burden and positively impacting net profitability. Income tax expense decreased from RM 571,949m in 2022 to RM 594m in 2024, consistent with the lower tax rate and possibly lower taxable income. Net profit margin improved from 9.15% in 2022 to 12.97% in 2024, despite the operating margin decline, likely due to tax benefits. No explicit non-recurring items or unusual patterns are indicated in the data. External factors such as geographic expansion into high-growth regions (Türkiye and Europe, Greater China) and product/service portfolio changes (discontinuation of education services) may have influenced profitability dynamics. The significant drop in operating margin alongside stable or improving net margin suggests external tax or financial structuring impacts mitigating operational challenges. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from RM 50,192 million in 2023 to RM 56,759 million, reflecting asset growth primarily driven by non-current assets rising from RM 43,479 million to RM 49,888 million. Total liabilities also increased significantly from RM 17,833 million to RM 22,851 million, with both current liabilities (RM 7,456 million to RM 9,576 million) and non-current liabilities (RM 10,377 million to RM 13,275 million) rising. Shareholders' equity improved moderately from RM 32,359 million to RM 33,908 million, supported by an increase in retained earnings from RM 7,840 million to RM 9,708 million. However, liquidity weakened as the current ratio declined from 90.03% to 71.75%, indicating a lower buffer of current assets against current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio increased from 55.11% to 67.39%, suggesting a higher leverage and greater reliance on debt financing. Overall, the balance sheet shows growth in assets and equity but with increased liabilities and reduced short-term liquidity, indicating a need for careful liability management going forward. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from RM 48,467 million in 2022 to RM 50,192 million, reflecting asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from RM 40,185 million to RM 43,479 million. Total liabilities decreased from RM 19,308 million to RM 17,833 million, indicating effective liability management, particularly a reduction in non-current liabilities from RM 12,049 million to RM 10,377 million, despite a slight increase in current liabilities from RM 6,601 million to RM 7,456 million. Shareholders' equity strengthened significantly, rising from RM 29,159 million to RM 32,359 million, supported by increased retained earnings from RM 6,665 million to RM 7,840 million. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 111.47% to 90.03%, suggesting a tighter short-term liquidity position but still above 1. Capital structure improved with a lower debt to equity ratio of 55.11% compared to 66.22% in 2022, indicating reduced leverage and a stronger equity base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue grew robustly by 16.5% from RM 20,935 million in 2023 to RM 24,383 million in 2024, driven by increases across key geographic regions and healthcare services. Gross profit increased from RM 14,603 million to RM 17,564 million, though the gross margin slightly declined from 130.25% to 127.97%, indicating a marginally higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income improved significantly from RM 3,071 million to RM 4,125 million, with operating margin rising from 14.67% to 16.92%, reflecting better control over operating expenses relative to revenue growth. However, net profit decreased from RM 3,391 million to RM 3,162 million, causing net profit margin to fall from 16.20% to 12.97%. This decline in net profitability despite higher operating income is influenced by increased interest expense (RM 941 million to RM 1,065 million) and a slight reduction in income before taxes. Return on equity and return on assets both declined, from 11.02% to 9.54% and 6.87% to 5.91% respectively, indicating reduced earnings quality and sustainability. The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from 16.25% to 15.81%. Overall, while top-line and operating profitability improved, net earnings quality weakened due to higher financing costs and lower net margins. | Revenue for 2023 was RM 20,935 million, showing a decrease compared to RM 17,988,687 million in 2022, but this appears to be a unit inconsistency; focusing on margins and ratios, gross profit was RM 14,603 million with a stable gross margin of 130.25%, slightly lower than 130.56% in 2022. Operating income dropped significantly to RM 3,071 million from RM 10,004,874 million in 2022, reflected in a sharp decline in operating margin from 55.62% to 14.67%. However, net profit improved to RM 3,391 million from RM 1,645,142 million, with net profit margin increasing from 9.15% to 16.20%, indicating improved bottom-line efficiency and earnings quality. Return on equity was 11.02% and return on assets 6.87%, both indicating reasonable profitability and earnings sustainability. The effective tax rate decreased from 25.80% to 16.25%, positively impacting net earnings. |
| Operational efficiency | The company improved operational efficiency in 2024 as evidenced by an increase in asset turnover from 42.44% to 45.60%, indicating more effective use of assets to generate revenue. Operating margin increased from 14.67% to 16.92%, reflecting better cost control relative to revenue growth despite an increase in operating expenses from RM 11,532 million to RM 13,439 million. Inventories rose modestly from RM 640 million to RM 681 million, consistent with revenue growth. Net cash from operations increased from RM 3,759,434 (likely a data anomaly or unit inconsistency) in 2023 to RM 4,285 million in 2024, showing improved cash generation from core business activities. Working capital management appears challenged as the current ratio declined, but the increase in current assets from RM 6,713 million to RM 6,871 million was outpaced by current liabilities growth from RM 7,456 million to RM 9,576 million. Overall, operational efficiency improved with better asset utilization and operating margins, supported by stronger cash flow from operations. | Operating expenses increased substantially to RM 11,532 million from RM 2,486,260 million in 2022, contributing to the reduced operating income and margin. Asset turnover was high at 42.44, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations increased slightly to RM 3,759,434 million from RM 3,667,643 million, showing strong cash generation capability. Inventories rose from RM 519 million to RM 640 million, which may require monitoring for inventory management. Working capital dynamics show current assets decreased from RM 7,358 million to RM 6,713 million while current liabilities increased, contributing to the lower current ratio. Overall, cost control appears challenged given the operating expense increase, but asset utilization and cash flow from operations remain robust. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show increased leverage and liquidity pressures. The debt to equity ratio rose from 55.11% to 67.39%, indicating higher financial leverage and potential risk from increased debt obligations. The current ratio declined from 90.03% to 71.75%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity and a tighter position to cover current liabilities. Interest expense increased from RM 941 million to RM 1,065 million, but interest coverage improved from 326.35% to 387.32%, suggesting that operating income growth sufficiently covers interest costs despite higher debt. The effective tax rate remained stable, minimizing tax-related risk changes. The increase in both current and non-current liabilities warrants monitoring for refinancing and repayment risks. Overall, while interest coverage is strong, the rising leverage and declining liquidity ratios highlight emerging financial risks that require proactive management. | Leverage decreased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio falling from 66.22% to 55.11%, reducing financial risk. However, liquidity risk increased slightly with the current ratio dropping to 90.03% from 111.47%, indicating tighter short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased from RM 657,413 million to RM 941 million, while interest coverage ratio declined sharply from 1521.86% to 326.35%, signaling reduced but still comfortable ability to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate reduction to 16.25% from 25.80% may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, which could affect future tax liabilities. Overall, financial risk is moderate with improved leverage but some caution warranted on liquidity and interest coverage trends. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a net cash outflow from investing of RM (8,247) million, slightly lower than RM (936,291) million in 2023, indicating continued but moderated capital expenditure or acquisitions. Net cash from financing turned positive at RM 3,033 million compared to a large outflow in 2023, suggesting new financing or debt issuance to support growth or liquidity. Dividends paid decreased significantly from RM (1,770,205) million to RM (881) million, indicating a more conservative dividend policy or cash retention for reinvestment. Revenue growth was strong across all major geographic regions, especially Türkiye and Europe (from RM 5,674 million to RM 7,423 million) and Healthcare services (from RM 19,582 million to RM 23,027 million), signaling promising market expansion. Cash flow sustainability appears stable with improved operational cash flow, but the net decrease in cash was negative at RM (929) million, indicating slight cash depletion. Overall, the company is positioned for growth with ongoing investments and geographic expansion, balanced by cautious dividend distribution and financing activities to support future performance. | Investment activities show a significant reduction in net cash used for investing from RM (1,853,894) million in 2022 to RM (936,291) million in 2023, suggesting a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow to RM (3,998,581) million from RM (2,919,853) million, driven by a substantial rise in dividends paid from RM (528,162) million to RM (1,770,205) million, indicating a strong dividend policy but potential pressure on cash reserves. Revenue by product shows growth in healthcare services from £16,360m to £19,582m and management fees from £26m to £40m, while laboratories and education services declined, signaling a strategic focus on core healthcare and management services. Geographically, revenue increased across all regions, notably in Singapore, India, and Türkiye and Europe, indicating broad-based geographic growth. Cash flow sustainability appears stable given strong operational cash flow, but high dividend payouts and reduced investing cash flow may constrain future growth unless operational performance improves. |
