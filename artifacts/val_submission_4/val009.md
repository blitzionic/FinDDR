# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue slightly decreased by 3.5% from MYR 5,308,285K to MYR 5,123,689K, then increased by 3.8% to MYR 5,318,342K in 2024, showing a recovery but overall flat growth across the three years. Gross profit declined sharply by 29% from MYR 1,048,304K in 2022 to MYR 744,431K in 2023, then rebounded by 26.4% to MYR 940,596K in 2024. Despite fluctuations, gross margin remained relatively stable around 180%, with a slight increase from 180.25% in 2022 to 185.47% in 2023, then a minor decrease to 182.31% in 2024, indicating consistent cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. Revenue from oil palm based products grew by 6.3% from MYR 1,394,895K in 2023 to MYR 1,482,259K in 2024, reflecting product line expansion or increased demand; 2022 data is unavailable for comparison. Geographically, revenue in Malaysia decreased by 4% from MYR 1,843,583K in 2023 to MYR 1,770,321K in 2024, Asia-Pacific revenue declined slightly by 1.2% from MYR 3,044,501K to MYR 3,006,888K, while revenue from other regions more than doubled from MYR 235,605K to MYR 541,133K, indicating a strategic shift or growth in emerging markets outside core regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 12.69% in 2022 to 7.89% in 2023, then improved to 10.99% in 2024, showing operational challenges in 2023 followed by partial recovery. Operating income followed a similar pattern, dropping 40% from MYR 673,699K in 2022 to MYR 404,048K in 2023, then rising 44.6% to MYR 584,481K in 2024. The operating income to revenue ratio reflects this volatility, with efficiency deteriorating in 2023 but improving in 2024. Operating expenses were reported as MYR (3,741,490K) in 2022, which appears to be a data anomaly or misclassification, but in 2023 and 2024, expenses were MYR 384,527K and MYR 373,752K respectively, showing a slight reduction of 2.8% in 2024, indicating modest cost management improvements. Overall, the company faced operational efficiency challenges in 2023 but managed to enhance cost control and profitability in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable over the three years, with a slight decrease from 24.60% in 2022 to 24.38% in 2024, and a peak of 25.28% in 2023, indicating consistent tax expense relative to pre-tax income without significant tax planning changes. Income tax expense decreased from MYR 164,539K in 2022 to MYR 106,349K in 2023, then increased to MYR 150,146K in 2024, mirroring the fluctuations in operating income and net profit. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the provided financials. External factors impacting profitability include geographic revenue shifts, notably the strong growth in 'Others' region revenue in 2024, which may reflect market expansion or diversification efforts mitigating risks from core markets. No other external or one-off impacts are evident from the data. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company maintained a stable total asset base at MYR 5,211,209 thousand, slightly lower than 2023's MYR 5,213,241 thousand, indicating asset stability. Current assets decreased marginally to MYR 2,538,570 thousand from MYR 2,553,534 thousand, while non-current assets increased slightly to MYR 2,672,639 thousand. Total liabilities declined significantly by approximately 20.5% to MYR 1,225,263 thousand from MYR 1,541,047 thousand, driven mainly by a sharp reduction in current liabilities from MYR 916,083 thousand to MYR 603,210 thousand. Non-current liabilities remained relatively stable. Shareholders' equity strengthened notably by 8.5% to MYR 3,985,946 thousand, supported by an increase in retained earnings to MYR 2,868,336 thousand. The current ratio improved substantially to 420.84% from 278.74%, reflecting enhanced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved to 30.74% from 41.97%, indicating a stronger equity position and reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet shows improved financial health with stronger equity, reduced liabilities, and enhanced liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid overall financial position with total assets increasing from MYR 4,893,976 thousand in 2022 to MYR 5,213,241 thousand, indicating asset growth of approximately 6.6%. Current assets grew notably by 17% to MYR 2,553,534 thousand, while non-current assets slightly decreased to MYR 2,659,707 thousand. Total liabilities increased moderately by 6.5% to MYR 1,541,047 thousand, driven primarily by a significant rise in current liabilities from MYR 597,156 thousand to MYR 916,083 thousand, whereas non-current liabilities decreased by about 26.5% to MYR 624,964 thousand. Shareholders' equity strengthened by 6.5% to MYR 3,672,194 thousand, supported by an increase in retained earnings to MYR 2,573,545 thousand. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 365.40% to 278.74%, reflecting higher current liabilities relative to current assets but still indicating a strong liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio remained stable at approximately 42%, suggesting consistent capital structure and manageable leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth in assets and equity with controlled liabilities, maintaining financial stability and capital adequacy in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 3.8% to MYR 5,318,342 thousand in 2024 from MYR 5,123,689 thousand in 2023. Cost of goods sold remained nearly flat, leading to a significant gross profit increase of 26.4% to MYR 940,596 thousand. Despite a slight decrease in gross margin percentage from 185.47% to 182.31%, operating expenses decreased by 2.8%, improving operating income by 44.6% to MYR 584,481 thousand. Operating margin rose from 7.89% to 10.99%, reflecting better cost control and profitability. Net profit increased by 48.1% to MYR 465,792 thousand, with net profit margin improving from 6.14% to 8.76%. Return on equity increased from 8.83% to 12.16%, and return on assets improved from 6.22% to 8.94%, indicating enhanced earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 24.38%, supporting higher net income. Overall, 2024 shows strong profitability growth and improved earnings sustainability. | The company experienced a decline in revenue from MYR 5,308,285 thousand in 2022 to MYR 5,123,689 thousand in 2023, a decrease of about 3.5%. Despite this, the gross margin improved slightly from 180.25% to 185.47%, indicating better cost management or product mix at the gross profit level. However, gross profit decreased significantly from MYR 1,048,304 thousand to MYR 744,431 thousand, reflecting the lower revenue and increased cost of goods sold (COGS increased from MYR 4,259,981 thousand to MYR 4,379,258 thousand). Operating expenses shifted from a negative MYR 3,741,490 thousand in 2022 to a positive MYR 384,527 thousand in 2023, which appears to be a data anomaly or reclassification but resulted in a lower operating income of MYR 404,048 thousand compared to MYR 673,699 thousand in 2022. Net profit declined by 37.6% to MYR 314,372 thousand, with net profit margin dropping from 9.50% to 6.14%. Return on equity was 8.83% and return on assets was 6.22%, indicating moderate profitability and earnings sustainability. The effective tax rate slightly increased to 25.28%. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with lower revenue and net income, though margins at the gross level improved, suggesting some resilience in core operations. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses decreased slightly to MYR 373,752 thousand from MYR 384,527 thousand, contributing to an improved operating margin of 10.99%. Asset turnover increased marginally to 102.04% from 101.39%, indicating stable asset utilization. Inventories increased by 17% to MYR 634,596 thousand, which may suggest higher stock levels or preparation for demand. Net cash from operations surged by 78.8% to MYR 658,406 thousand, reflecting strong cash generation from core business activities. Working capital improved significantly as current liabilities decreased sharply while current assets remained stable, enhancing liquidity and operational flexibility. These factors collectively indicate improved operational efficiency and effective cost control in 2024. | Operating margin decreased from 12.69% in 2022 to 7.89% in 2023, indicating reduced operational efficiency or increased operating costs relative to revenue. Asset turnover was high at 101.39%, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate sales. However, net cash from operations dropped sharply by over 50% from MYR 746,020 thousand to MYR 368,248 thousand, signaling potential challenges in cash generation from core business activities. Inventories increased by 15.3% to MYR 542,571 thousand, which may indicate higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Working capital dynamics show increased current liabilities outpacing current assets growth, which could pressure short-term operational liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency appears to have declined in 2023 with lower operating margins and cash flow generation despite strong asset utilization. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage decreased notably with the debt to equity ratio improving to 30.74% from 41.97%, reducing financial risk. Interest expense declined by 36.3% to MYR 22,196 thousand, while interest coverage ratio more than doubled to 2633.27%, indicating a strong ability to meet interest obligations. The effective tax rate slightly decreased, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax regulations but does not pose immediate risk. The significant reduction in current liabilities and improved current ratio to 420.84% reduces liquidity risk. However, the large negative net cash from financing activities (MYR -526,900 thousand) and continued negative net increase in cash (MYR -190,061 thousand) warrant monitoring for potential cash flow constraints. Overall, financial risk indicators improved in 2024 with lower leverage and stronger interest coverage, but cash flow from financing activities requires attention. | Leverage remained stable with a debt to equity ratio of 41.97%, consistent with the prior year, indicating no significant increase in financial risk from debt. However, the current ratio declined from 365.40% to 278.74%, reflecting a reduction in liquidity buffer due to rising current liabilities. Interest expense increased slightly from MYR 29,266 thousand to MYR 34,868 thousand, while interest coverage ratio decreased substantially from 2301.99% to 1158.79%, though still indicating strong ability to cover interest expenses. The effective tax rate increased marginally, which could impact net profitability. The significant increase in current liabilities and reduced cash flow from operations, combined with a large negative net cash from investing activities, suggest potential liquidity and refinancing risks if cash generation does not improve. Overall, financial risk remains moderate but warrants monitoring of liquidity and cash flow trends. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities showed a marked reduction in cash outflows from investing activities to MYR -321,567 thousand in 2024 from MYR -832,039 thousand in 2023, suggesting a slowdown in capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from operations increased substantially, supporting cash flow sustainability. However, net cash from financing activities was significantly negative at MYR -526,900 thousand, driven possibly by higher dividend payments (MYR -151,673 thousand, nearly triple 2023's amount) and debt repayments, indicating a focus on returning value to shareholders and deleveraging. Revenue growth was modest overall, but sales of oil palm based products increased by 6.3%, and revenue from the 'Others' geographic segment more than doubled, indicating potential new market expansion. Revenue from Malaysia and Asia-Pacific regions slightly declined, suggesting geographic shifts. These trends imply cautious growth with emphasis on operational cash flow and shareholder returns, while exploring new market opportunities for future performance. | The company invested heavily in 2023, as evidenced by net cash used in investing activities of MYR (832,039) thousand compared to a negligible amount in 2022, indicating a focus on growth or asset acquisition. Despite this, net cash from financing activities was minimal at MYR (11,609) thousand, suggesting limited external financing or debt repayment. The negative net increase in cash of MYR (475,400) thousand reflects the heavy investing outflows and reduced operational cash inflows, raising concerns about cash flow sustainability. Dividend payments decreased to MYR (53,417) thousand, indicating a more conservative dividend policy possibly to preserve cash. Revenue by geographic region shows strong sales in Asia-Pacific (MYR 3,044,501 thousand) and Malaysia (MYR 1,843,583 thousand), with smaller contributions from other regions, suggesting growth opportunities in these markets. Sales of oil palm based products amounted to MYR 1,394,895 thousand, highlighting a key product segment. Overall, the company appears to be investing for future growth with geographic and product focus, but must manage cash flow and liquidity carefully to sustain financial performance going forward. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The company operates as an integrated oil palm industry player with core businesses in upstream operations (plantation and milling) and downstream operations (refining, trading, and marketing of palm products).
