# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased steadily from RM1,454,834K in 2022 to RM1,690,195K in 2024, representing a growth of approximately 9.4% from 2022 to 2023 and 6.3% from 2023 to 2024. Gross profit showed an unusual pattern with RM905,988K in 2022, dropping slightly to RM897,030K in 2023, then surging to RM1,664,000K in 2024. The gross margin percentage reflects this anomaly, declining from 62.27% in 2022 to 56.38% in 2023, then jumping to an unrealistic 100.00% in 2024, likely due to the negative or misreported Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) figure in 2024 (RM -26,195K). Revenue by product/service in 2024 shows Data as the dominant segment at RM1,454,092K (86% of total revenue), slightly up from RM1,352,919K in 2023. Cloud and other services remained stable around RM185,000K, Voice revenue declined slightly from RM50,218K in 2023 to RM47,012K in 2024, and Others increased marginally. Geographically, revenue is heavily concentrated in Malaysia, increasing from RM1,520,391K in 2023 to RM1,614,587K in 2024, representing about 95.5% of total revenue in 2024, with outside Malaysia revenue growing modestly from RM70,559K to RM75,608K. Overall, revenue growth is steady but the gross margin data for 2024 is inconsistent, suggesting possible data issues or extraordinary cost adjustments affecting COGS. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from 34.54% in 2022 to 24.14% in 2023 and slightly improved to 26.09% in 2024, indicating some recovery but still below 2022 levels. Operating income decreased from RM502,572K in 2022 to RM384,123K in 2023, then increased to RM440,892K in 2024, tracking the margin trend. Operating expenses were stable between 2023 and 2024 at approximately RM1,223,000K but were significantly lower in 2022 at RM149,540K, which may indicate a reporting or classification anomaly. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that despite revenue growth, operating income did not increase proportionally, reflecting pressure on operational efficiency. Cost management appears challenged given the high and stable operating expenses against rising revenue, and the unusual 2024 COGS figure further complicates the assessment. Overall, operating efficiency shows some improvement in 2024 but remains below the 2022 benchmark. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 25.35% in 2022 to 32.98% in 2023, then decreased to 26.73% in 2024, indicating fluctuating tax burdens that could impact net profitability. Net profit margin shows extreme volatility, with an unusually high 161.85% in 2023, likely due to non-recurring items or data inconsistencies, as net profit in 2023 (RM2,574,905K) is disproportionately high compared to operating income (RM384,123K). In 2024, net profit margin normalized to 22.81%, more consistent with operating margin trends. The negative COGS in 2024 and the large net profit in 2023 suggest the presence of non-recurring gains or accounting adjustments affecting profitability. No explicit external factors are provided, but these anomalies imply one-off impacts or extraordinary items influencing reported results, which should be investigated further for accurate profitability assessment. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company’s total assets decreased to RM5,037,966 thousand from RM5,314,868 thousand in 2023, indicating a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a decline in current assets from RM2,011,054 thousand to RM1,657,181 thousand. Non-current assets slightly increased to RM3,380,785 thousand, suggesting some reinvestment or capital expenditure in long-term assets. Total liabilities decreased marginally to RM1,105,864 thousand from RM1,139,285 thousand, reflecting effective liability management. Current liabilities reduced from RM527,442 thousand to RM480,799 thousand, improving short-term solvency. However, non-current liabilities slightly increased to RM625,065 thousand. Shareholders’ equity declined to RM3,932,102 thousand from RM4,175,583 thousand, driven by a reduction in retained earnings from RM2,610,465 thousand to RM2,363,339 thousand, indicating lower accumulated profits. The current ratio decreased from 381.28% to 344.67%, still reflecting strong liquidity but a slight weakening. Debt to equity ratio increased slightly from 27.28% to 28.12%, showing a stable but slightly higher leverage. Overall, the company maintains a strong financial position with solid equity and manageable liabilities, though asset contraction and equity reduction warrant monitoring. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a strong financial position with total assets increasing significantly from RM4,189,389 thousand in 2022 to RM5,314,868 thousand, indicating robust asset growth primarily driven by a rise in non-current assets from RM2,380,256 thousand to RM3,303,814 thousand. Total liabilities increased moderately from RM1,061,659 thousand to RM1,139,285 thousand, with a notable rise in non-current liabilities from RM499,281 thousand to RM611,843 thousand, while current liabilities decreased slightly. Shareholders' equity strengthened substantially from RM3,127,730 thousand to RM4,175,583 thousand, supported by a large increase in retained earnings from RM1,611,489 thousand to RM2,610,465 thousand. Liquidity improved as reflected by the current ratio rising from 321.69% to 381.28%, indicating enhanced short-term financial stability. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 33.94% to 27.28%, suggesting improved capital structure with lower leverage relative to equity. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a solid and growing financial foundation with prudent liability management and strong equity growth in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by 6.2% from RM1,590,950 thousand in 2023 to RM1,690,195 thousand in 2024, driven mainly by growth in the Data segment and Malaysia geographic region. Gross profit surged to RM1,664,000 thousand from RM897,030 thousand, reflecting an unusual cost of goods sold figure of negative RM26,195 thousand in 2024, which may indicate accounting adjustments or inventory write-backs, resulting in a 100% gross margin. Operating income improved by 14.7% to RM440,892 thousand, with operating margin rising from 24.14% to 26.09%, showing better cost control at the operating level. However, net profit declined sharply to RM385,480 thousand from RM2,574,905 thousand in 2023, causing net profit margin to drop from 161.85% to 22.81%. This large discrepancy suggests one-time or non-operating items inflated 2023 net profit. Return on equity and assets also declined significantly to 9.51% and 7.45% respectively, from 70.51% and 54.18%, indicating lower earnings quality and sustainability despite revenue growth. Effective tax rate decreased to 26.73% from 32.98%, slightly improving after-tax profitability. Overall, while top-line and operating profitability improved, net earnings quality and returns weakened substantially in 2024. | Revenue increased by approximately 9.3% from RM1,454,834 thousand in 2022 to RM1,590,950 thousand in 2023, showing positive top-line growth. However, gross profit slightly declined from RM905,988 thousand to RM897,030 thousand, causing the gross margin to decrease from 62.27% to 56.38%, indicating increased cost of goods sold pressure. Operating income fell from RM502,572 thousand to RM384,123 thousand, with operating margin dropping from 34.54% to 24.14%, reflecting significantly higher operating expenses which surged from RM149,540 thousand to RM1,223,146 thousand. Despite this, net profit surged dramatically from RM453,610 thousand to RM2,574,905 thousand, resulting in an exceptional net profit margin of 161.85% compared to 31.18% in 2022. This discrepancy suggests extraordinary or non-operating income components boosting net profit. Return on equity and return on assets are strong at 70.51% and 54.18% respectively, indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate increased from 25.35% to 32.98%, slightly reducing after-tax profitability. Overall, profitability shows mixed signals with operational challenges but outstanding net earnings performance in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses remained nearly flat at RM1,223,108 thousand compared to RM1,223,146 thousand in 2023, demonstrating tight cost control despite revenue growth. Operating margin improved to 26.09% from 24.14%, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency. Asset turnover slightly declined to 32.65% from 33.48%, indicating marginally less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations decreased by 18.1% to RM628,775 thousand from RM767,899 thousand, suggesting some deterioration in cash generation relative to income. Working capital contracted as current assets fell more than current liabilities, consistent with the reduced current ratio. Overall, the company shows improved cost management and stable operating margins but faces challenges in maintaining cash flow and asset utilization efficiency. | Operational efficiency in 2023 appears challenged as operating expenses increased substantially, leading to a reduced operating margin of 24.14% from 34.54% in 2022. The asset turnover ratio is high at 33.48, indicating strong revenue generation relative to asset base, which is a positive sign of asset utilization. Net cash from operations remained stable, increasing slightly from RM755,784 thousand to RM767,899 thousand, supporting ongoing operational cash flow strength. Working capital improved as current assets increased to RM2,011,054 thousand while current liabilities decreased to RM527,442 thousand, enhancing liquidity and operational flexibility. Despite higher costs, the company maintained solid cash flow generation, but cost control appears to be an area requiring attention given the large rise in operating expenses. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remained stable with a slight increase in debt to equity ratio from 27.28% to 28.12%, indicating no significant change in financial risk from debt levels. Interest expense increased marginally to RM24,020 thousand from RM22,409 thousand, but interest coverage ratio improved to 1835.52% from 1714.15%, reflecting strong ability to service interest despite lower net profits. Liquidity indicators weakened slightly as current ratio declined from 381.28% to 344.67%, though still indicating strong short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate decreased to 26.73% from 32.98%, reducing tax burden risk. The negative cost of goods sold figure and sharp net profit decline may signal accounting or operational risks that require further investigation. Overall, financial risk remains low with strong interest coverage and manageable leverage, but some anomalies in profitability metrics warrant caution. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show a moderate risk profile. Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio fell from 33.94% to 27.28%, indicating reduced reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased from RM18,052 thousand to RM22,409 thousand, but interest coverage remains very strong at 1714.15%, down from 2784.02% in 2022, suggesting ample earnings to cover interest obligations despite the increase. The effective tax rate rose to 32.98%, which could impact net profitability if sustained. Liquidity is strong with a current ratio of 381.28%, reducing short-term liquidity risk. However, the significant increase in operating expenses and the disparity between operating income and net profit may warrant further scrutiny for potential financial risks or one-time items. Overall, the company maintains a low to moderate financial risk profile in 2023. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities sharply reduced as net cash from investing dropped to RM55,449 thousand from RM1,551,465 thousand in 2023, indicating a significant slowdown in capital expenditures or asset acquisitions. Net cash used in financing activities also decreased to RM(678,031) thousand from RM(1,613,108) thousand, reflecting lower debt repayments or dividend distributions. Dividends paid declined to RM(630,077) thousand from RM(1,570,377) thousand, suggesting a more conservative dividend policy aligned with lower net profits. Revenue growth in the Data segment and Malaysia region indicates continued market strength in core areas, while other segments remained stable or slightly declined. Cash flow sustainability is challenged by reduced operational cash inflows and lower investing and financing activities, implying cautious financial management. The company appears to be focusing on preserving cash and maintaining liquidity while navigating profitability challenges, which may moderate growth prospects in the near term. | Investment activities in 2023 show a positive cash inflow from investing activities of RM1,551,465 thousand compared to a cash outflow in 2022, indicating asset disposals or returns on investments that could support future growth. Net cash from financing activities was negative at RM1,613,108 thousand, reflecting significant dividend payments of RM1,570,377 thousand, which may impact cash reserves but signals a shareholder-friendly dividend policy. The net increase in cash of RM706,256 thousand suggests strong cash flow sustainability. Revenue concentration is primarily in Malaysia (RM1,520,391 thousand) with a smaller portion from outside Malaysia (RM70,559 thousand), indicating potential for geographic expansion. Product-wise, the majority of revenue comes from Data services (RM1,352,919 thousand), with smaller contributions from Cloud and other services, Voice, and Others, suggesting focus areas for growth. Overall, the company appears well-positioned for future financial performance with strong cash flows, active investment management, and a clear revenue base, though continued monitoring of operating expenses and geographic diversification could enhance growth prospects. |
