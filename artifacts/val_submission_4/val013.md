# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, the company's revenue grew significantly from IDR 9,126.799 million in 2022 to IDR 9,245,032 million in 2023 (approximately 1.3% growth), then surged to IDR 11,187,565 million in 2024 (about 21% growth from 2023). Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) increased from IDR 4,559.218 million in 2022 to IDR 4,685,871 million in 2023 (2.8% increase), then sharply to IDR 5,925,030 million in 2024 (26.5% increase from 2023). Gross profit rose from IDR 4,567.581 million in 2022 to IDR 4,559,161 million in 2023 (slight decrease), then to IDR 5,262,535 million in 2024 (15.5% increase). However, gross margin declined steadily from 50.05% in 2022 to 49.31% in 2023 and further to 47.04% in 2024, indicating rising direct costs relative to revenue. Revenue by product/service in 2024 shows Real Estate as the dominant segment with IDR 8,909.131 billion (79.6% of total revenue), growing from IDR 7,120.570 billion in 2023 (77% of revenue), indicating increased reliance on this segment. Rental revenue grew modestly from IDR 1,381.714 billion in 2023 to IDR 1,424.881 billion in 2024, while Others increased from IDR 742.748 billion to IDR 853.553 billion, showing diversification but with Real Estate as the main driver. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional analysis. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from IDR 3,062.626 million in 2022 to IDR 2,951,424 million in 2023 (a slight decrease in absolute terms, likely due to data scale inconsistency), then rose to IDR 3,447,050 million in 2024 (16.8% increase from 2023). Operating margin declined from 33.56% in 2022 to 31.92% in 2023 and further to 30.81% in 2024, reflecting a gradual erosion in operating efficiency despite revenue growth. Operating expenses increased from IDR 1,640.849 million in 2022 to IDR 1,767,700 million in 2023 (7.7% increase), then to IDR 1,956,600 million in 2024 (10.7% increase), indicating rising overheads. The ratio of operating income to revenue shows that while revenue expanded, cost management has not kept pace, leading to margin compression. Overall, the company shows growth but with declining operating efficiency and increasing cost pressures. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable but slightly decreased from 2.47% in 2022 to 2.65% in 2023, then to 2.43% in 2024, indicating consistent low tax burden with minor fluctuations. Income tax expense increased in absolute terms from IDR 56.914 million in 2022 to IDR 58,618 million in 2023 and IDR 65,863 million in 2024, consistent with rising profits. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the provided financials. External factors affecting profitability are not detailed, and geographic revenue data is missing, limiting assessment of external market impacts. The low and stable tax rate supports net profitability, which remains strong despite margin compressions. |

| Profitability and earnings quality | The company experienced strong revenue growth in 2024, with total revenue increasing by approximately 21% from IDR 9,245,032 million in 2023 to IDR 11,187,565 million. Gross profit also increased from IDR 4,559,161 million to IDR 5,262,535 million, though the gross margin declined from 49.31% to 47.04%, indicating some pressure on cost of goods sold which rose proportionally more.

Gross profit increased proportionally to IDR 4,559,161 million, though the gross margin slightly declined from 50.05% to 49.31%, suggesting marginally higher cost of goods sold relative to revenue. Operating income decreased slightly to IDR 2,951,424 million with operating margin contracting from 33.56% to 31.92%, reflecting increased operating expenses.

Return on equity and return on assets were reported at 8.46% and 4.29% respectively, providing moderate returns and suggesting sustainable profitability. The effective tax rate increased slightly to 2.65%, but remains low, supporting net earnings. Overall, profitability remains strong with significant revenue growth and stable net income, though margins show slight compression. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency showed mixed trends in 2024. The operating margin decreased slightly from 31.92% to 30.81%, indicating a modest increase in operating expenses relative to revenue. Asset turnover improved significantly from 21.46% to 24.55%, reflecting better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Inventories increased from IDR 12,119,621 million to IDR 12,537,622 million, a moderate rise that may indicate inventory buildup. Net cash from operations declined from IDR 3,864.8 million to IDR 2,985.5 million, signaling reduced cash generation despite higher profits, which could be due to working capital changes or timing differences. Working capital pressure is suggested by the increase in current liabilities outpacing current assets growth, contributing to a lower current ratio. Overall, while asset utilization improved, cost control and cash flow from operations warrant attention to sustain operational efficiency. | Operating expenses increased from IDR 1,640,849 million to IDR 1,767,700 million, contributing to a reduced operating margin.

Inventories increased modestly by about 4.1%, which may reflect inventory buildup aligned with revenue growth. Working capital remains strong with current assets outpacing current liabilities, as seen in the improved current ratio. Overall, the company maintained good cost control and asset utilization, with operational cash flows supporting ongoing business activities effectively. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators in 2024 show a stable but cautious profile. Leverage, as measured by the debt to equity ratio, improved slightly from 94.99% to 91.03%, indicating a modest reduction in reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased from IDR 1,208,782 million to IDR 1,359,173 million, but interest coverage ratio improved from 244.17% to 253.61%, reflecting strong earnings relative to interest obligations and low risk of default. Liquidity risk increased somewhat as the current ratio declined from 242.32% to 198.60%, driven by a rise in current liabilities. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, reducing tax burden risk. However, the decline in net cash from operations and negative net cash flow from investing activities raise concerns about cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company maintains strong coverage and manageable leverage but should monitor liquidity and cash flow trends closely. | Leverage decreased as the debt to equity ratio improved to 94.99% from 100.01%, indicating reduced financial risk. However, interest expense rose significantly from IDR 1,069,334 million to IDR 1,208,782 million, which, combined with a lower interest coverage ratio declining from 286.40% to 244.17%, suggests increased interest burden and slightly reduced ability to cover interest costs from operating income. The effective tax rate increased marginally, but remains low at 2.65%, posing minimal tax risk. Liquidity remains strong with a current ratio above 2.4, reducing short-term solvency risk. Overall, while leverage and liquidity are well managed, the rising interest expense and reduced interest coverage warrant monitoring for potential financial strain. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities intensified in 2024, with net cash used in investing activities increasing from negative IDR 1,176.3 million to negative IDR 2,751.2 million, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Despite this, net cash from financing activities improved, with lower outflows from IDR (1,140.2) million to IDR (634.5) million, possibly reflecting reduced debt repayments or financing costs. The company increased dividends substantially from IDR 278,035,000,000 to IDR 389,250,000,000, signaling confidence in cash flow sustainability and a shareholder-friendly policy. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the Real Estate segment, which increased from IDR 7,120,570 million to IDR 8,909,131 million, while Rental and Other segments showed modest growth. Geographic revenue data is unavailable, limiting regional trend analysis. Overall, the company appears positioned for continued growth supported by investment in assets and strong dividend payouts, though cash flow management will be critical to support these initiatives. | Investment activities show increased cash outflows from investing activities, rising from negative IDR 722.4 million to negative IDR 1,176.3 million, indicating higher capital expenditures or acquisitions that may support future growth. Net cash from financing activities remained negative and stable, suggesting ongoing debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends were maintained at a high level (IDR 278,035,000,000), reflecting a consistent dividend policy and shareholder return focus. Revenue by product shows a dominant contribution from Real Estate (IDR 7,120.570 billion), followed by Rental (IDR 1,381.714 billion) and Others (IDR 742.748 billion), indicating a diversified revenue base with a strong core segment. No geographic revenue data is available for 2023. The combination of sustained operational cash flow, ongoing investments, and stable dividends suggests the company is positioned for continued growth and shareholder value creation, though monitoring investment returns and financing costs will be important for future performance. |

Protectionist trade policies and high tariffs, especially by the US, have slowed growth in Europe and China, creating uncertainty among investors and worsening international trade relations. Domestically, while Indonesia's economy showed resilience with stable growth around 5%, challenges remain such as political year uncertainties, rising construction costs, licensing issues, and interest rate fluctuations impacting property development and sales. The residential property price growth slowed in Q4 2024, particularly for small and medium houses, influenced by lower construction material price growth and market demand shifts. The Company also faces financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk due to exposure to USD and SGD, and interest rate risk from floating rate bank loans. Inflation remains controlled below 2%, but cost pressures and market fluctuations continue to pose uncertainties.
