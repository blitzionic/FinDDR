# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2024, revenue increased from IDR 30,669.406 million to IDR 36,072.949 million, representing a compound growth of approximately 17.6% over two years. The growth from 2022 to 2023 was modest at 2.6%, accelerating to 14.5% from 2023 to 2024. Gross profit rose from IDR 6,839.423 million in 2022 to IDR 8,302.299 million in 2024, but gross margin declined sharply from an anomalous -77,699,524,398.39% in 2022 (likely a data error) to a more realistic 26.70% in 2023 and then to 23.02% in 2024, indicating some margin compression in the latest year. Revenue by product shows that packaged food processing revenue increased from approximately IDR 18,577.8 billion in 2022 to IDR 21,721.7 billion in 2024, a 16.9% increase, while packaged beverages processing revenue grew from IDR 12,091.6 billion to IDR 14,351.2 billion, an 18.7% increase, indicating balanced growth across both segments. Geographically, Indonesia remains the largest market, growing from IDR 17,304.3 billion in 2022 to IDR 20,712.0 billion in 2024 (19.7% growth), while Asia also grew from IDR 12,595.5 billion to IDR 14,381.3 billion (14.1% growth). The 'Lain-lain' category increased from IDR 769.7 billion to IDR 979.6 billion (27.3% growth), showing diversification in revenue sources. Overall, revenue growth is solid with expanding geographic and product footprints, though gross margin pressure in 2024 suggests rising direct costs or pricing challenges. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from IDR 2,433.115 million in 2022 to IDR 3,915.365 million in 2024, a 60.9% increase over two years. Operating margin improved from 7.93% in 2022 to 13.66% in 2023 but then declined to 10.85% in 2024, indicating some deterioration in operating efficiency in the latest year. Operating expenses in 2024 were IDR 4,386.935 million, slightly higher than 2023's IDR 4,108.302 million, reflecting a 6.8% increase, which is below revenue growth, suggesting some cost control. However, the decline in operating margin in 2024 despite revenue growth implies that cost of goods sold or other operational costs increased disproportionately. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that while absolute operating income grew, the efficiency of converting revenue into operating profit weakened in 2024. This may point to challenges in managing direct costs or operational leverage under changing market conditions. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable over the period, at 21.39% in 2022, 20.74% in 2023, and 20.96% in 2024, indicating consistent tax expense management with no significant tax rate shocks. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the data provided, and the tax expense trends align with net profit changes, suggesting no major one-off tax impacts. External factors affecting profitability are not detailed in the data; however, the margin compression in 2024 could be influenced by external cost pressures or market conditions not specified here. The stable tax rate and absence of non-recurring items imply that profitability trends are primarily driven by operational performance rather than external or one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated significant asset growth with total assets increasing from IDR 23,870,404,962,472 million in 2023 to IDR 29,728,781,933,757 million, reflecting a strong expansion in asset base. Current assets rose notably from IDR 14,738,922,387,529 million to IDR 19,600,914,916,989 million, while non-current assets also increased moderately. However, total liabilities grew substantially from IDR 8,588,315,775,736 million to IDR 12,626,353,599,187 million, driven mainly by a sharp rise in current liabilities from IDR 4,013,200,501,414 million to IDR 7,383,110,635,195 million. Shareholders' equity improved from IDR 15,282,089,186,736 million to IDR 17,102,428,334,570 million, supported by increased retained earnings. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 367.26% to 265.48%, indicating reduced short-term liquidity but still a comfortable buffer. The debt to equity ratio increased from 56.20% to 73.83%, suggesting higher leverage and a shift towards more debt financing. Overall, the balance sheet shows growth and strengthening equity but with increased leverage and somewhat reduced liquidity in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a stronger financial position compared to 2022. Total assets increased from IDR 22,276,160,695,411 to IDR 23,870,404,962,472, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets (from IDR 7,503,536,719,283 to IDR 9,131,482,574,943) while current assets slightly decreased. Total liabilities decreased from IDR 9,441,466,604,896 to IDR 8,588,315,775,736, with a notable reduction in current liabilities (from IDR 5,636,627,301,308 to IDR 4,013,200,501,414) but an increase in non-current liabilities (from IDR 3,804,839,303,588 to IDR 4,575,115,274,322). Shareholders' equity improved significantly from IDR 12,834,694,090,515 to IDR 15,282,089,186,736, supported by higher retained earnings (from IDR 12,136,012,917,053 to IDR 14,552,037,812,134). Liquidity strengthened as reflected by the current ratio rising from 262.08% to 367.26%, indicating enhanced short-term financial stability. The debt to equity ratio improved from 73.56% to 56.20%, signaling better leverage management and a more conservative capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet reflects asset growth, liability reduction, and stronger equity, underpinning solid financial health in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased by approximately 14.6% from IDR 31,485,008 million in 2023 to IDR 36,072,949 million in 2024, indicating solid top-line growth. However, gross profit slightly decreased from IDR 8,407,778 million to IDR 8,302,299 million, causing the gross margin to decline from 26.70% to 23.02%. Operating income fell from IDR 4,299,475 million to IDR 3,915,365 million, with operating margin dropping from 13.66% to 10.85%, reflecting increased operating expenses. Net profit decreased from IDR 3,244,872 million to IDR 3,068,000 million, and net profit margin declined from 10.31% to 8.50%, indicating margin compression and lower profitability despite revenue growth. Income tax expense and effective tax rate remained relatively stable. Return on equity and return on assets are reported as 0.00%, which may indicate data unavailability or calculation issues, limiting assessment of earnings sustainability. Overall, earnings quality shows pressure from rising costs and margin erosion in 2024 despite revenue growth. | The company’s profitability improved markedly in 2023. Revenue increased modestly from IDR 30,669.406 million to IDR 31,485.008 million. Gross profit rose significantly from IDR 6,839.423 million to IDR 8,407.778 million, resulting in a gross margin of 26.70% in 2023 compared to an anomalous figure in 2022. Operating income nearly doubled from IDR 2,433.115 million to IDR 4,299.475 million, lifting the operating margin from 7.93% to 13.66%. Net profit increased substantially from IDR 1,970.065 million to IDR 3,244.872 million, with net profit margin improving from 6.42% to 10.31%. Income before taxes and income tax expense also increased, but the effective tax rate slightly decreased from 21.39% to 20.74%, supporting higher net earnings. Return on equity and return on assets are reported as 0.00%, likely due to data limitations, but the strong margin improvements and net profit growth indicate enhanced earnings quality and sustainability in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased from IDR 4,108,302 million in 2023 to IDR 4,386,935 million in 2024, contributing to a reduced operating margin. Cost of goods sold rose significantly, outpacing revenue growth, which negatively impacted gross profit. Asset turnover is reported as 0.00%, indicating unavailable or uncalculated data, limiting analysis of asset utilization. Net cash from operations turned sharply negative in 2024 at IDR (463,359,497) million compared to a positive IDR 5,259,181,990 million in 2023, signaling operational cash flow challenges. Inventories nearly doubled from IDR 3,556,864,427 million to IDR 6,437,101,615 million, which may indicate inventory buildup and potential inefficiencies in working capital management. Overall, operational efficiency appears to have deteriorated in 2024 with higher costs, negative operating cash flow, and increased inventory levels. | Operational efficiency improved in 2023 as evidenced by a higher operating margin of 13.66% compared to 7.93% in 2022, reflecting better cost control and expense management with operating expenses decreasing from IDR 4,406.309 million to IDR 4,108.302 million despite revenue growth. Inventory levels decreased from IDR 3,870.496 billion to IDR 3,556.864 billion, indicating improved inventory management. Net cash from operations surged from IDR 1,619,000,000,000 to IDR 5,259,181,989,696, demonstrating strong cash generation capability. However, asset turnover and return ratios are reported as 0.00%, suggesting incomplete data for turnover analysis. Overall, the company enhanced operational efficiency through improved margins, better working capital management, and significantly stronger operating cash flows in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased notably in 2024, with the debt to equity ratio rising from 56.20% to 73.83%, reflecting higher reliance on debt financing. Current liabilities surged, impacting liquidity as the current ratio declined from 367.26% to 265.48%, though still indicating a strong liquidity position. Interest expense increased from IDR 302,577 million to IDR 425,196 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased from 1420.95% to 920.84%, showing reduced but still comfortable ability to cover interest payments. The effective tax rate remained stable around 21%, indicating no significant tax risk changes. The sharp negative net cash from operations and increased current liabilities may signal early warning signs of liquidity stress if trends continue. Overall, financial risk has increased due to higher leverage and reduced liquidity, warranting close monitoring. | Financial risk indicators improved in 2023. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 73.56% to 56.20%, indicating reduced leverage and lower financial risk. Interest expense declined from IDR 389,182,677,897 to IDR 302.577 million, while interest coverage ratio dramatically improved to 1420.95%, reflecting a strong ability to meet interest obligations from operating income. The current ratio increased to 367.26%, signaling excellent liquidity and short-term solvency. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 20.74%, which may marginally improve net profitability. Despite an increase in non-current liabilities, the overall liability management and liquidity position suggest a lower risk profile in 2023 with no immediate warning signs of financial distress. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show continued cash outflows from investing activities, though reduced from IDR (2,359,457,242) million in 2023 to IDR (1,628,862,779) million in 2024, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions. Financing cash flow turned positive at IDR 2,428,387,225 million in 2024 from negative in 2023, suggesting new debt or equity inflows supporting growth or liquidity. Dividends increased in payout from IDR (782,554,490) million to IDR (1,229,728,485) million, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns despite operational cash flow challenges. Revenue growth in key segments such as packaged food processing and packaged beverages processing, as well as geographic expansion in Indonesia and Asia, indicate positive market trends supporting future growth. However, negative operating cash flow and rising inventories may pressure cash flow sustainability. The company appears positioned for growth with investments and financing support but must address operational cash flow and working capital management to ensure future financial stability. | Investment activities intensified in 2023 as net cash used in investing increased from IDR (1,546,000,000,000) to IDR (2,359,457,241,900), indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions to support growth. Net cash from financing activities showed a larger outflow of IDR (1,975,978,291,736) compared to the prior year, possibly reflecting debt repayments or dividend payments, with dividends increasing from IDR (469,532,694,225) to IDR (782,554,490,375), signaling a shareholder-friendly dividend policy. Revenue growth was supported by increases in both major product segments: packaged food processing revenue rose from IDR 18,577,821,248,451 to IDR 18,966,064,907,406 and packaged beverages processing from IDR 12,091,584,718,953 to IDR 12,518,943,278,119. Geographically, revenue from Indonesia and Asia increased, while other regions declined slightly, suggesting focus on core markets. The strong operational cash flow and improved profitability combined with ongoing investments position the company for sustainable growth, though continued monitoring of investing outflows and financing structure is advised. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Company faces significant economic challenges including rising costs of key raw materials such as coffee and cocoa, which directly increase production costs. Domestic economic conditions have not allowed proportional increases in selling prices, pressuring profitability. Political instability in several countries has also increased export distribution costs. Global economic instability, including threats of recession, monetary policy tightening at the global level, and geopolitical tensions, affect supply chains, import and export performance, and overall business operations. Exchange rate fluctuations, particularly weakening of the Rupiah, create uncertainty in production costs and pricing due to reliance on imported raw materials or locally sourced materials priced according to international markets. High global interest rates impact financing costs, especially floating loan interest rates, adding to financial uncertainty. The Company must also navigate government policies affecting purchasing power, production, transportation costs, and regulatory changes domestically and internationally. Despite these challenges, projections from IMF and World Bank indicate moderate global and Indonesian economic growth in 2025, supported by policy reforms, digitalization, and strategic investments. The Company adopts adaptive business strategies to manage these economic risks and maintain stability and growth. | The Company faces significant economic challenges in 2023 including the economic conditions of export target countries and the purchasing power of domestic consumers. Global issues such as food crises caused by climate change and international political instability pose serious concerns. Fluctuations in raw material prices and increased distribution or delivery costs threaten to destabilize global supply chains. The Company is also impacted by macroeconomic factors such as tight global monetary policy leading to high interest rates, exchange rate volatility especially weakening of the Rupiah, and risks from changes in government policies affecting production costs and consumer purchasing power. The ongoing geopolitical tensions and threat of recession globally add to uncertainties affecting import and export performance. Despite a price spike in raw materials in 2022, prices fell in 2023 with hopes for normalization in 2024 if global conditions improve. Domestic political events like the 2024 simultaneous elections may increase public spending and influence macroeconomic indicators. The Company must remain vigilant to these economic fluctuations and uncertainties to minimize risks and maintain growth. |
