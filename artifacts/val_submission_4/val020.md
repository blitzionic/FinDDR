# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue declined from £26,458m in 2023 to £19,913m in 2024, a decrease of 24.7%, after growing 11.4% from 2022 to 2023. Gross profit fell sharply from £9,623m in 2023 to £4,087m in 2024, a 57.5% drop, despite a reported gross margin increase to 156.77% in 2024 from 138.49% in 2023, indicating possible data or classification anomalies. Revenue by product shows significant declines in British Gas Energy (down £5,677m or 32.0%) and Centrica Energy (down £1,533m or 21.1%) from 2023 to 2024, while Upstream revenue increased substantially from £1,505m to £1,607m (+6.7%). British Gas Services & Solutions and Bord Gáis Energy also declined moderately. Geographically, UK revenue dropped sharply by £5,967m (26.9%) from 2023 to 2024, Republic of Ireland revenue decreased by £417m (29.0%), and Europe (excluding UK and Ireland) declined by £310m (17.9%). However, Rest of the World revenue increased by £149m (13.8%), indicating some geographic diversification or growth outside core markets. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income decreased dramatically from £6,512m in 2023 to £1,703m in 2024, a 73.8% decline, reflecting the revenue drop and cost pressures. Operating margin fell from a strong 24.61% in 2023 to 8.55% in 2024, though it improved from a negative margin of (1.01%) in 2022. Operating expenses decreased from £3,319m in 2023 to £2,640m in 2024 (-20.4%), showing some cost management efforts, but not enough to offset revenue declines. The relationship between operating income and revenue weakened significantly in 2024, indicating deteriorated operational efficiency and profitability despite lower operating expenses. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate improved substantially from (37.59%) in 2023 to (18.70%) in 2024, reducing the tax benefit impact on profitability. In 2022, the tax rate was a positive 66.06%, indicating a tax expense that year. The negative tax rates in 2023 and 2024 suggest tax credits or deferred tax benefits positively impacting net profit. No explicit non-recurring items are reported, but the large swings in tax rates and margins suggest possible one-off tax adjustments or external factors such as market volatility or regulatory changes affecting profitability. The sharp revenue and profit declines in 2024 may also reflect external market conditions impacting demand and pricing. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company experienced a contraction in total assets, declining from £21,366m in 2023 to £18,733m, indicating a reduction in asset base by approximately 12.3%. Both current and non-current assets decreased, with current assets falling from £16,066m to £14,144m and non-current assets from £5,300m to £4,589m. Total liabilities also decreased significantly from £17,133m to £13,921m, reflecting effective liability management and a reduction of about 18.7%. Current liabilities dropped from £11,136m to £8,902m, and non-current liabilities from £5,997m to £5,019m. Shareholders' equity improved from £3,877m to £4,422m, supported by an increase in retained earnings from £3,274m to £3,979m, indicating strengthening equity position despite the asset contraction. Liquidity improved as evidenced by the current ratio rising from 144.27% to 158.89%, suggesting better short-term financial health. The debt to equity ratio improved markedly from 441.91% to 314.81%, reflecting a more balanced capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the company’s financial position in 2024 shows a stronger equity base and improved liquidity, though asset contraction signals cautious capital deployment or asset divestment. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a stronger financial position compared to 2022. Total assets decreased from £29,038m to £21,366m, driven by a significant reduction in non-current assets from £8,350m to £5,300m, while current assets nearly doubled from £8,450m to £16,066m, indicating a shift towards more liquid assets. Total liabilities decreased substantially from £27,758m to £17,133m, with current liabilities slightly increasing from £10,016m to £11,136m but non-current liabilities remaining relatively stable. Shareholders' equity improved markedly from £1,017m to £3,877m, supported by a turnaround in retained earnings from a negative £466m to a positive £3,274m. The current ratio improved significantly to 144.27% from 84.37%, reflecting enhanced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio, while still high, improved drastically from 2,729.40% to 441.91%, indicating better leverage management and a stronger equity base. Overall, the balance sheet shows improved liquidity, reduced leverage, and a healthier equity position in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company’s revenue declined sharply by 24.7%, from £26,458m in 2023 to £19,913m in 2024. Despite this, the gross margin increased from 138.49% to 156.77%, indicating improved gross profitability relative to revenue, possibly due to cost structure changes or product mix. However, operating income fell drastically from £6,512m to £1,703m, causing the operating margin to compress from 24.61% to 8.55%. Net profit also declined significantly from £4,040m to £1,365m, with net profit margin dropping from 15.27% to 6.85%, reflecting lower bottom-line profitability. Return on equity (ROE) decreased sharply from 165.10% to 32.90%, and return on assets (ROA) declined from 16.03% to 6.81%, indicating reduced earnings efficiency and asset utilization in generating profits. The effective tax rate halved from 37.59% to 18.70%, which partially cushioned net income. Overall, earnings quality in 2024 weakened with lower revenue and profits, despite improved gross margins, signaling challenges in sustaining profitability at prior levels. | The company exhibited a strong profitability recovery in 2023. Revenue increased by 11.4% from £23,741m in 2022 to £26,458m in 2023. Gross profit surged from £2,045m to £9,623m, despite a decrease in cost of goods sold from -£12,630m to -£10,185m, resulting in a high gross margin of 138.49%, slightly lower than 153.20% in 2022 but still robust. Operating income turned positive at £6,512m compared to a loss of £240m in 2022, with operating margin improving from -1.01% to 24.61%. Net profit swung from a loss of £636m to a profit of £4,040m, yielding a net profit margin of 15.27% versus -2.68% previously. Return on equity was strong at 165.10%, and return on assets was 16.03%, indicating efficient use of equity and assets to generate earnings. The effective tax rate was negative at -37.59%, reflecting tax benefits or credits impacting earnings quality. Overall, 2023 shows a significant turnaround in profitability and earnings sustainability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses decreased from £3,319m to £2,640m, reflecting some cost control efforts. However, the operating margin contraction to 8.55% from 24.61% indicates that cost reductions were insufficient to offset revenue declines. Asset turnover slightly decreased from 104.98% to 99.32%, showing a marginal decline in how efficiently assets generate revenue. Net cash from operations dropped significantly from £2,752m to £1,149m, indicating reduced cash generation capacity from core business activities. Inventories decreased from £1,079m to £904m, which may reflect tighter inventory management or lower sales demand. Working capital improved as current assets and current liabilities both declined, but the current ratio increase to 158.89% suggests better short-term liquidity. Overall, operational efficiency weakened in 2024 due to lower cash flow generation and reduced asset utilization, despite some cost containment. | Operational efficiency improved markedly in 2023. Operating expenses increased from -£2,378m to -£3,319m, but this was more than offset by the substantial increase in gross profit and operating income. The operating margin rose to 24.61% from a negative margin in 2022, indicating better cost control relative to revenue. Asset turnover was very high at 104.98%, suggesting excellent utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations more than doubled from £1,314m to £2,752m, reflecting strong cash generation capability. Inventories decreased slightly from £1,269m to £1,079m, which may indicate improved inventory management. Working capital improved as current assets increased significantly while current liabilities rose moderately, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, the company enhanced its operational efficiency through improved margins, asset utilization, and cash flow generation in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage decreased as debt to equity ratio improved from 441.91% to 314.81%, indicating reduced financial risk from lower relative debt levels. Interest expense slightly increased from £308m to £337m, but interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 505.34%, down from an exceptionally high 2,114.29% in 2023, still indicating ample earnings to cover interest obligations. The effective tax rate dropped significantly from 37.59% to 18.70%, which may reflect tax planning or changes in tax environment, reducing tax burden risk. Liquidity risk appears mitigated with an improved current ratio of 158.89%. However, the sharp decline in operating income and net profit could pose earnings volatility risk. Overall, financial risk in 2024 is lower in terms of leverage and liquidity, but earnings volatility and slightly higher interest expense warrant monitoring. | Financial risk indicators improved but some risks remain. Leverage decreased significantly as debt to equity improved from 2,729.40% to 441.91%, reflecting reduced reliance on debt and stronger equity. Interest expense increased from -£220m to -£308m, but interest coverage ratio improved dramatically to 2,114.29% from 109.09%, indicating the company’s earnings comfortably cover interest obligations. The current ratio improved to 144.27%, signaling strong short-term liquidity. The effective tax rate was negative at -37.59%, which may indicate tax credits or deferred tax assets but also introduces some uncertainty in tax expense predictability. Overall, the company’s financial risk profile improved with better leverage and liquidity, though the unusual tax rate and increased interest expense warrant monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities showed a positive net cash inflow from investing of £493m in 2024, up from £115m in 2023, suggesting increased asset sales or divestments rather than capital expenditures, which may constrain future growth. Net cash from financing outflows increased slightly from £1,414m to £1,548m, with dividends rising from £186m to £219m, indicating a commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings. Revenue by product and geographic segments declined notably in key areas such as British Gas Energy (from £17,742m to £12,065m) and UK region revenue (from £22,207m to £16,240m), signaling potential market contraction or competitive pressures. However, some segments like Upstream revenue increased slightly from £1,505m to £1,607m, and Rest of the World revenue rose from £1,080m to £1,229m, indicating selective growth areas. Cash flow sustainability is challenged by reduced operational cash generation, but dividend policy remains intact. Future performance will depend on managing revenue declines in core markets and leveraging growth in emerging segments while maintaining capital discipline. | Investment and growth indicators suggest positive future performance. Net cash from investing activities turned positive at £115m in 2023 compared to an outflow of -£566m in 2022, indicating possible asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities increased in outflow to -£1,414m from -£917m, with dividends paid rising from -£59m to -£186m, reflecting a more aggressive dividend policy supported by improved earnings. Revenue growth was driven by key segments such as British Gas Energy increasing from £13,096m to £17,742m and Centrica Business Solutions from £2,981m to £3,516m, while geographic revenue growth was strong in the UK from £17,480m to £22,207m. However, revenue from the Rest of the World declined from £2,598m to £1,080m, indicating potential geographic concentration risk. The strong operational cash flow and improved profitability support sustainable dividend payments and potential reinvestment. Overall, the company is positioned for continued growth with improved cash flow sustainability and focused geographic and segment expansion. |
