# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue showed a volatile trend: it decreased from $5,390m in 2022 to $3,751m in 2023 (-30.4%), then surged to $6,226m in 2024 (+65.9%). Gross profit mirrored this pattern, dropping from $2,545m in 2022 to $1,375m in 2023 (-46%), then rebounding to $2,613m in 2024 (+90%). Correspondingly, gross margin declined sharply from 47.22% in 2022 to 36.66% in 2023, before partially recovering to 41.97% in 2024, indicating fluctuating cost control or pricing power. Product/service revenue in 2024 was nearly evenly split between crude oil sales ($2,878m) and gas sales ($2,936m), both showing strong growth from 2023 levels ($2,086m and $1,415m respectively), with condensate and other revenues contributing smaller amounts. Geographic revenue distribution shifted significantly: in 2023, UK dominated with $3,529m and Southeast Asia $237m, while in 2024, UK increased to $3,917m, Norway emerged strongly at $1,465m, and other regions like Germany, Mexico, Argentina, North Africa, and Corporate segments contributed notable revenues, indicating geographic diversification and expansion. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin declined from a robust 47.14% in 2022 to 24.85% in 2023, then slightly improved to 26.47% in 2024, reflecting reduced operational efficiency or increased costs relative to revenue. Operating income followed revenue trends, dropping from $2,541m in 2022 to $932m in 2023 (-63.3%), then rising to $1,648m in 2024 (+76.8%). Operating expenses increased from $121m in 2022 to $149m in 2023 and further to $352m in 2024, indicating rising overhead or investment in operations, which may have pressured margins despite revenue growth. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows that while revenue rebounded strongly in 2024, operating income did not fully recover to 2022 levels, suggesting some inefficiencies or higher costs impacting profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate was negative and highly volatile: 99.68% in 2022, then sharply negative at (92.69%) in 2023 and (107.63%) in 2024, indicating significant tax benefits or adjustments that materially affected net profit. Income tax expense figures show a reversal from a positive $2,454m in 2022 to negative $(571)m in 2023 and $(1,312)m in 2024, suggesting non-recurring tax credits or deferred tax asset recognition. Net profit margin was minimal and volatile, from 0.15% in 2022 to 1.20% in 2023, then turning negative to (1.49%) in 2024, despite strong operating income, highlighting the substantial impact of tax and possibly other one-off items on bottom-line profitability. No explicit non-recurring items are detailed, but the tax and net profit patterns imply significant external or one-off factors influencing reported earnings. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company exhibits significant asset growth, with total assets increasing sharply from $9,897 million in 2023 to $30,321 million. This growth is primarily driven by a substantial rise in non-current assets from $8,081 million to $26,410 million, indicating major investments or acquisitions. Total liabilities also increased markedly from $8,357 million to $24,070 million, with both current liabilities ($2,212 million to $5,614 million) and non-current liabilities ($6,145 million to $18,456 million) rising substantially. Despite this, shareholders' equity improved from $1,540 million to $6,251 million, reflecting a stronger equity base. However, retained earnings decreased from $1,080 million to $807 million, suggesting some earnings retention challenges. Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, declined from 82.10% to 69.67%, indicating a relative reduction in short-term asset coverage of current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio improved from 542.66% to 385.06%, showing better leverage management but still a high reliance on debt financing. Overall, the balance sheet shows aggressive growth financed by increased liabilities but with a strengthened equity position, though liquidity pressures have increased. | In 2023, the company experienced a contraction in total assets to $9,897 million from $12,566 million in 2022, indicating a reduction in asset base primarily driven by a decline in non-current assets from $10,439 million to $8,081 million. Total liabilities also decreased significantly from $11,545 million to $8,357 million, reflecting effective liability management and deleveraging efforts. Current liabilities were nearly halved from $4,096 million to $2,212 million, improving short-term financial stability. Shareholders' equity increased from $1,021 million to $1,540 million, strengthening the equity position despite a decline in retained earnings from $1,456 million to $1,080 million. The current ratio improved markedly from 51.93% to 82.10%, indicating enhanced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio was reduced substantially from 1130.75% to 542.66%, signaling a more balanced capital structure and lower financial risk. Overall, the company’s financial health in 2023 shows a stronger balance sheet with improved liquidity and reduced leverage, despite a smaller asset base. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue surged significantly by 65.9% from $3,751 million in 2023 to $6,226 million in 2024, driven by strong increases in crude oil and gas sales as well as expanded geographic diversification. Gross profit nearly doubled from $1,375 million to $2,613 million, improving the gross margin from 36.66% to 41.97%, indicating better cost control or pricing power. Operating income rose from $932 million to $1,648 million, lifting the operating margin slightly from 24.85% to 26.47%. However, net profit turned negative, with a net loss of $93 million in 2024 compared to a net profit of $45 million in 2023, resulting in a negative net profit margin of (1.49)%. This deterioration is largely due to a sharp increase in income tax expense from a negative $571 million to a negative $1,312 million, and higher interest expense ($42 million to $78 million). Return on equity and return on assets both turned negative, from 3.51% to (2.39%) and 0.40% to (0.46%) respectively, indicating earnings quality and sustainability issues despite top-line growth and improved operating profitability. | Revenue declined sharply by approximately 30% from $5,390 million in 2022 to $3,751 million in 2023, with gross profit falling from $2,545 million to $1,375 million. Gross margin contracted from 47.22% to 36.66%, reflecting increased cost pressures or lower pricing power. Operating income dropped significantly from $2,541 million to $932 million, with operating margin decreasing from 47.14% to 24.85%, indicating reduced operational profitability. However, net profit improved from a marginal $8 million in 2022 to $45 million in 2023, lifting net profit margin from 0.15% to 1.20%. This improvement in net profit despite lower operating income is influenced by a negative income tax expense of $(571) million in 2023 compared to a large tax expense in 2022, resulting in an effective tax rate swing from 99.68% to (92.69%). Interest expense decreased substantially from $358 million to $42 million, improving earnings quality. Return on equity and return on assets, previously unavailable, are positive in 2023 at 3.51% and 0.40% respectively, indicating modest but improved earnings sustainability. |
| Operational efficiency | The company improved its operating margin from 24.85% in 2023 to 26.47% in 2024, reflecting better cost control relative to revenue growth. However, asset turnover declined from 33.40% to 30.96%, suggesting that asset utilization efficiency has slightly worsened despite the large asset base expansion. Net cash from operations decreased from $2,144 million to $1,615 million, indicating lower cash generation relative to revenue growth, which may reflect working capital changes or operational cash flow challenges. Inventories increased from $200 million to $368 million, which could imply higher stock levels or slower inventory turnover. Overall, while operating profitability improved, operational efficiency in asset utilization and cash flow generation has weakened. | Operating expenses increased slightly from $121 million to $149 million despite lower revenue, contributing to margin compression. Asset turnover in 2023 is high at 33.40, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue, although no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations declined from $3,130 million to $2,144 million, reflecting lower revenue and profitability but still generating positive operating cash flow. Working capital improved as current assets decreased moderately from $2,127 million to $1,816 million while current liabilities decreased more significantly, enhancing liquidity. Inventories increased from $143 million to $200 million, which may suggest stockpiling or slower inventory turnover. Overall, the company maintained operational cash flow generation and improved asset utilization despite revenue and profit declines, but cost control pressures are evident. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage remains high but improved, with the debt to equity ratio decreasing from 542.66% to 385.06%, indicating reduced but still significant financial risk. The current ratio declined from 82.10% to 69.67%, signaling tighter liquidity and potential short-term solvency concerns. Interest expense nearly doubled from $42 million to $78 million, but interest coverage remains extremely strong at 2,112.82%, only slightly lower than 2,219.05% in 2023, suggesting the company can comfortably meet interest obligations. The effective tax rate worsened from (92.69)% to (107.63)%, reflecting unusual tax expense or adjustments that negatively impact net profitability. These factors combined indicate elevated financial risk due to high leverage, reduced liquidity, and tax-related earnings volatility. | Leverage risk has decreased substantially as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio dropping from 1130.75% to 542.66%, and total liabilities falling by over 27%. Liquidity risk is reduced with the current ratio improving from 51.93% to 82.10%, indicating better coverage of short-term obligations. Interest coverage ratio surged from 709.78% to 2219.05%, reflecting significantly lower interest expense and improved ability to meet interest payments. The effective tax rate swung dramatically from nearly 100% to a negative rate of (92.69%), which may indicate tax credits or deferred tax benefits but also introduces uncertainty in tax expense predictability. The large negative income tax expense and the sharp decline in revenue and assets could signal potential risks in earnings quality and sustainability. Overall, financial risk has diminished due to deleveraging and improved liquidity, but tax and earnings volatility warrant monitoring. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities intensified in 2024, with net cash used in investing increasing from $(693) million to $(2,277) million, consistent with the large increase in non-current assets. Financing cash flow turned positive to $1,229 million from a negative $(1,667) million in 2023, indicating new capital inflows or debt issuance supporting growth. The net increase in cash was positive at $567 million, improving liquidity buffers. Dividends slightly increased from $(190) million to $(199) million, showing a stable dividend policy despite net losses. Revenue growth was broad-based geographically, with new or expanded sales in Norway, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, and North Africa, alongside strong UK sales, suggesting diversification and growth potential in multiple markets. However, the negative net profit and declining cash from operations raise concerns about earnings sustainability. Overall, the company is aggressively investing for growth with supportive financing and geographic expansion, but must address profitability and cash flow challenges to ensure future financial performance stability. | Investment activities remained consistent with net cash used in investing slightly increasing from $(629) million to $(693) million, indicating ongoing capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities improved from $(2,674) million to $(1,667) million, suggesting reduced debt repayments or lower dividend payouts, with dividends stable around $(190) million. The company’s revenue in 2023 was concentrated in the UK ($3,529 million) and crude oil ($2,086 million) and gas ($1,415 million) product lines, with minimal or no revenue from other geographic regions or products, indicating geographic and product concentration risk but also focus. The negative net increase in cash of $(216) million suggests cash outflow pressures continue. Given the improved liquidity, reduced leverage, and ongoing investment, the company appears positioned for cautious growth, but the significant revenue decline and tax volatility may constrain near-term performance. Monitoring geographic and product diversification and sustaining operational cash flow will be critical for future financial stability. |


## S3.3: Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | The company's primary business model is the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and gas reserves and related activities. It generates revenue primarily through the sale of hydrocarbons including crude oil, natural gas, and condensate. Revenue streams also include tariff income and other related income such as partner recoveries and government subsidies. The company operates geographically across nine Business Units (Norway, UK, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, North Africa, Southeast Asia, CCS, and Corporate) and leverages a full cycle capability to strengthen its portfolio. The business model includes active commodity price risk management through hedging strategies, with a balanced portfolio of oil and gas production. The company also invests in carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects as part of its portfolio diversification and long-term value creation. Revenue in 2024 was $6,226 million, driven by higher production volumes and commodity prices, notably after the acquisition of Wintershall Dea assets. The company focuses on maintaining competitive operating costs, safe and responsible operations, and financial discipline to ensure resilience through commodity price cycles. | The company's primary business model is the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and gas reserves and related activities. It generates revenue primarily through the sale of hydrocarbons including crude oil, natural gas, and condensate. Revenue is recognized from contracts with customers when control of the goods transfers, mainly at a point in time. The company operates geographically in two main business units: the North Sea (UK and Norwegian continental shelves) and International (Indonesia, Vietnam, and Mexico). Revenue streams include crude oil sales, gas sales (split between UK and international gas), condensate sales, tariff income, and other related income such as partner recoveries and receipts from development agreements. The company also pursues value-accretive mergers and acquisitions to grow and diversify its portfolio. It focuses on capital discipline, sustainability, and efficient operations to maximize value and cash flow from existing assets. Strategic partnerships and supply chain management are key to operational efficiency and risk management. |
| Market Position | Following the transformational acquisition of Wintershall Dea in 2024, the company became one of the world's largest and most geographically diverse independent oil and gas producers, with pro forma production of approximately 475-500 kboepd across 11 countries. Norway is now the largest producing region in the portfolio, noted for low operating costs and a stable fiscal regime. The company holds a significant operated position in Germany, being one of the largest oil and gas producers there with diversified production hubs. The company is positioned as a market leader or major player in its key markets, with a balanced production split of approximately 40% oil, 40% European natural gas, and 20% other gas. It has a leading European CCS portfolio, including material participation in major projects in the UK, Denmark, and Norway, establishing it as a leading player in the CCS sector. The company is positioned close to entry into the FTSE 100 index by market capitalization, competing globally for top talent and benchmarking against FTSE 30-100 and international oil and gas peers. It maintains investment grade credit ratings, supporting financial strength and competitive shareholder returns. Specific market share percentages are not disclosed, but the company is described as one of the largest independent producers globally with significant scale and geographic diversity. | The company is positioned as a significant player in the upstream oil and gas sector with operations in key regions including the North Sea and international markets such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Mexico. While specific market share percentages are not provided, the company reported production of 186 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboepd) in 2023, with 2P reserves plus 2C resources totaling 880 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) at year-end 2023. The company is actively pursuing growth through mergers and acquisitions, exemplified by the $11.2 billion acquisition of Wintershall Dea's upstream oil and gas portfolio, described as the largest upstream deal outside North America in 2023. This acquisition and the company's strategic focus on diversification and full cycle capability suggest a market leader or strong challenger position in its key markets. The company also benefits from long-term relationships with joint venture partners, suppliers, and customers, and has formed strategic supply chain partnerships to improve efficiency and reduce risk. The upstream oil and gas M&A market in 2023 was highly active, with the company participating in this consolidation trend to maintain and enhance its competitive position. |


# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The company faces market risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, and foreign currency risk affecting financial instruments such as loans, borrowings, deposits, and derivatives. Commodity prices are volatile due to global and regional supply and demand factors, geopolitical conflicts, economic uncertainty, and political instability. The company manages commodity price exposure through a disciplined hedging programme using fixed price contracts and derivatives, targeting hedging of 40-70% of next 12 months' production and lower percentages for subsequent years. Foreign currency risk arises mainly from exchange rate movements of the US dollar against other currencies; the company mitigates this by matching financial assets and liabilities to functional currencies and using forward contracts. Interest rate risk relates primarily to floating rate borrowings; the company uses interest rate derivatives to manage exposure. The company also faces risks from changing customer demand due to climate change and energy transition, with potential impacts on oil and gas prices and investor focus on ESG factors. The company monitors market developments, reviews strategy regularly, and conducts scenario analyses to assess resilience. The Wintershall Dea transaction has diversified the portfolio and increased exposure to regional natural gas markets with fixed and formula prices. | The company faces market risks primarily related to fluctuations in commodity prices (oil and gas), interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the US dollar against the pound sterling. These risks impact the fair value of financial instruments and future cash flows. Market conditions such as economic downturns, regional conflicts, political instability, and the energy transition may cause prolonged price volatility and affect access to capital. The company actively manages commodity price exposure through a Board-approved hedging program covering 40-70% of next 12 months' production and uses fixed price contracts and derivatives. Foreign currency risk is mitigated by holding financial assets and liabilities in matching functional currencies and using forward contracts. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring exposure and using interest rate derivatives, though the Group currently has no floating rate borrowings. The company also monitors emerging market risks including evolving stakeholder expectations related to climate change and energy transition. Risk mitigation includes strong governance, regular Board reviews, and hedging strategies. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include failure to maintain safe, reliable, and cost-effective production operations, with uncertainties in forecasting production and operating costs, aging asset base requiring maintenance, and limited opportunities to increase production. The company relies on third parties such as joint venture partners and suppliers, which may not align with company values or provide timely and cost-effective services, potentially impacting access to transportation and market value realization. Risks also arise from complex drilling and capital projects that may face delays, cost overruns, quality issues, and HSES (health, safety, environment, and security) incidents. Cyber and information security risks have increased due to expanded scale and sophisticated threats, including AI-related risks. The company manages operational risks through rigorous cost control, asset integrity programs, operational performance metrics, proactive oversight of non-operated assets, emergency preparedness and crisis management systems, and cyber security programs. Integration risks from acquisitions are managed via governance frameworks and experienced leadership. Climate-related physical risks such as heat stress and extreme weather events are addressed through infrastructure resilience, contingency planning, and workforce protection measures. | Operational risks include failure to deliver competitive operational performance due to aging assets requiring substantial maintenance, potential outages, limited opportunities to increase production, and challenges in forecasting production and operating costs. There is risk related to supply chain, joint venture (JV) and downstream partners, and third-party infrastructure owners, including potential misalignment with partners, financial stress among partners, and contractor capacity impacted by inflation and geopolitical risks. Health, safety, environmental and physical security incidents pose major risks with potential for injury, property damage, environmental harm, and reputational damage. Cyber and information security risks have increased due to evolving threats and non-malicious data sharing via third parties including AI. The company manages these risks through a strong safety culture, rigorous operational performance monitoring, cost control, risk-based oversight of non-operated assets, supplier and partner assessments, emergency preparedness and crisis management systems, cyber security controls, and regular training and audits. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks encompass market risks (commodity price, interest rate, foreign currency), liquidity risk, credit risk, and financial discipline risks. The company manages commodity price risk through a Board-approved hedging programme with defined limits and strong controls.
