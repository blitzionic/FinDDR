Operating expenses increased steadily from €14,484m in 2022 to €15,244m in 2023 (+5.23%) and €16,191m in 2024 (+6.27%), outpacing revenue growth and contributing to margin compression. The relationship between operating income and revenue shows a weakening trend, suggesting challenges in cost management and operational leverage. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from 20.01% in 2022 to 23.55% in 2023 and further to 28.19% in 2024, which negatively impacted net profitability. Income tax expense rose from €2,068m in 2022 to €2,199m in 2023 (+6.34%) and €2,500m in 2024 (+13.69%), despite fluctuating net profits.

Operating income decreased to EUR 9,758 million from EUR 10,755 million, with operating margin falling from 17.90% to 16.37%, signaling increased operating expenses or cost pressures. Net profit declined to EUR 7,140 million from EUR 8,269 million, with net profit margin contracting from 13.76% to 11.98%, reflecting lower bottom-line profitability. Return on equity was 38.47% and return on assets 9.33% in 2023, indicating strong returns despite the profit decline. The effective tax rate increased to 23.55% from 20.01%, which contributed to lower net earnings. Overall, profitability weakened in 2023 with margin compressions and lower net income, though returns remain robust. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased from EUR 15,244 million to EUR 16,191 million, which contributed to a lower operating margin despite higher gross profit.

Interest expense increased from EUR 1,038 million to EUR 1,113 million, and interest coverage ratio declined from 940.08% to 844.56%, indicating a slight weakening in the ability to cover interest costs, though coverage remains very strong. The current ratio remained stable at about 76%, suggesting consistent liquidity. The increase in the effective tax rate from 23.55% to 28.19% could pose a risk to net profitability. Overall, financial risk remains manageable but with early warning signs from increased interest expense and tax burden. | Leverage increased slightly in 2023, with the debt to equity ratio rising to 301.08% from 295.04%, indicating a higher reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Interest expense increased to EUR 1,038 million from EUR 818 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased from 1,314.79% to 940.08%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest expenses from operating income. The effective tax rate rose to 23.55% from 20.01%, which may impact net profitability. Current ratio improved slightly to 76.16%, indicating stable short-term liquidity. The combination of higher leverage, increased interest expense, and lower interest coverage suggests elevated financial risk, warranting monitoring of debt servicing capacity and cost pressures. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities appear to be more conservative in 2024, with net cash from investing improving from a negative EUR 2,294 million in 2023 to a smaller outflow of EUR 625 million, indicating reduced capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing remained negative but slightly improved from EUR (7,193) million to EUR (6,941) million, with dividends paid stable around EUR (4,319) million, suggesting a consistent dividend policy. Revenue growth in key segments such as Beauty & Wellbeing and Ice Cream showed positive trends, with increases from EUR 12,466 million to EUR 13,157 million and EUR 7,924 million to EUR 8,282 million respectively. Geographic revenue trends show growth in The Americas and Europe, while Asia Pacific Africa saw a slight decline. These trends suggest potential growth opportunities in certain markets and product lines, supported by stable operational cash flow and a cautious investment approach, which bodes well for sustainable future financial performance. | Investment activities in 2023 showed a net cash outflow from investing of EUR (2,294) million compared to a net inflow of EUR 2,453 million in 2022, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions. Net cash from financing activities was an outflow of EUR (7,193) million, lower than EUR (8,890) million in 2022, reflecting continued debt repayments or dividend payments. Dividends paid increased slightly to EUR (4,363) million from EUR (4,329) million, suggesting a stable dividend policy. Revenue by product shows growth in Beauty & Wellbeing and Personal Care segments, while Foods and HomeCare declined slightly. Geographically, The Americas region revenue increased, while Asia Pacific Africa declined and Europe showed modest growth. The strong operational cash flow and targeted investments indicate potential for sustainable growth, though margin pressures and increased tax and interest costs may moderate near-term profitability. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Unilever faces market risks including commodity price risk, currency risk, and interest rate risk. Commodity price risk arises from fluctuations in raw material costs, managed through commodity derivatives and hedging strategies. Currency risk stems from exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations affecting sales, purchases, borrowings, and net investments in foreign operations; managed via derivatives, local currency borrowing, and net investment hedges.
