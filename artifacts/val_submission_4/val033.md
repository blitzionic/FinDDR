# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue shows a highly irregular trend with a sharp decline from 173,712 AUD in 2022 to 13,410 AUD in 2023, followed by a modest increase to 24,063 AUD in 2024. Due to the absence of Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit data for all years, gross margin performance cannot be assessed. Additionally, no data is available on revenue breakdown by product/service or geographic region, preventing analysis of revenue composition or regional shifts. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin and operating income data are unavailable for all years, limiting direct assessment of operating efficiency. However, the operating expense reported for 2023 is a significant negative value (-4,521,973 AUD), indicating very high costs relative to revenue that year. The net profit margins are deeply negative and deteriorate from (1,354.78%) in 2022 to (27,695.31%) in 2023, before improving somewhat to (10,737.91%) in 2024, reflecting extreme losses relative to revenue. This suggests poor cost management and operational inefficiency, with expenses vastly exceeding revenues. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remains consistently at approximately 0% (slightly negative but effectively zero) across all years, indicating no tax burden or tax benefits impacting profitability. There is no explicit data on non-recurring items or unusual patterns, nor any external factors provided that could explain the extreme losses or revenue volatility. The persistent and large net losses suggest underlying structural or market challenges rather than one-off events. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company demonstrated a significantly stronger financial position compared to 2023. Total assets increased substantially from 27,008,562 AUD to 35,540,560 AUD, driven by growth in both current assets (from 1,625,877 AUD to 6,003,092 AUD) and non-current assets (from 25,382,685 AUD to 29,537,468 AUD). Total liabilities decreased from 1,503,868 AUD to 1,028,090 AUD, reflecting improved liability management. Current liabilities dropped notably from 1,404,428 AUD to 866,286 AUD, while non-current liabilities increased slightly from 99,440 AUD to 161,804 AUD. Shareholders' equity rose markedly from 25,504,693 AUD to 34,512,470 AUD, indicating a stronger equity base. The current ratio improved dramatically from 115.77% to 692.97%, signaling enhanced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 5.90% to 2.98%, showing reduced leverage and a more conservative capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet strength and liquidity position improved significantly in 2024. | In 2023, the company demonstrated an improved overall financial position compared to 2022. Total assets increased significantly from 22,818,366 AUD to 27,008,562 AUD, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets from 19,491,917 AUD to 25,382,685 AUD. Total liabilities decreased from 1,999,557 AUD to 1,503,868 AUD, reflecting effective liability management and a reduction in both current and non-current liabilities. Shareholders' equity strengthened markedly from 20,818,809 AUD to 25,504,693 AUD, indicating a solid equity base. However, current assets declined from 3,326,448 AUD to 1,625,877 AUD, leading to a decrease in the current ratio from 177.63% to 115.77%, which still suggests reasonable liquidity but a notable reduction in short-term asset coverage. The debt to equity ratio improved from 9.60% to 5.90%, indicating a more conservative capital structure with lower leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects asset growth, reduced liabilities, and stronger equity, supporting a healthier financial position in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue nearly doubled from 13,410 AUD in 2023 to 24,063 AUD in 2024, indicating strong top-line growth. However, profitability remains negative with net profit losses narrowing from (3,713,941) AUD in 2023 to (2,583,863) AUD in 2024, showing an improvement in net losses. Income before taxes followed the same trend. The net profit margin, while still negative, improved substantially from (27,695.31%) in 2023 to (10,737.91%) in 2024, reflecting better cost control or revenue quality despite the absence of gross profit and operating income data. Return on equity improved from (16.03%) to (8.61%), and return on assets improved from (14.91%) to (8.26%), indicating enhanced earnings quality and more efficient use of equity and assets, though profitability remains negative. No income tax expense was recorded in either year, consistent with losses. | Profitability in 2023 worsened compared to 2022. Revenue dropped sharply from 173,712 AUD in 2022 to 13,410 AUD in 2023, a significant decline indicating reduced sales or operational scale. Net profit remained negative and deteriorated further from a loss of 2,353,412 AUD in 2022 to a larger loss of 3,713,941 AUD in 2023. The net profit margin worsened dramatically from -1354.78% to -27695.31%, reflecting extremely poor earnings quality and unsustainable losses relative to revenue. Operating expenses were substantial at -4,521,973 AUD in 2023, though no comparable 2022 data is available. Return on equity and return on assets were negative at -16.03% and -14.91% respectively, indicating that the company destroyed shareholder value and failed to generate returns from its asset base. The effective tax rate remained effectively zero, consistent with losses. Overall, the company faced severe profitability challenges and earnings quality issues in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expense data for 2024 is unavailable, but 2023 showed a large operating expense of (4,521,973) AUD. Asset turnover improved from 0.05% in 2023 to 0.08% in 2024, indicating better utilization of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations remained negative but improved from (1,871,148) AUD in 2023 to (1,553,743) AUD in 2024, suggesting better operational cash flow management. Working capital improved significantly as current assets increased and current liabilities decreased, contributing to a much higher current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency shows signs of improvement, though the company still operates with negative operating cash flow. | Operational efficiency in 2023 appears weak. The asset turnover ratio was very low at 0.05%, indicating poor utilization of assets to generate revenue, consistent with the sharp revenue decline. Operating expenses were very high at -4,521,973 AUD, but no gross profit or cost of goods sold data is available to assess cost control fully. Net cash from operations was negative and worsened from -938,036 AUD in 2022 to -1,871,148 AUD in 2023, signaling cash flow difficulties from core business activities. Working capital decreased as current assets fell and current liabilities also declined but to a lesser extent, reflected in the reduced current ratio. These factors suggest operational inefficiencies, poor cost management, and cash flow challenges in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage decreased as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio falling from 5.90% to 2.98%, reducing financial risk. Liquidity improved markedly with the current ratio rising to 692.97%, indicating strong short-term solvency. Interest expense increased slightly from (6,666) AUD to (8,745) AUD, but interest coverage ratios are unavailable, limiting assessment of interest burden. The effective tax rate remained effectively zero due to losses. Despite improved liquidity and lower leverage, the company continues to report net losses and negative cash flow from operations, which pose ongoing financial risks. The increase in non-current liabilities from 99,440 AUD to 161,804 AUD is modest but should be monitored. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 show some improvement in leverage but ongoing liquidity and earnings risks. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 9.60% to 5.90%, indicating reduced financial leverage and potentially lower solvency risk. The current ratio declined from 177.63% to 115.77%, still above 1 but showing reduced short-term liquidity buffer. Interest expense slightly increased from -6,501 AUD to -6,666 AUD, but interest coverage ratios are unavailable, limiting assessment of interest payment capacity. The company reported no income tax expense due to losses, and the effective tax rate remained near zero. The large and increasing net losses, negative cash flow from operations, and declining liquidity ratios highlight ongoing financial risk and early warning signs of distress despite lower leverage. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities, as reflected by net cash from investing, show a reduced outflow from (7,168,021) AUD in 2023 to (5,011,552) AUD in 2024, indicating a moderation in capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing increased significantly from 7,180,732 AUD to 11,015,929 AUD, suggesting increased external funding to support growth or operations. The net increase in cash turned positive to 4,450,634 AUD in 2024 from a decrease in 2023, enhancing cash sustainability. No dividends were paid in either year, consistent with ongoing losses and reinvestment focus. Revenue growth and improved liquidity suggest potential for continued recovery, but sustained profitability and positive operating cash flow will be critical. No segment or geographic revenue data is available to assess market trends. | Future financial performance appears uncertain with mixed signals. The company invested heavily in 2023, as net cash from investing activities increased in outflow from -5,606,676 AUD in 2022 to -7,168,021 AUD in 2023, indicating significant capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Financing cash flow turned positive to 7,180,732 AUD from a negative -85,613 AUD in 2022, suggesting new capital injections or debt financing to support operations and investments. Despite these investments, net cash from operations remained negative and worsened, raising concerns about cash flow sustainability. No dividends were paid in either year, consistent with the loss-making position. Lack of detailed segment or geographic revenue data limits market trend analysis. Overall, while investment activity signals growth intent, ongoing operational losses and cash flow deficits pose challenges to future financial performance sustainability. |

The Group is currently at a stage with little or no exposure to commodity price risk. The Company operates in the mineral exploration sector in Australia and is subject to market conditions impacting exploration success and demand for mineral resources. The risk of exploration failure is inherent and acknowledged, with no certainty that exploration objectives will be achieved. The Group's ability to raise capital through equity markets is critical to its operations, and there is no guarantee that additional funding will be secured, which could impact future exploration programs and shareholder value. The Group monitors market risk exposures within acceptable parameters but does not use derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include inherent risks in exploration activities such as land disturbance, waste disposal, and environmental impacts that could cause delays, additional costs, or penalties. The Group is subject to significant environmental regulations and has procedures to minimize environmental impacts. There are risks related to business continuity and day-to-day operations, including reliance on key management personnel and the need to manage exploration programs effectively. The Group also faces risks related to impairment of exploration and evaluation assets if technical feasibility or commercial viability is not demonstrated. Supply chain or manufacturing risks are not specifically addressed. | Operational risks include the inherent risks of exploration failure, which the Board acknowledges cannot be fully mitigated or predicted. The Group's exploration activities involve environmental risks such as land disturbance and waste disposal, which could lead to delays, additional costs, or legislative penalties.

| Financial Risks | Financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk is limited as the Group invests only with major A+ rated Australian financial institutions and has low exposure on trade and other receivables. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash reserves from capital raisings and monitoring cash flows; the Group had sufficient cash reserves as of 30 June 2024 and completed a $25 million placement to fund operations through to Final Investment Decision (FID). Interest rate risk arises primarily from cash and interest-bearing liabilities, with no derivatives used for mitigation. The Group's capital management focuses on maintaining liquidity to meet exploration and corporate overheads, primarily through equity raisings, as it lacks ready access to credit facilities. The Group has no significant exposure to commodity price risk or foreign exchange risk. | Financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk is limited as the Group invests only with major Australian financial institutions rated A+ and has low exposure on trade and other receivables. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash reserves from capital raisings and monitoring cash flows to meet liabilities as they fall due. The Group had sufficient cash reserves at the reporting date but relies heavily on equity raisings for funding, including a $3 million placement and a $2 million Share Purchase Plan in 2023. The Group does not have credit standby facilities or other funding arrangements. Interest rate risk arises mainly from cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing liabilities; however, the Group does not use derivatives to mitigate this risk. Capital risk management focuses on maintaining liquidity to meet exploration and corporate overheads, with the ability to curtail discretionary spending if required. The Group's going concern depends on securing additional funding and managing cash flows prudently. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group faces economic challenges primarily related to liquidity and capital requirements. The Company relies heavily on equity raisings as its primary source of funding due to limited access to credit facilities, which introduces uncertainty regarding the availability of future capital. While the Group had sufficient cash reserves as of 30 June 2024 and secured firm commitments for a $25 million placement in September 2024, additional funding beyond current plans may be required to support expanded exploration activities, potentially diluting shareholdings or incurring restrictive debt financing. Market risks include exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices, although the Group currently has little exposure to commodity price risk. The Group also faces cost pressures and risks related to environmental compliance and rehabilitation provisions, which could increase operational costs. Economic uncertainties include the risk of exploration failure and the inherent unpredictability of mineral exploration outcomes, which may impact future revenue and profitability. The Group's ability to continue as a going concern depends on successfully raising capital and managing cash flows prudently amid these economic conditions. | The Group faces economic challenges primarily related to liquidity and capital raising risks. The ability to continue as a going concern depends on securing funds through equity markets and managing cash flows within available funds. The Group has limited access to credit facilities and relies mainly on equity raisings to fund exploration and corporate overheads. Cost pressures include administrative, discretionary exploration, and overhead cash outflows which may need to be curtailed if required. The Group's working capital is low ($221,449 as at 30 June 2023), and it has incurred significant losses ($3,713,941 loss for the year). There is uncertainty regarding the ability to obtain additional funding, which may dilute shareholdings or impose restrictions if debt financing is pursued. Market risks include exposure to commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices, although the Group currently has little or no exposure to commodity price risk. Economic uncertainties also arise from exploration failure risks and environmental regulations that could lead to additional costs or delays. The Group's exploration properties may be subject to native title claims or restrictions, adding to economic uncertainty. |
