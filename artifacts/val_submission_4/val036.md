# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue showed a steady growth from AUD 21,277m in 2022 to AUD 22,702m in 2023 (6.7% increase), and a more modest increase to AUD 22,928m in 2024 (1.0% increase). Gross profit increased from AUD 18,629m in 2022 to AUD 19,849m in 2023 and AUD 20,045m in 2024, maintaining a stable gross margin of approximately 87.43% in 2023 and 2024, slightly down from 87.55% in 2022, indicating consistent cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. By product/service, Mobile revenue grew significantly from AUD 9,470m in 2022 to AUD 10,258m in 2023 and further to AUD 10,722m in 2024, reflecting strong demand or market share gains. Fixed - C&SB and Fixed - Enterprise segments showed slight declines over the period, with Fixed - C&SB decreasing from AUD 4,486m in 2022 to AUD 4,355m in 2024, and Fixed - Enterprise from AUD 3,729m to AUD 3,537m. InfraCo Fixed and International revenues increased notably, with International revenue surging from AUD 1,501m in 2022 to AUD 2,578m in 2024, indicating successful geographic expansion or increased offshore sales. Other segments like Amplitel and Other also showed growth, while Fixed - Active Wholesale declined. Geographically, Australian customer revenue grew steadily from AUD 20,028m in 2022 to AUD 20,793m in 2024, while offshore customer revenue increased significantly from AUD 1,249m to AUD 2,135m, highlighting a strategic shift or growth focus on international markets. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income rose from AUD 2,898m in 2022 to AUD 3,392m in 2023 but declined to AUD 3,049m in 2024 despite revenue growth, resulting in operating margins of 13.62% in 2022, peaking at 14.94% in 2023, then falling to 13.30% in 2024. This suggests a deterioration in operating efficiency in 2024. Operating expenses increased steadily from AUD 14,758m in 2022 to AUD 15,356m in 2023 and AUD 15,938m in 2024, outpacing revenue growth in 2024 and contributing to margin compression. The relationship between operating income and revenue indicates that while the company managed to improve operating profitability in 2023, cost management challenges emerged in 2024, reducing operating margin despite stable gross margins. This points to increased operating expenses or less effective cost control at the operating level in the latest year. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 26.88% in 2022 to 28.36% in 2023 before slightly decreasing to 27.46% in 2024. This fluctuation impacted net profit margins, which declined from 8.53% in 2022 to 8.49% in 2023 and further to 7.07% in 2024. Income tax expense rose from AUD 667m in 2022 to AUD 812m in 2023, then decreased to AUD 677m in 2024, reflecting the tax rate changes and profit before tax variations. There is no explicit mention of non-recurring items or unusual patterns in the data provided. External factors influencing profitability appear to include increased offshore revenue, which may have different tax implications, and rising operating expenses that could be linked to market conditions or strategic investments. Overall, tax rate changes and operating cost pressures have negatively affected net profitability in 2024. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a modest increase in total assets to AUD 45,550 million from AUD 45,029 million in 2023, driven primarily by growth in non-current assets (AUD 39,443 million vs. AUD 38,296 million). However, current assets declined to AUD 6,107 million from AUD 6,733 million, indicating a reduction in short-term liquidity resources. Total liabilities increased to AUD 28,198 million from AUD 27,213 million, with current liabilities rising notably to AUD 11,526 million from AUD 10,092 million, while non-current liabilities decreased slightly. Shareholders' equity decreased to AUD 17,352 million from AUD 17,816 million, reflecting retained earnings decline. The current ratio dropped from 66.72% to 52.98%, signaling reduced liquidity. The debt to equity ratio increased to 162.51% from 152.74%, indicating higher leverage and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet shows asset growth but with increased liabilities and reduced equity, suggesting a moderate weakening in financial position and liquidity in 2024 compared to 2023. | In 2023, the company demonstrated a solid financial position with total assets increasing from AUD 41,628 million in 2022 to AUD 45,029 million, reflecting asset growth of approximately 8.2%. Both current assets and non-current assets grew, with current assets rising from AUD 6,260 million to AUD 6,733 million and non-current assets from AUD 35,368 million to AUD 38,296 million. Total liabilities also increased from AUD 24,652 million to AUD 27,213 million, driven by rises in both current liabilities (from AUD 9,698 million to AUD 10,092 million) and non-current liabilities (from AUD 14,954 million to AUD 17,121 million). Shareholders' equity improved moderately from AUD 16,976 million to AUD 17,816 million, supported by a slight increase in retained earnings. The current ratio improved from 64.55% to 66.72%, indicating a marginally better liquidity position. However, the debt to equity ratio increased from 145.22% to 152.74%, suggesting a higher leverage level and a more aggressive capital structure. Overall, the balance sheet reflects growth in assets and equity but with increased liabilities, maintaining a leveraged but stable financial structure. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Revenue increased slightly by 0.99% to AUD 22,928 million in 2024 from AUD 22,702 million in 2023. Gross profit rose marginally to AUD 20,045 million, maintaining a stable gross margin of 87.43%. However, operating income declined by 10.1% to AUD 3,049 million, with operating margin decreasing from 14.94% to 13.30%. Net profit fell by 15.9% to AUD 1,622 million, reducing net profit margin from 8.49% to 7.07%. Return on equity dropped from 11.08% to 9.22%, and return on assets declined from 4.45% to 3.58%, indicating lower profitability and earnings quality. The effective tax rate slightly decreased to 27.46% from 28.36%, providing minor tax relief. Overall, while revenue and gross profit remained stable, profitability margins and returns weakened in 2024, suggesting pressure on earnings quality and sustainability. | Revenue increased by 6.7% from AUD 21,277 million in 2022 to AUD 22,702 million in 2023, indicating positive top-line growth. Gross profit rose from AUD 18,629 million to AUD 19,849 million, though the gross margin slightly decreased from 87.55% to 87.43%, showing stable cost of goods sold control relative to revenue. Operating income improved by 17% from AUD 2,898 million to AUD 3,392 million, with operating margin increasing from 13.62% to 14.94%, reflecting enhanced operational profitability. Net profit increased modestly from AUD 1,814 million to AUD 1,928 million, but net profit margin slightly declined from 8.53% to 8.49%, indicating some pressure on bottom-line efficiency possibly due to higher expenses or taxes. Return on equity was 11.08% and return on assets was 4.45% in 2023, with no prior year data for comparison, suggesting reasonable earnings quality and asset utilization. The effective tax rate increased from 26.88% to 28.36%, which may have slightly dampened net profitability. Overall, the company showed improved revenue and operating profitability with stable margins, though net margin and tax expenses warrant monitoring. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses increased by 3.8% to AUD 15,938 million, outpacing the modest revenue growth, which contributed to the decline in operating income and margin. Asset turnover decreased to 50.63% from 52.40%, indicating less efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations improved to AUD 7,049 million from AUD 6,802 million, reflecting strong cash generation despite lower profitability. Inventories decreased slightly to AUD 518 million from AUD 546 million, suggesting tighter inventory management. The decline in current assets and increase in current liabilities, along with a lower current ratio, may indicate some working capital pressure. Overall, operational efficiency shows mixed signals: cost control challenges and reduced asset utilization, but improved operating cash flow. | Operating expenses increased from AUD 14,758 million in 2022 to AUD 15,356 million in 2023, a 4% rise, which is lower than the revenue growth rate, contributing to improved operating margin. The asset turnover ratio in 2023 was 52.40%, indicating efficient use of assets to generate revenue, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations decreased from AUD 7,249 million to AUD 6,802 million, a decline of about 6.1%, which may reflect changes in working capital or operational cash flow quality. Inventories increased from AUD 476 million to AUD 546 million, a 14.7% rise, which could impact working capital management. The current ratio improved slightly, supporting liquidity. Overall, the company maintained good cost control relative to revenue growth, demonstrated efficient asset utilization, but experienced a slight decline in operational cash flow, suggesting a need to monitor working capital and cash conversion cycles. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Leverage increased as evidenced by the rise in debt to equity ratio to 162.51% from 152.74%, indicating higher financial risk. Interest expense increased to AUD 696 million from AUD 630 million, while interest coverage ratio declined significantly to 438.07% from 538.41%, reflecting reduced ability to cover interest costs comfortably. The current ratio fell to 52.98% from 66.72%, signaling potential liquidity risk. The effective tax rate decreased slightly, which may marginally improve net income but does not offset other risks. The combination of higher leverage, increased interest expense, and reduced liquidity suggests elevated financial risk and early warning signs for potential stress in meeting short-term and debt obligations. | Leverage increased in 2023 as evidenced by the debt to equity ratio rising from 145.22% to 152.74%, indicating higher reliance on debt financing. Interest expense increased from AUD 527 million to AUD 630 million, a 19.5% rise, which may pressure earnings. Despite this, interest coverage remained strong at 538.41%, only slightly lower than 549.91% in 2022, suggesting the company can comfortably meet interest obligations. The effective tax rate increased from 26.88% to 28.36%, which could impact net profitability. Current liabilities increased moderately, but the current ratio improved, indicating manageable short-term liquidity risk. No data on financing cash flows for 2022 limits full risk assessment, but 2023 financing cash flow was negative at AUD (969) million, possibly reflecting debt repayments or dividend payments. Overall, while leverage and interest expenses increased, coverage ratios remain robust, but the company should monitor rising debt levels and tax impacts as potential risk factors. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities show a reduction in net cash used for investing to AUD (4,990) million from AUD (5,951) million, indicating a moderation in capital expenditures or asset purchases. Net cash from financing activities outflow increased to AUD (1,942) million from AUD (969) million, with dividends paid rising slightly to AUD (2,022) million from AUD (1,964) million, suggesting a continued commitment to shareholder returns despite lower earnings. Revenue growth in key segments such as Mobile and International increased, while Fixed - C&SB and Fixed - Enterprise segments declined, indicating shifting market dynamics. Geographic revenue from Australian customers grew slightly, as did offshore revenue, supporting moderate growth prospects. The positive net increase in cash of AUD 117 million versus a decrease in 2023 suggests improved cash flow sustainability. Overall, the company appears to be cautiously investing and maintaining dividends, with moderate growth in key markets, but profitability pressures and higher leverage may constrain future financial performance. | Investment activities intensified in 2023, with net cash used in investing activities increasing significantly from AUD (3,395) million to AUD (5,951) million, indicating substantial capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Dividends paid increased slightly from AUD (1,888) million to AUD (1,964) million, reflecting a stable or slightly more generous dividend policy, supported by retained earnings growth. Revenue growth was driven notably by offshore customers, whose revenue increased from AUD 1,249 million to AUD 2,074 million, a 66% increase, suggesting expanding international market presence. Mobile and InfraCo Fixed segments also showed revenue growth, while some fixed segments declined slightly, indicating shifting product/service dynamics. The slight increase in current ratio and stable operating margins support ongoing operational sustainability. However, the decline in net cash from operations and increased investing outflows highlight the need for careful cash flow management. Overall, the company appears positioned for growth through investment and international expansion, with a commitment to shareholder returns, but must balance cash flow sustainability. |
