# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | From 2022 to 2023, revenue increased from $113,765K to $132,645K, a growth of approximately 16.6%. However, from 2023 to 2024, revenue declined by about 9.3% to $120,266K. Gross margin improved steadily over the three years, rising from 71.93% in 2022 to 69.66% in 2023, then significantly to 78.68% in 2024, indicating better cost control or higher-margin sales mix despite the revenue drop in 2024. Subscription revenue, the largest product segment, grew from $100,522K in 2022 to $119,082K in 2023 (+18.4%) but then declined to $111,073K in 2024 (-6.7%). Advisory revenue showed a slight decline from 2023 ($5,455K) to 2024 ($4,640K), while advertising revenue decreased steadily from $2,703K in 2022 to $1,683K in 2024. Books revenue dropped sharply in 2024 to $233K from $1,166K in 2023. Other revenue also declined from $5,310K in 2023 to $2,637K in 2024. Geographically, North America remains the dominant market, though revenue decreased from $107,108K in 2023 to $95,503K in 2024 (-10.8%). Europe showed strong growth, nearly doubling from $10,072K in 2022 to $21,792K in 2024 (+116.4%). Australia and Asia revenues were relatively stable, with Asia declining from $4,595K in 2023 to $1,695K in 2024. Overall, the company experienced revenue growth in 2023 but a contraction in 2024, with improved gross margins driven by cost of goods sold reduction and a shift in product and geographic revenue mix favoring higher-margin segments and regions. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating margin improved from a deeply negative (77.52%) in 2022 to (73.68%) in 2023 and further to (26.56%) in 2024, indicating a significant reduction in operating losses relative to revenue. Operating income, while still negative, improved from a loss of $88,189K in 2022 to a loss of $31,941K in 2024, reflecting better operational control. Operating expenses decreased substantially from $201,954K in 2022 to $126,568K in 2024 (-37.3%), demonstrating effective cost management. The reduction in operating expenses outpaced the decline in revenue from 2023 to 2024, contributing to the improved operating margin. Despite the negative operating income, the narrowing loss trend suggests the company is moving towards operational efficiency and better scalability of its cost structure relative to revenue. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate shifted from a positive 1.47% in 2022 to a negative (0.19%) in 2023, then rose sharply to 5.33% in 2024. The negative tax rate in 2023 likely reflects tax benefits or credits associated with the large net loss of $115,461K that year. In 2024, the positive tax expense of $536K despite a positive net profit of $9,517K indicates normalized tax obligations. The net profit margin swung dramatically from a negative (191.85%) in 2022 and (87.05%) in 2023 to a positive 7.91% in 2024, suggesting that non-recurring losses or write-downs heavily impacted prior years. The large operating losses and net losses in 2022 and 2023 imply possible one-off impairments or restructuring costs, while 2024 shows recovery. External factors such as market contraction in North America and Asia and shifts in product demand likely influenced profitability, but the improved tax position and reduced operating losses in 2024 indicate a return to more sustainable profitability. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | In 2024, the company shows a stronger financial position compared to 2023. Total assets decreased from 370,561 to 326,197 thousand USD, driven by a reduction in non-current assets from 320,756 to 269,010 thousand USD, while current assets increased from 49,805 to 57,187 thousand USD, indicating improved liquidity. Total liabilities significantly declined from 327,102 to 228,366 thousand USD, with both current liabilities dropping from 65,650 to 51,253 thousand USD and non-current liabilities from 261,452 to 177,113 thousand USD, reflecting effective liability management. Shareholders' equity more than doubled from 43,459 to 97,831 thousand USD, strengthening the equity base despite retained earnings remaining deeply negative but slightly improved from (816,416) to (806,899) thousand USD. The current ratio improved markedly from 75.86% to 111.58%, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. The debt to equity ratio improved substantially from 752.67% to 233.43%, showing a more balanced capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, the balance sheet reflects a healthier financial position with better liquidity, lower leverage, and a stronger equity cushion in 2024. | In 2023, the company experienced a decline in total assets from $433,157K in 2022 to $370,561K, indicating a contraction in asset base primarily driven by a reduction in current assets from $86,005K to $49,805K and a moderate decrease in non-current assets from $347,152K to $320,756K. Total liabilities increased significantly from $288,467K to $327,102K, with both current liabilities rising slightly from $62,112K to $65,650K and non-current liabilities increasing from $226,355K to $261,452K. This liability growth outpaced asset growth, resulting in a sharp decline in shareholders' equity from $144,690K to $43,459K. The equity position weakened substantially, reflecting increased financial leverage and reduced net worth. Liquidity deteriorated as the current ratio dropped from 138.47% to 75.86%, signaling potential short-term liquidity stress. The capital structure shifted towards higher leverage, with the debt to equity ratio escalating dramatically from 199.37% to 752.67%, indicating a much heavier reliance on debt financing relative to equity in 2023. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | The company’s profitability improved significantly in 2024. Revenue decreased by 9.3% from 132,645 to 120,266 thousand USD, yet gross profit increased from 92,394 to 94,627 thousand USD due to a substantial reduction in cost of goods sold from 40,251 to 25,639 thousand USD, resulting in an improved gross margin rising from 69.66% to 78.68%. Operating expenses decreased sharply from 190,133 to 126,568 thousand USD, reducing the operating loss from (97,739) to (31,941) thousand USD and improving the operating margin from (73.68%) to (26.56%). Net profit turned positive at 9,517 thousand USD compared to a net loss of (115,461) thousand USD in 2023, lifting the net profit margin from (87.05%) to 7.91%. Return on equity improved from a negative (122.73%) to a positive 13.47%, and return on assets improved from (28.73%) to 2.73%, indicating earnings sustainability and improved profitability quality. The effective tax rate increased from a negative (0.19%) to 5.33%, consistent with positive pre-tax income. Overall, 2024 reflects a turnaround in earnings quality and profitability despite lower revenue. | Revenue improved notably by 16.6%, rising from $113,765K in 2022 to $132,645K in 2023, driven by growth in subscription revenue ($100,522K to $119,082K) and European geographic sales ($10,072K to $19,749K). Despite higher revenue, gross margin declined slightly from 71.93% to 69.66%, reflecting increased cost of goods sold from $31,937K to $40,251K. Operating expenses decreased from $201,954K to $190,133K, yet operating income worsened from a loss of $88,189K to a larger loss of $97,739K, indicating that cost reductions were insufficient to offset increased COGS and other factors. Net profit loss improved significantly, narrowing from $(218,257)K to $(115,461)K, and net profit margin improved from (191.85%) to (87.05%). Return on equity and return on assets were negative at (122.73%) and (28.73%) respectively, reflecting ongoing unprofitability and erosion of shareholder value. Earnings quality remains weak due to sustained losses, though the reduction in net loss suggests some improvement in earnings sustainability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024. The operating margin loss narrowed significantly from (73.68%) to (26.56%), reflecting better cost control and expense management. Asset turnover slightly increased from 33.01% to 34.52%, indicating marginally better utilization of assets to generate revenue. However, net cash from operations remained negative at (5,298) thousand USD, though this is a substantial improvement from the (35,494) thousand USD negative cash flow in 2023, suggesting progress toward operational cash flow sustainability. Working capital improved as current assets increased and current liabilities decreased, contributing to a higher current ratio of 111.58%. Despite ongoing negative operating cash flow, the trend is positive, and cost control measures appear effective in improving operational efficiency. | Operating margin improved slightly from (77.52%) in 2022 to (73.68%) in 2023, indicating marginally better cost control relative to revenue. Asset turnover was high at 33.01, suggesting efficient use of assets to generate revenue despite the asset base contraction. However, net cash from operations remained negative at $(35,494)K, though improved from $(72,625)K in 2022, indicating ongoing operational cash flow challenges. Working capital weakened as current assets decreased and current liabilities increased, consistent with the lower current ratio. Overall, operational efficiency shows some improvement in margin and cash flow trends but remains under pressure due to negative operating income and cash flow deficits. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators show improvement but some risks remain. Leverage decreased significantly as debt to equity ratio improved from 752.67% to 233.43%, reducing financial risk. Liquidity improved with the current ratio rising from 75.86% to 111.58%, indicating better ability to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense decreased from 29,940 to 23,589 thousand USD, easing interest burden. However, interest coverage remains negative at (135.41%) despite improvement from (326.45%) in 2023, indicating the company still struggles to cover interest expenses from operating income. The effective tax rate increased to 5.33%, reflecting positive earnings but also a higher tax burden. Overall, while leverage and liquidity risks have diminished, the company still faces challenges in interest coverage and cash flow generation, warranting close monitoring. | Financial risk increased in 2023 as leverage intensified, with debt to equity ratio surging to 752.67% from 199.37%, reflecting a substantial increase in liabilities relative to equity. Liquidity risk is elevated given the current ratio fell below 1 to 75.86%, indicating potential difficulty meeting short-term obligations. Interest expense decreased significantly from $95,741K to $29,940K, improving interest coverage ratio from (92.11%) to (326.45%), which suggests better ability to cover interest costs despite losses. The effective tax rate turned negative to (0.19%) from 1.47%, likely due to tax benefits from losses. Overall, the company faces heightened financial risk from leverage and liquidity constraints, though interest coverage improvement is a positive sign. |
| Future financial performance projection | Investment activities in 2024 show a positive net cash inflow from investing activities of 89,168 thousand USD compared to an outflow of (20,317) thousand USD in 2023, suggesting asset disposals or reduced capital expenditures that may support liquidity. Net cash from financing activities was negative at (71,432) thousand USD, a reversal from positive 12,077 thousand USD in 2023, indicating debt repayments or reduced financing inflows. The net increase in cash was positive at 12,154 thousand USD, improving cash reserves. No dividends were paid in either year, consistent with a focus on financial stabilization. Revenue by geographic region shows a decline in North America revenue from 107,108 to 95,503 thousand USD but growth in Europe from 19,749 to 21,792 thousand USD, indicating potential geographic market shifts. Subscription revenue remains the largest segment but declined from 119,082 to 111,073 thousand USD, while other revenue streams showed mixed trends. Overall, the company appears to be focusing on deleveraging and liquidity improvement with cautious investment and financing strategies, positioning for more stable future performance with geographic diversification opportunities. | Investment activities intensified as net cash used in investing doubled from $(10,242)K in 2022 to $(20,317)K in 2023, indicating increased capital expenditures or acquisitions aimed at growth. Financing cash inflows dropped sharply from $111,530K to $12,077K, suggesting reduced external financing availability or repayment of debt. The net decrease in cash of $(43,923)K in 2023 contrasts with a net increase in 2022, raising concerns about cash flow sustainability. No dividends were paid in either year, consistent with the company's loss position. Revenue growth in subscription and European markets signals potential growth areas, but ongoing losses and cash flow deficits imply that financial performance recovery depends on continued operational improvements and effective capital management. |
