The current ratio improved from 351.56% to 417.13%, indicating enhanced liquidity and a robust ability to cover short-term obligations. The debt to equity ratio decreased substantially from 86.34% to 52.93%, signaling a more conservative capital structure with reduced leverage. Overall, NVIDIA's financial health in 2024 is characterized by strong asset growth, improved liquidity, and a solid equity base supporting sustainable operations. | In 2023, NVIDIA's total assets decreased to $41,182 million from $44,187 million in 2022, reflecting a contraction in overall asset base. Current assets declined significantly from $28,829 million to $23,073 million, while non-current assets increased from $15,358 million to $18,109 million, indicating a shift towards longer-term investments or capital assets. Total liabilities rose from $17,575 million to $19,081 million, driven primarily by an increase in current liabilities from $4,335 million to $6,563 million, despite a slight decrease in non-current liabilities from $13,240 million to $12,518 million. Shareholders' equity contracted from $26,612 million to $22,101 million, with retained earnings dropping notably from $16,235 million to $10,171 million, signaling reduced accumulated profits. The current ratio decreased substantially from 665.03% to 351.56%, indicating a decline in short-term liquidity but still a strong liquidity position. The debt to equity ratio increased from 66.04% to 86.34%, suggesting a higher leverage and greater reliance on debt financing relative to equity. Overall, NVIDIA's financial health in 2023 shows a modestly reduced asset base, increased leverage, and lower equity, with liquidity remaining strong but diminished compared to the prior year. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | NVIDIA's profitability in 2024 showed exceptional improvement over 2023. Revenue more than doubled from $26,974 million to $60,922 million, driven primarily by a substantial increase in Compute & Networking revenue (from $15,068 million to $47,405 million) while Graphics revenue grew modestly (from $11,906 million to $13,517 million).

Net profit rose from $4,368 million to $29,760 million, pushing net profit margin from 16.19% to 48.85%. Return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) also improved substantially, with ROE climbing from 17.93% to 91.46% and ROA from 10.23% to 55.67%, indicating high earnings quality and efficient use of equity and assets. The effective tax rate shifted from a negative (4.47%) to a positive 12.00%, reflecting normalized tax expense. Overall, NVIDIA's 2024 profitability and earnings quality reflect outstanding operational leverage and strong bottom-line growth. | NVIDIA's revenue in 2023 was essentially flat at $26,974 million compared to $26,914 million in 2022, showing no significant top-line growth. However, cost of goods sold increased sharply from $9,439 million to $11,618 million, causing gross profit to decline from $17,475 million to $15,356 million. This resulted in a gross margin contraction from 64.93% to 56.93%. Operating expenses rose markedly from $7,434 million to $11,132 million, leading to a steep drop in operating income from $10,041 million to $4,224 million and a corresponding operating margin decline from 37.31% to 15.66%. Net profit fell by more than half, from $9,752 million to $4,368 million, with net profit margin decreasing from 36.23% to 16.19%. Income tax expense turned negative to $(187) million from $189 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of -4.47% compared to 1.90% previously, which may reflect tax credits or adjustments improving net income. Return on equity and return on assets for 2023 were 17.93% and 10.23%, respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to equity and assets despite the profit decline. Overall, profitability and earnings quality weakened significantly in 2023 due to rising costs and expenses, compressing margins and net income despite stable revenue. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency in 2024 improved significantly. Cost of goods sold increased from $11,618 million to $16,621 million, but at a much slower pace than revenue, contributing to a higher gross margin. Operating expenses remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $11,132 million to $11,329 million despite the large revenue growth, indicating effective cost control. Asset turnover improved from 63.19% to 113.97%, showing more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. Net cash from operations surged from $5,641 million to $28,090 million, reflecting strong cash generation capacity. Inventories increased marginally from $5,159 million to $5,282 million, suggesting stable inventory management relative to sales growth. Working capital improved as current assets grew faster than current liabilities, supporting operational liquidity. Overall, NVIDIA demonstrated excellent operational efficiency with strong cash flow generation and disciplined expense management in 2024. | Operational efficiency in 2023 shows challenges for NVIDIA. Cost control weakened as cost of goods sold and operating expenses increased substantially, outpacing flat revenue growth. Asset turnover was reported at 63.19%, indicating relatively high revenue generation per unit of assets, though no prior year comparison is available. Net cash from operations declined from $9,108 million in 2022 to $5,641 million in 2023, reflecting reduced cash generation from core business activities. Working capital dynamics show current assets decreased while current liabilities increased, which may pressure short-term operational liquidity. Inventories nearly doubled from $2,605 million to $5,159 million, potentially signaling slower inventory turnover or buildup of stock. Net cash from investing activities decreased from $9,830 million to $7,375 million, indicating lower investment outflows or asset sales. Net cash from financing surged from $1,865 million to $11,617 million, suggesting significant financing activity, possibly debt issuance or equity transactions. Dividends paid remained stable around $398 million. Overall, operational efficiency was impaired by rising costs and inventory accumulation, with reduced operational cash flow and increased financing activity. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators for 2024 suggest a reduced risk profile compared to 2023. The debt to equity ratio decreased from 86.34% to 52.93%, indicating lower leverage and reduced financial risk. The current ratio improved from 351.56% to 417.13%, reflecting strong liquidity and a comfortable buffer to meet short-term obligations. Interest expense remained stable and low at approximately $257 million, with interest coverage ratio increasing dramatically from 1612.21% to 12,829.57%, indicating an extremely strong ability to cover interest payments from operating income. The effective tax rate increased to 12.00% from a negative rate, which may reflect normalization of tax obligations but does not indicate increased risk. No significant increases in non-current liabilities were observed. Overall, NVIDIA's financial risk in 2024 appears low with strong liquidity, reduced leverage, and excellent interest coverage. | Financial risk indicators in 2023 point to increased leverage and liquidity risk for NVIDIA. The debt to equity ratio rose from 66.04% to 86.34%, indicating higher financial leverage and greater reliance on debt financing. The current ratio declined from 665.03% to 351.56%, signaling a reduction in short-term liquidity buffer, though still strong. Interest expense increased slightly from $236 million to $262 million, while interest coverage ratio decreased significantly from 4254.66% to 1612.21%, reflecting lower operating income relative to interest costs but still a very comfortable coverage level. The effective tax rate turned negative to -4.47% from 1.90%, which may indicate tax benefits or credits but also introduces some variability in tax expense. The substantial increase in inventories and current liabilities could pose operational liquidity risks if not managed properly. No other explicit risk metrics are provided. Overall, while NVIDIA maintains strong interest coverage and liquidity, the increased leverage and inventory buildup warrant monitoring for potential financial risk escalation. |
| Future financial performance projection | NVIDIA's future financial performance outlook appears robust based on 2024 data. Net cash from investing activities increased from $7,375 million to $10,566 million, indicating continued investment in growth and capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities also rose from $11,617 million to $13,633 million, suggesting active capital management possibly including debt issuance or equity transactions. The company maintained a stable dividend payout around $395 million, indicating a consistent dividend policy. Revenue growth was driven predominantly by the Compute & Networking segment, which grew over threefold, signaling a strategic focus area likely to sustain future growth. Geographic revenue distribution shifted with increased U.S. revenue share (from 31% to 44%), which may reflect market expansion or concentration. Strong cash flow from operations ($28,090 million) supports sustainability of investments and dividends. Overall, NVIDIA is well-positioned for continued growth with strong investment activity, cash flow sustainability, and strategic segment focus in 2024. | NVIDIA's future financial performance in 2023 shows mixed signals. The company increased investment in non-current assets from $15,358 million to $18,109 million, indicating ongoing capital expenditure or strategic asset acquisition. Net cash from investing activities decreased but remained significant at $7,375 million, suggesting continued investment activity. The large increase in net cash from financing activities from $1,865 million to $11,617 million may reflect new debt or equity financing to support growth or liquidity needs. Dividends remained stable at approximately $398 million, indicating a consistent dividend policy. Revenue by product shows a shift with Compute & Networking revenue increasing from $11,046 million to $15,068 million, while Graphics revenue declined from $15,868 million to $11,906 million, signaling a strategic pivot or changing market demand. Geographically, revenue from the United States grew substantially to $8,377 million (31% of total), with 69% from outside the U.S., highlighting diversified geographic exposure. Cash flow sustainability is challenged by reduced operational cash flow but supported by financing inflows. Overall, NVIDIA appears to be investing for future growth with a focus on Compute & Networking, maintaining dividend payments, and leveraging financing, but must manage operational cash flow and cost pressures to sustain performance. |
