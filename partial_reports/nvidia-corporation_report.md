## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Adverse economic conditions may harm our business. Economic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future; increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduce our margins; decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers' or our licensees' inability to supply products to customers and/or end users; limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions; the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers, licensing parties or other third parties we rely on; reduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments. Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. These macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. | Adverse economic conditions may harm business, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending. Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on results of operations, particularly demand for products. Increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses have negatively impacted gross margin in the past and may do so in the future. Increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets have reduced and may in the future reduce margins. Decrease in demand for products, services and technologies and those of customers, partners or licensees may occur. The inability of suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments may harm business. Increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of financial instruments may also occur. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The market for products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. Competition is expected to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced or provide better performance or additional features. Competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution, and manufacturing resources, allowing them to adapt more effectively to customer or technological changes. Some customers have in-house expertise and can develop their own solutions, potentially replacing those provided. Competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants, and consolidations. Competitors' products may be cheaper or provide better functionality, resulting in lower-than-expected selling prices. Dependency on third-party suppliers reduces control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and delivery schedules. Failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led to mismatches between supply and demand, resulting in product shortages and excess inventory. Geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, could have a material adverse impact on business. The use of GPUs for unexpected applications, such as cryptocurrency mining, has impacted demand and created volatility. | The market for products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards.
